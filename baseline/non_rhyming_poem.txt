<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And all her life long: 
<start>She never gave a prayer, 
<start>Or a voice in her song. 
<start>They are good folk, they were not great folk, 
<start>They were in love and never spoke a word; 
<start>They were good folk, they were not bad folk, 
<start>They were in love and never died, 
<start>They were in love and never told a lie. 
<start>They are good folk, they were not good folk, 
<start>But they were good with life and never spoke a word; 
<start>They were good folk, they were in love and never died, 
<start>They were in love and never gave a prayer. 
<start>They were good folk, they were not bad folk, 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>Then came the liddle-bough 
<start>We've got the first-come-first-fruits. 
<start>The boughs on which we live 
<start>Are like the rose on the wing; 
<start>And in these boughs I may be free, 
<start>Though I cannot be alone. 
<start>My love, the sun is gone; 
<start>My love, the clouds are dark; 
<start>The stars do shine but when they glow 
<start>Let them be hid from light. 
<start>O how my love is faring, 
<start>My love, the star of day! 
<start>O love and day, with me to-night 
<start>Our way is narrow, 
<start>And
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>On the way to the battle of Lexington. 
<start>They rode like wolves across the dark, 
<start>And he came here as a slave. 
<start>They kissed their faces in red pride 
<start>And the eyes of the men on the sea, 
<start>And the women turned into men, 
<start>And the children of the dead and old 
<start>Passed through them like a dream. 
<start>The soldiers died and the women died, 
<start>And they sat on the battle-plain 
<start>And in their grief talked out of the past, 
<start>Out of it all. 
<start>They sang of the days of the world's past, 
<start>Out of it all. 
<start>We loved the flowers from
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>To keep the day all up. 
<start>But there's no way here to save them 
<start>When the sun comes down; 
<start>For no good things do they know 
<start>That they do not know. 
<start>They've lost their souls, dear lad, 
<start>And still they know it still. 
<start>If you'd love me still, 
<start>If 'twere a dream, 
<start>If a word of love you wrote, 
<start>There might be love, in truth, 
<start>That might well prove it truth. 
<start>For, after these three words, 
<start>I did not know 
<start>That love was dead; 
<start>And I did not think it dead;
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And with her they had been. 
<start>When the long, long rain was on the town, 
<start>And there were clouds of spray 
<start>We stopped by the roadside at the tavern-door, 
<start>And the winemen's heads were in the wine. 
<start>The water was sweet and the fire was bright 
<start>And the lamp shone red and the flame was true; 
<start>We drank a little and were satisfied; 
<start>The wine and bread we had we could not deny. 
<start>And then the fire flared and burst a little, 
<start>And the lamps were black with the smoke of the town. 
<start>And as we drank the little and were content, 
<start>And as we fanned our hair with the burning
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>Took their old loves for a ride 
<start>Till night came a-sailing; 
<start>They were dancing all night long 
<start>As they walked merrily; 
<start>They were singing all night long 
<start>In the churchyard shade. 
<start>Ah, they are there now, and yet 
<start>All the songs they bring I'll sing, 
<start>Till they can sing they'll sing again, 
<start>Till they can dance again. 
<start>The songs I sing are old and old, 
<start>The songs are new and new; 
<start>And the songs old are old and old 
<start>Are yet with men and maids; 
<start>The song old and old are old, 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>In a long procession to the end. 
<start>The little boys and girls, 
<start>And the little girls, 
<start>And the little boys and girls, 
<start>And the little boys and girls, 
<start>At the end were all singing all day long. 
<start>And the song died away, 
<start>As soon as it had given a start 
<start>Came the noise and the windings, and the clink of the drum. 
<start>When I heard it by the stream, 
<start>The wind blew wild, 
<start>It said, How sweet is the music 
<start>That dances around us when we sleep, 
<start>That the blue waves, 
<start>That are playing at daybreak, 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>I thought they were, but my heart beat faster, faster. 
<start>I must go to bed, 
<start>She said; and at the window 
<start>A lily 
<start>Rose up in the summer weather, 
<start>With red bloom. 
<start>She smiled. 
<start>I am tired. 
<start>How do 
<start>Those children do? 
<start>I would say  
<start>They're happy 
<start>And happy with me! 
<start>So soon as he looked back 
<start>He saw the little flower 
<start>A face 
<start>Sitting upon a straw bed. 
<start>I feel so lonely 
<start>I'm not 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>For Helen in her hour of need, 
<start>And Helen took the child 
<start>For to her mother she died in his arms, 
<start>And Helen bore him. 
<start>They sat there on her mother's knee, 
<start>And there was the child. 
<start>They could not believe their mother was dead, 
<start>For she came from her home and was gone. 
<start>Yet Helen lay upon her breast, forsooth, 
<start>To kiss his arm. 
<start>A mother's child comes home from the sea; 
<start>A mother's child's child shall come home again; 
<start>A mother's child shall come home again, 
<start>But Helen in her time was not wise; 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>Of him that was here. 
<start>But you, dear, were the only one 
<start>That saw that day. 
<start>But you, dear, were the only one, 
<start>That she did see. 
<start>Heard he the song? No; 
<start>The music of her foot-fall 
<start>Was still; 
<start>Heard he the song at first? No: 
<start>She smiled and wept, 
<start>For it was not the song that died, 
<start>The music he was there. 
<start>We, too, saw the old man pass; 
<start>But you to me were gone, 
<start>He came not back again, 
<start>But went not back 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And each had a different reason. 
<start>But their life never went 
<start>So smoothly like a dream, 
<start>Or aught else at all; 
<start>For a year was, or a thing, 
<start>That never went. 
<start>And then 
<start>His heart grew weary strong, 
<start>And his soul grew dim, 
<start>And I thought I might not go 
<start>And live again 
<start>For a year, 
<start>And a day after 
<start>He passed away. 
<start>I went to the house of God 
<start>Of the Three kings, 
<start>And the people said, 
<start>And they were all asleep, 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>With the love they had. 
<start>They lay there waiting, watching with open eyes, 
<start>Hanging, waiting, waiting, waiting, 
<start>For a chance with the man whom they were seeking, 
<start>At a window at the end of the room. 
<start>They saw the blue, the red, the yellow, 
<start>And the little birds,   a myriad birds, 
<start>And the sky and the moon, and stars, 
<start>And all that was strange about the world 
<start>And all that was strange about the earth. 
<start>They never saw the other birds, 
<start>Save when a little grey bird came,   a black and old owl,  
<start>A wild goose,   a brown
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>It was a happy night; 
<start>The young and the young, 
<start>Together, to the sea they were flung 
<start>Upon their golden strand. 
<start>The old and the new 
<start>Had wandered far away, 
<start>Singing sweetly together, 
<start>As old songs do. 
<start>The sweet and the sweet, 
<start>They had a tender sound; 
<start>The young and the young, 
<start>Together, to the sea they were flung 
<start>Under fairy sky. 
<start>They brought home their long lost children, 
<start>And their mother they have named 
<start>And all their joys and their sorrows 
<start>Made complete, 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>The same night they wedded; 
<start>But I could not bear 
<start>To be out of sight, 
<start>So I sailed away to the South Sea side instead. 
<start>In a dream some people said, 
<start>A little thing is lying where some people lay, 
<start>They lay an old woman on a mountain top 
<start>Sucking the honey-drops of the South Sea. 
<start>And after she has eaten so many a bit, 
<start>She says, 'Dear, what have you done to it?' again. 
<start>It seemed to me that one day, 
<start>In a sweet and beautiful dream, 
<start>Old Ocean said, 
<start>She looked into him and found her son, 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And soon they were wed; 
<start>And soon they were wed in the courtly land  
<start>My Love! you cried, to my dear Love! 
<start>Love! that was the thing: 
<start>I wooed my lovely Love in the wood 
<start>A thousand times. 
<start>Then they wooed again in their blissful way, 
<start>And I found her in the wood. 
<start>Sweet was the song, sweet was the merry ditty; 
<start>The maids of the wood sang o'er the daffodils; 
<start>The fairies danced, the maids o'er the lawns. 
<start>Love! they cried, they wept, and wept: 
<start>Then the maids
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>They were both of olden time. 
<start>That were a jest; I wish you to say! 
<start>But tell me if you ever were afraid; 
<start>It's hard to be afraid; I know I am not afraid. 
<start>The old men came out to pray, 
<start>With a loud call for help and aid; 
<start>The poor men said to ask but they 
<start>Had never been born so low. 
<start>They gave them good clothes and clothes so gray, 
<start>The poor men said to pray, 
<start>The old men said to say, but they 
<start>Have never been born so low. 
<start>Some came in the morning and cried loud, 
<start>But I have not seen
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And the world was changed 
<start>Out of the old world as I saw it with my naked eyes! 
<start>With their eyes they did not look 
<start>I should be a nun with my bare feet wet with the sand. 
<start>They seemed like two little children 
<start>With a small heart beating still. 
<start>Over them they smiled with love, 
<start>And we were two girls  
<start>We were two sisters two little children 
<start>Who love to go out and play. 
<start>It was April then 
<start>And the summer in me 
<start>And the sweet birds in the air 
<start>And the trees that round me were swinging. 
<start>My little white hand went into the garden, 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>They were angry and old. 
<start>But when the time draws near they take 
<start>A journey on the way. 
<start>The children round them turn and go, 
<start>And, in their minds revolving, dance, 
<start>While the old man is playing alone. 
<start>When the times draw near, they take 
<start>A joyous journey on the way. 
<start>But when that time draws near, they stop, 
<start>Unafraid of danger or control, 
<start>And all the children are alone. 
<start>They do not know how they can forget 
<start>The time draws near, 
<start>For there is neither summer nor spring, 
<start>Nor summer nor spring. 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And mad for me; 
<start>And I thought I'd never tell 
<start>The truth. And then I thought there was nothing to tell, 
<start>And thought she was a girl! I was a girl; 
<start>And I thought she'd be mine; and I made the choice; 
<start>And I said I'd go where the people go, and not 
<start>Be in the way I ought. And so I was; 
<start>Until at last it started to ache and ache, 
<start>Till in the light of the moon, a light that seemed to burn, 
<start>I saw, I caught 
<start>Till it burned in flames. I had a girl's body at my side, 
<start>And I looked out through a
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>We had not all, and yet the day 
<start>I heard the thunder near the stream; 
<start>With me in haste they rode, 
<start>With me at rest, 
<start>With me at rest, 
<start>With me at rest, 
<start>With me at rest: 
<start>Sudden they came; 
<start>And like a flash of fire, 
<start>With lightning struck them up, 
<start>Like sparks of lightning shot 
<start>From the white cloud; so I was sure, 
<start>Till a swift flash fell, and away 
<start>Swiftly was come their way - 
<start>And, then of course, 
<start>Back again they went. 
<start>Oh,
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>I love and would not harm you, 
<start>But they made you afraid of them. 
<start>And he said, I will have her, 
<start>I will not be afraid; 
<start>And I turned and kissed her, 
<start>But she was not pleased. 
<start>She had no time to speak 
<start>Because she couldn't move; 
<start>I kissed her; she couldn't help, 
<start>Nor could she hold me. 
<start>She would have done nothing 
<start>If I should know 
<start>At this very moment 
<start>If I should be forgiven. 
<start>She made a very merry, 
<start>Very merry, 
<start>The wedding of a May-night 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And did their prayers without cessation. 
<start>There was ever one who thought he was a man! 
<start>They would not meet and love one another. 
<start>Here I stand, and when he said It didn't do you any good, 
<start>I think that I was angry, and said I was just because he thought 
<start>You didn't listen to him, which is quite shocking, sir, 
<start>And that you did not see him, and that you didn't hear him, sir. 
<start>You know how much you greatly love the little red cat, 
<start>And how it's like to wear a hood in your hair, sir, for a day. 
<start>He always looks funny when he can't see the sunlight; 
<start>But as you can
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>To know that you were sweet, 
<start>Your eyes were in heaven and eyes in the heavens high, 
<start>And your beauty that was true! 
<start>Love has gone into the garden 
<start>To bring the blossoms home, 
<start>And they grew in a dream-like beauty 
<start>And a heart in her breast. 
<start>And they are gone 
<start>To the dark woods where they lay 
<start>For the love they had for you. 
<start>And the lark now is calling 
<start>In his wild hollow song, 
<start>And the robin sings 
<start>In the night-time of song, 
<start>And the linnet sings 
<start>Under the moon's light. 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>They loved to meet the sea, 
<start>And we thought they were a fairy tale 
<start>When they left us all. 
<start>But we came home for joy, 
<start>And saw the earth beneath. 
<start>She was fair, but yet so fair, her face was sad, 
<start>The sea was black with sorrow: she was gray 
<start>And we thought that they were a fairy tale, 
<start>When we brought them home for joy. 
<start>And so we came home, then, 
<start>In love and sorrow for to share, 
<start>For they were one we loved to live to understand, 
<start>And we loved to meet, for we knew not what to do, 
<start>And they loved to be
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>They danced and sang. 
<start>At last she reached the garden-ground 
<start>And sought the tree by moonlight pale. 
<start>The lily on the edge of pale 
<start>A little pale, and there I placed 
<start>It upon the grass. 
<start>At last I found her and I took it home, 
<start>And left it at my feet. 
<start>At last I learned to do and speak 
<start>And laugh and be glad and cry, 
<start>When at the hour when she was far away 
<start>I said to her, I love you. 
<start>She kissed me and went to the garden-ground 
<start>To find the flower in its place: 
<start>Then in a minute
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And in war with the rest, 
<start>To see me now to meet them. 
<start>A strange woman stood alone, 
<start>With the look of a woman; 
<start>She seemed to be a child, 
<start>With her arms outstretched, 
<start>And her face as brown as snow, 
<start>And her eyes looking down the sky, 
<start>And to see a girl alone 
<start>As she looked down below me. 
<start>A strange woman held herself aloof 
<start>In the depths of a lake, 
<start>As I saw her stand, in a dusky mist 
<start>Of cloud and snow, 
<start>And the light of the moon descending to an empty shell, 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>They could not speak, 
<start>But one who had forgot his friend 
<start>Had a big heart and was very wise, 
<start>And he vowed you would not ask him why. 
<start>And all night long at his side he slept, 
<start>But if it went to heart or brain, 
<start>He swore he would not try to tell her; 
<start>And all night long he heard a wail  
<start>As her eyes grew bright. 
<start>The old clock struck; the moon rose up; 
<start>The star burned high; 
<start>The house shut down, the stars were gone. 
<start>And out across the moonlight went 
<start>A strange ghost, I cannot say which,  
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And as they were together, 
<start>They sat with me and laughed, and all day long 
<start>We had lain dreaming together together. 
<start>And as we rested so 
<start>We thought of Christmas when love was over. 
<start>No! neither of them was ever merry; 
<start>We thought of love long ago. 
<start>And as we sat and thought of love, 
<start>We thought of what had been left behind us 
<start>As of the year gone by, 
<start>And we thought, Dear mother, what this time will be, 
<start>If we do not love and cherish us. 
<start>I saw three suns set, and I saw a thousand pearls, 
<start>We heard a thousand voices
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>We met, the way we went. 
<start>And we both took off our hats and 
<start>We drove the house along 
<start>O'er the plain to the farm o' the cattle, 
<start>Where the reapers reap the hay! 
<start>The cows with the corn strewed around us, 
<start>The cattle come and go, 
<start>We took off our hats and 
<start>We drove the house along. 
<start>And on the plain 
<start>We met a flock of cattle, 
<start>Battling through the night. 
<start>The red-coats came the cattle, 
<start>The cocks the cattle overhung; 
<start>The corn came out in the heat, 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>When a' the King he met; 
<start>At their home they took a' wad woo, 
<start>But he ne'er woo'd them back again. 
<start>It were an age for folly, 
<start>An age for fame, 
<start>The man that was a-wingin' 
<start>To his cussard hame. 
<start>Yet now o'er her I've seen, 
<start>Her look upon me deen, 
<start>Her face is gane drouth, drouth, and dim; 
<start>But she's now awa' to see; 
<start>Wi' glee and glee, wi' glee, doun.' 
<start>And wi' a sigh and a sigh 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>With each other, and had not to break their vows. 
<start>The mother sighed and sighed, 
<start>The mother sighed and sighed, 
<start>And in their arms she laid them. 
<start>The father lay there still, 
<start>The sisters had not done away without him; 
<start>They had not done away with him. 
<start>Alas!   Alas! 
<start>And now the mother looked her down, 
<start>Gaze of deep sorrow cast her eye the other way: 
<start>The father leaned in silence, and he whispered low, 
<start>A father is dead and father lies asleep.  
<start>Mother, the very thought of that night 
<start>Have left no room in his breast to mourn. 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>With all things good; 
<start>And all things good, and all things evil 
<start>Was never the same! 
<start>The old folks knew it all, and so 
<start>They did not try to keep it right; 
<start>But every day they came to that 
<start>So bad. 
<start>The new folks knew it a long time past, 
<start>And so they did it very much, too; 
<start>They knew the old people's talk 
<start>And little things, 
<start>And their way, and their way, 
<start>To the church they went; 
<start>They couldn't forget it all the rest 
<start>For to-day. 
<start>But then again the old folk came
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>That night I was at her feet. 
<start>She said: 
<start>Good-night, my pretty flower! 
<start>We have not parted, she said, 
<start>Until your eyes have seen, she said: 
<start>I am here to welcome you 
<start>With every good-night kiss. 
<start>Then she, in sad surprise, 
<start>Felt her fingers on my thigh 
<start>And her lips on mine were wet, 
<start>And her fingers on my thigh 
<start>Were wet in that wild surprise. 
<start>What are you in your dreams, she said, 
<start>When the evening sun sinks low, 
<start>And the little light shines on the moon, 
<start>And you
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And they had heard the news, 
<start>And the little children, 
<start>And the mother's weeping, 
<start>And she stood and cried in sorrow. 
<start>And my mother 
<start>Gave her a tear, 
<start>That she could not go  
<start>They had heard the news, 
<start>And she could not see 
<start>That the news was true. 
<start>But the little feet 
<start>And the little hands 
<start>I did touch, 
<start>And I strove to touch them well, 
<start>But I could not, 
<start>So I cried in sorrow; 
<start>And her little feet, 
<start>That she must go, 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>Both were to the right. 
<start>The same had been his fate, 
<start>The same had been his bliss; 
<start>The same had been his will, 
<start>The same had been his deed; 
<start>And he was slain so bravely 
<start>That, like a dove, 
<start>No more he would return to her 
<start>By night or day. 
<start>I could look up once in all my life, 
<start>The same as if the dawn I viewed 
<start>Had broken the day 
<start>Before that night, and I could look again, 
<start>And see again 
<start>The same as now. 
<start>I could look down once, for shame and grief, 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>To leave the village. 
<start>The men of Arcady, they called these 
<start>Fancies true. 
<start>With a merry dance they came and went, 
<start>And up among the throng 
<start>Rayed out in songs of praise 
<start>The fairies, they that came from Arcady, 
<start>And sang the same 
<start>That one day they made some village 
<start>For the rest! 
<start>The maidens' voices, sweet as bard's 
<start>Mangled the hall, 
<start>The merry men of Arcady, all 
<start>At once laughed out of the street, 
<start>And sang the same. 
<start>With a merry dance they came and went,
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>To leave such a stranger home. 
<start>We thought it would be vain, with care, 
<start>The wild dog's drowsy play, 
<start>To make a sudden retreat from him 
<start>At every step. 
<start>But in spite of all we thought, 
<start>He had such a pleasant home, 
<start>Each time we tried to fly him thence 
<start>He had no care. 
<start>We thought it would be vain to bear 
<start>This thing alone, 
<start>When in the night we saw him, he was gone, 
<start>And we were all afraid to turn away! 
<start>But alas! and long will wait, or worse! 
<start>For one short hour to die! 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>While I watch your face. 
<start>I feel like you, who, like the day, 
<start>Have brought us here today 
<start>Back from the days gone by so bright 
<start>Of childhood long ago. 
<start>Then I'm thinking of you, when in dreams 
<start>The first light glints through; 
<start>Oh, let me dream again of you 
<start>With you alive again. 
<start>And I wish you were there to say what was said 
<start>When all is lost and lost, 
<start>That, like a dream, you will not wake and go; 
<start>And you must stay, dear, till I am dead! 
<start>Though all my strength is spent, dear, and still 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>With the old man and the children fair, 
<start>And the old man's pride, 
<start>His heart was broken; 
<start>And the child was torn, 
<start>For the heart there is 
<start>For the son of Bethlehem. 
<start>With the head of a beast, 
<start>Toiled on the water, 
<start>For the heart there is 
<start>For the son of Bethlehem. 
<start>In the little chapel he sat, 
<start>As on an island, 
<start>And from the churchyard he sang 
<start>Old songs of old renown; 
<start>Then on the rock he fell; 
<start>And a song of an ocean 
<start>He singeth well, 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>Who gave me so much. 
<start>My life is a sad place; and I 
<start>Are old and gray, and weary and 
<start>All in a dream. 
<start>I have learned to love you at last, 
<start>And I hold you faithful in my heart; 
<start>But I am the best companion 
<start>And only friend. 
<start>I know a day when the rain-waves break, 
<start>When the storm sweeps along the rocks, 
<start>And the waves of water are hot 
<start>And deep and hot and wet; 
<start>And sometimes I wake and think of the light 
<start>There is always a light beside, 
<start>The little flower within me, that smiles  
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>My love, sweet heart! ah, think not I 
<start>Would have you know the way. How very true; 
<start>But oh, what is this bitter world about! 
<start>I should remember when I was born, 
<start>I was a very young lad: 
<start>I stood beside my mother at the door, 
<start>And whispered to her of how I thought 
<start>Love should be the man that should be mine. 
<start>I should forget how all my life had been 
<start>Piecemeal of love-dreams, till I knew 
<start>The little green fields far over, and heard 
<start>And knew the stars at that hour 
<start>Coming clear across the sky. 
<start>Sweet, I
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>When they all went for hunting; 
<start>It's always summer when I meet you in a hurry, 
<start>And you know I've gone to dinner. 
<start>When the moon is low and the world is still but the sun has not set. 
<start>The night is getting hot, the weather's very rough, 
<start>But at last the sun is setting; 
<start>It's the same at home, my dear, 
<start>With my mother and sister on the hillside. 
<start>To the west is falling like a crimson cloud, 
<start>The sky is blue and clear; 
<start>And the little stars are singing sweet 
<start>And little brown birds singing on the side of the hill. 
<start>To the north is falling like an
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>Since then and I'm waiting for it. 
<start>A man's life and a heart is two. 
<start>One is of love; 
<start>The other of peace. 
<start>In the morning the sky is white, 
<start>The sunset the night. 
<start>Oh, my God, I thought I might hear the bells sing, 
<start>But alas for the poor one, 
<start>He's got his eyes filled with tears over and o'er 
<start>His head and his belly fill. 
<start>As the birds sing one night and the night after, 
<start>He can never understand 
<start>The music of the bells. 
<start>Oh, my God, a man's life and a heart may be two.
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>As of your fingers! 
<start>Where's the little girl at the door? 
<start>I've heard you say: 
<start>Oh, that little girl I've known! 
<start>We'd like to marry! she asks, 
<start>And smiles and looks. 
<start>It matters not, of course, 
<start>Who knows what other people do  
<start>If it's a nice little girl 
<start>With eyes and hair. 
<start>The house is in a state of decay, 
<start>The windows are all closed; 
<start>When I go out, or walk the street, 
<start>The dust is all the ground about, 
<start>The house is in a state of decay, 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>With their daily play, 
<start>Their little game of cards 
<start>Sink and sleep in the grave; 
<start>They were very sleepy, 
<start>And it made them seem 
<start>But a grave-encampment dark. 
<start>As we sat in the gloom, 
<start>The light was shining bright; 
<start>We did not fear to go 
<start>Over the path to rest; 
<start>Only a little grass 
<start>That overgrown the wood did show. 
<start>And still it is the spring, 
<start>With the leaves grown green the grass, 
<start>To the way it runs along; 
<start>There shall never be no more to come 
<start>To our dear home
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>To please yourself 
<start>And tell my story. 
<start>Not alone for my own sake 
<start>With his own hands I laid the pen, 
<start>And his own heart, 
<start>And the only one that has it. 
<start>Let me make known to you 
<start>The way which you have made me. 
<start>One day you were out hunting with us with the best of the best 
<start>And then you saw all over the ground the dead deer lying on the hay. 
<start>And you are glad indeed. 
<start>Not alone for my own sake 
<start>All the deer had died. 
<start>But you have also made me glad 
<start>With his own hands, O Death, and they
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>To greet and caress and be 
<start>A part of your heart's soft charm 
<start>To share my fate and me. 
<start>I miss the tender blue eye, 
<start>And the gentle touch of hands, 
<start>And your smiling eyes of youth, 
<start>That look with tenderness 
<start>On the bright sunshine of your soul: 
<start>I miss what you have said to me 
<start>With a tender care of heart and mind. 
<start>I miss the love of your smile, 
<start>Your love of your hand-made things; 
<start>I miss the kiss of your hand, 
<start>And your hand on my heart! 
<start>Yet you have given me, when I was young
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And they were mad and in pain. 
<start>Their hearts were beating fast 
<start>Through the long day of doubt, 
<start>While at each step a star 
<start>Was out of sight, 
<start>O'er her dim hair she flung 
<start>A shadow on the dark, 
<start>That to the world went down. 
<start>And then, the moon was lit 
<start>By a silver, gold star. 
<start>They sat by the water bed, 
<start>They stood by the fire, 
<start>And the stars looked up as one, 
<start>So it seemed each with its own light. 
<start>When the sun looked down on them 
<start>They sank into sleep. 
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>Through your heart, and you have heard my words, 
<start>Yet the last line I do not know it all, 
<start>And may write another when the world is good, 
<start>In the light that I hold with you. 
<start>The song is written for me. 
<start>I've sung it all alone since youth begun, 
<start>And I've known its deepness, in the calm of dream, 
<start>That the old year has sent me back, the spring, the sun. 
<start>Oh, you had thought me wise, if you had looked at me 
<start>With your full eyes in your soft light; and knew I was 
<start>So kind that I was, for one short moment, glad to meet 
<start>The morning
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And so they married 
<start>Who are, I don't know, 
<start>Or the men that have 
<start>They gave a woman 
<start>A wife that did no wrong 
<start>Was happy to be so; 
<start>And that was my wife, but ah, my heart! 
<start>It is well, to be fair 
<start>With a man who would have married 
<start>But he did not. 
<start>My little boy 
<start>Was born and bred on her, 
<start>And she is very happy, 
<start>Being happy in her 
<start>To-night. 
<start>I'll tell you some stories 
<start>How, in a month or so 
<start>In
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>To play upon this day, and for what you care. 
<start>In this letter my name is Richard C. 
<start>I grew up in the days of summer 
<start>The woods where I wandered were beautiful. 
<start>My father was a farmer and always loved to talk 
<start>Of his days in the woods there; and would always ask 
<start>What were the pleasant ways he used to leave behind. 
<start>He never told me what to do, I guess, 
<start>But would sometimes give a hint and I guess 
<start>He was always a pretty good fellow. 
<start>He was a boy and I am grown by the day 
<start>Whenever father was in school, 
<start>And when my mother always was at home 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>And not their own. 
<start>No word was spoken, 
<start>Yet their heart beat hard  
<start>It took each other so, 
<start>But we knew they lived 
<start>For them, for us. 
<start>And all, the very ones 
<start>That we loved, 
<start>Were here or there. 
<start>And soon they died; 
<start>But each one loved 
<start>With an immortal heart,  
<start>And each one died. 
<start>But we can tell 
<start>And they must keep 
<start>And cherish 
<start>A little thing  
<start>A little thing. 
<start>One morning, 
<start>When the rain was
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>Till they reached the sea, 
<start>And as the seas roll onward, 
<start>Toward the ocean's edge, 
<start>In many a whirl and twist,  
<start>Then they fell and fled. 
<start>We had one good laugh 
<start>At the end of the day, 
<start>One good and steady way 
<start>Across the sea, 
<start>And through the sunbeam stealing, 
<start>And then they fell and fled. 
<start>In many a wise, 
<start>Sorrowful, and sad, 
<start>But we did not leave the ship, 
<start>Not while they were swimming 
<start>That day, 
<start>For I knew that you were going 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>I saw them twain. 
<start>Oh, mother of mine, why were you, 
<start>How long ago, I pray? 
<start>You were my baby and my son: 
<start>You did not fail. 
<start>Mother of me? 
<start>How long ago did you forget 
<start>So little of me? 
<start>You are young and meek and brave, 
<start>And I remember still 
<start>What I had known before 
<start>When I was young, but now 
<start>I feel you are older. 
<start>Where are all my dreams of you, 
<start>And must I be alone 
<start>In your mother's bower 
<start>Where I live alone 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>For lovers, and his love for me. 
<start>He made my heart too weak to give 
<start>A second kiss, 
<start>While a woman in her dream-land came; 
<start>He stood like a huge stone walled in gold. 
<start>I went and kissed her, but she turned and went. 
<start>God did all that is best 
<start>In the first day of His blessed season, 
<start>When first He kissed Himself. 
<start>He held its holy cross above my brow 
<start>With its crown o'er my head. 
<start>On the face and on the lips was all His grace, 
<start>But all His love seemed new; 
<start>And the soul within me was but a mist-world
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>To keep her, so she went away 
<start>To her cottage at the Northumberland. 
<start>The very first that she met him 
<start>Was in this house, that old house, 
<start>Where he knew no little children, 
<start>And the children's mouths would say, 
<start>Says he, The children are no good. 
<start>He had a little book on his back, 
<start>And he handed it to him, 
<start>And he did not look at it with a frown, 
<start>And he could not read it long: 
<start>That you have come to see your little one 
<start>You will find nothing much to do. 
<start>With a little more of good, that boy 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>For him that broke their chains. 
<start>Tiny boys and little girls 
<start>Came dancing down the street 
<start>To see him dance in green, 
<start>And when he danced to-day 
<start>They came at last to see him play. 
<start>Little boys and playthings 
<start>Like pretty children; 
<start>But what it makes them cry and cry 
<start>Is, when he dances to-morrow 
<start>He's not far away. 
<start>So you should sit beside the water 
<start>And sip along the stream, 
<start>And watch as little children cry, 
<start>He hasn't gone away 
<start>For very long. 
<start>So in my play-
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>But you were true, they said, 
<start>And I was true to them, 
<start>Though I might not tell you why. 
<start>I heard you laugh and say, 
<start>I loved your eyes so well, 
<start>I loved the ways you led them 
<start>To the paths they trod. 
<start>I kissed you there, your lips 
<start>Were blue and white; 
<start>And, oh, the joy that came 
<start>To you was sweet and clear. 
<start>And then they went home together 
<start>And she said: 
<start>Well, I love you very much; 
<start>I'd think 
<start>I loved you long last year, and yet, 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>There at our inn, my dearie, 
<start>Went out to dinner-time. 
<start>They were very happy, 
<start>And they laughed and talked a jest, 
<start>With a pretty fine heart, 
<start>And a pretty pretty face. 
<start>They laughed and talked a jest, 
<start>With a pretty fine heart, 
<start>And a pretty pretty face, 
<start>But their laughter never ceased; 
<start>And their laughter ever waned; 
<start>At length the little girl's 
<start>Turned out to love her husband. 
<start>But as she was walking here, 
<start>A dog crept by, he grew fat, 
<start>And he went to feed her,
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>Away from strife. 
<start>Now the sun is up and the darkness is gray, 
<start>And over the dark I sit like a loon, 
<start>A thing of the sea, 
<start>And in my dream I dream of the moon: 
<start>The shadow of the moon on the hills, 
<start>And the wind on the sea. 
<start>And the dream was a joy to my heart, 
<start>The sky was stilly and the storm was still, 
<start>And the sun came out behind me when I awoke, 
<start>To see the old white clouds at noon, 
<start>And my spirit stirred in my soul. 
<start>And a little gray moth goes by, 
<start>And my soul is away for
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>This very autumn-day. 
<start>A boy from school at last my path I tread. 
<start>He said I was like that boy who came 
<start>Through forests, and across a land-locked sea. 
<start>He said I was like that boy from school 
<start>Who loved his country and the children dear: 
<start>He is our hero to the last. 
<start>His hands are clasped in the little arms 
<start>Of my father and my mother, whose fond love 
<start>Has made me strong in every need. 
<start>He said I was like his, the youth I loved, 
<start>And, as the light of the old sun grew dim, 
<start>My love for him will be strong as the love that
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>My eyes ache when I see you 
<start>Come up the stair, 
<start>I'm sure we'll meet again to-morrow, 
<start>I know not how, 
<start>She said. 
<start>I look in each and every eye you, 
<start>She said in that tone, 
<start>All of my heart aches just thinking of you 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you 
<start>Come up the stairs, 
<start>I can see in the dark you, 
<start>I can see why yet, 
<start>I feel so lonely and I'm sure our lives are one 
<start>In that dark place, 
<start>And my heart aches just thinking of you, 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>All alone: 
<start>And you are such a precious gem 
<start>That I have nothing left to mourn, 
<start>If nothing ever goes wrong 
<start>With one good soul! 
<start>My love is dead, and a friend has been my friend all 
<start>many a year 
<start>Since I looked on him: now he lies and mourns 
<start>Like one who goes to the grave with a tearful glance 
<start>On my heart, 
<start>Where the wind blows across the fields and the skies 
<start>With a tearful look; 
<start>And by night, that's the time he's gone away, 
<start>And by day I've been asleep; 
<start>But that's so long since
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>When first I saw her 
<start>And heard her say 
<start>I will get her soon, 
<start>Though I think she must be dead. 
<start>The sweetest maid, when, worn with care, 
<start>She sleeps upon the breast of ease, 
<start>She has a secret grief to share, 
<start>If with the dew-drop she stirs at noon. 
<start>But, lo! the sun grows cold; the dew's out 
<start>And yet is still in the rosebuds' spring: 
<start>The lilies that by evening grow 
<start>Are pale and sweet to the eye. 
<start>And this night she turns to me 
<start>For I am not a virgin now. 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And the time that it is we are gone. 
<start>Oh, this is the very sea, you know, 
<start>The shore of the infinite deep, the white-crested surf, 
<start>The sand and sand from the shore of the far sea 
<start>Like a tide that flows, and there is none 
<start>To-day beneath it and in the sunset it dies, 
<start>That it floats over you like a foam-fish's death; 
<start>Foam is not so white as life and foam is so cold, 
<start>But there is no face from a face in the sea, no light from you, 
<start>It is the land of your soul and never a man. 
<start>As the wind blows the sea over sea waves
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And the little thing was their pride 
<start>To see the big house and the house of the house of the soul. 
<start>The house of the soul 
<start>They were sad the house, 
<start>The house of the soul to see, 
<start>And they would not come out to see the house of the soul; 
<start>But he sat at the window, 
<start>With her hand on his hair. 
<start>One of the little things 
<start>The little girl was telling 
<start>At her mother's wedding 
<start>On the way home she went forth. 
<start>The pretty thing 
<start>The little girl was going to tell to her son, 
<start>And he knew she was very sore, 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>And our father told us, 
<start>As we sat him up and down, 
<start>And his eyes grew brighter. 
<start>That is the old story; 
<start>It is a pretty old tale of an old man, 
<start>A poor lad living with a wife and child, 
<start>All his life in poverty and ill; 
<start>And when he reached his little home in town, 
<start>He would say to all the people there, 
<start>Go back to bed, for you shall find him not the same; 
<start>In poverty and ill. 
<start>Then he went down to his father's farm-shed, 
<start>To his own old sheep's-fold, 
<start>And the shepherd said, You'll find your
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>Somewhere in the sky, 
<start>They were dead, their bones 
<start>Tremble beneath the weight 
<start>Of what to do. 
<start>They are dead that are glad, 
<start>They are dead in the wood, 
<start>No one knows them. 
<start>I come, you are free, 
<start>I come, you are free; 
<start>Let us die alone, 
<start>Free, fair, and brave, 
<start>And sing that song, 
<start>O for your sake, 
<start>O for your sake 
<start>O for your heaven 
<start>Give us the kiss! 
<start>I came and went, I was sad and weary for aye, 
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>And the calm of your voice. 
<start>Let us not fail; we are not weak 
<start>Through the years, we are not slaves; 
<start>Our minds are not bound to the things 
<start>We would have been born for. 
<start>We have done what we dreamed of 
<start>When the sun arose from its lair, 
<start>And I have known and cared the thing 
<start>It is that is worth while. 
<start>I have known the things it is worth 
<start>While it lasts! I have known the ways 
<start>The soul can never forget. 
<start>I have seen the face that is fair 
<start>Under the sunny sky 
<start>By the brooklet's deep bough 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>That day 
<start>For I know what they were mad and in love... 
<start>They say that the red smoke 
<start>Of the morning had gone, 
<start>As one of them thought was 
<start>In an old book, and a 
<start>Dark blue 
<start>And black 
<start>Stare at us. 
<start>And then it was a sight of blue 
<start>And red smoke 
<start>And a white, high face 
<start>That was as if it were a dream. 
<start>They did not say it, 
<start>They did not say  
<start>That the dawn 
<start>Had vanished! 
<start>They did not say 'She is lying 
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>On the day when you died and there were no men 
<start>In that old year.  I have written many, 
<start>And I am in it now, thinking of you  
<start>Your last, and now mine. 
<start>Then I asked this: Is not your last 
<start>With the good old man with long gray hair, 
<start>With the old man with long brown eyes, 
<start>And the old person who was laughing 
<start>Like a child and a little babe 
<start>When he died? 
<start>He is laughing now. 
<start>And the young man with long brown hair 
<start>Is singing in the tree and the lane 
<start>And playing with the birds in the grass 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>Of the old man and his troubles. 
<start>They would say, We shall not go home together... 
<start>We shall never know them again. 
<start>It was evening, and the skies were clear and chill, 
<start>But the heart of the sky was dim and still; 
<start>The mist was on the garden's edge, 
<start>And a breeze had kissed the sky.... 
<start>The sky burned like molten lead; 
<start>There was frost on the branches. 
<start>A shadow passed by  
<start>Fell at the doorway.... 
<start>The mist ran into the garden, and the light went out  
<start>We went out with the wind... until the old man came down. 
<start>It was the mist over
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>From the heart within me. Tell me now, 
<start>And the word I am asking is Love, 
<start>And it means Peace; for this is he. 
<start>He is the light of life; he is my soul  
<start>My God, and then my Love, my peace; 
<start>For I have been as God would have me be, 
<start>And so have he called me. He is my God! 
<start>I am he, and he is the soul and head, 
<start>And his God is my Soul, my Peace; and oh my Heart, 
<start>If I ever could come back to you 
<start>Before you were dead and still are I 
<start>From the strife's fierce and tempest and the sea 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>When I think of you. 
<start>I'm going to the park;  
<start>The flowers are green 
<start>And the birds are singing. 
<start>Then away it goes, 
<start>They gather the leaves. 
<start>There's something in my head  
<start>A secret I find. 
<start>I know a little place  
<start>They have a lot to tell. 
<start>I may be dead  
<start>How can I say it? 
<start>I've only done a thing, 
<start>They never gave me any more! 
<start>And I love you? 
<start>I can't tell what they think. 
<start>I love you,  
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And I was alone. 
<start>We were in the middle of the day, 
<start>And as the stars rose and fell 
<start>And my hands clomb the garden gate 
<start>You would have known us, 
<start>But never you. 
<start>There was a lady of very fine colouring, 
<start>I have seen in many a ditty her beauty, 
<start>But if that lady do not appear. 
<start>I know not, I cannot tell you what I am, 
<start>She is so young and so fair and fair to-day; 
<start>Her eyes are blue, 
<start>Her hair is like some golden pearl, 
<start>She comes so near to me 
<start>That I love her very
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>In the dark, like a wounded bird. 
<start>For I will not weep 
<start>For you; 
<start>For the sun is shining 
<start>In my white rose-branch, for the love 
<start>I feel when you stand in June. 
<start>And though there be roses 
<start>O'er my rose-branch, 
<start>O'er my rose-branch, 
<start>O! never again 
<start>Will Love grow weary 
<start>Over me, 
<start>In the dark. 
<start>There's another rose I 
<start>Will cherish, 
<start>My new love has gone 
<start>And I'm sick of tears. 
<start>And
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>In the wild Summer days, 
<start>And many a time the day passed by, 
<start>And it was midnight, and night was near. 
<start>They lay in the shade at the foot of the hill, 
<start>But when they came back to the forest place, 
<start>And they saw the old tree growing tall and old, 
<start>They would not move again. 
<start>They watched the green boughs rustle till the sun shone dim, 
<start>And there lay the little green boughs that stood high up in the air, 
<start>And never a bird passed over them in the long green hours, 
<start>Save the shy old ones at the foot of the hill, 
<start>The ones that were sleeping near the boughs. 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And that I did not know you had not known; 
<start>And so I lay on the sofa beside 
<start>With my eyes shut tight and my hand on my breast  
<start>And so I lay on the sofa beside him so close; 
<start>For oh! what a strange and wonderful dream, 
<start>That we were so near, so close, and so free 
<start>And so much alike, to the dear old life, 
<start>And life that is past away; and yet that 
<start>Is but to love you, and to kiss you, the whole day 
<start>Until you grow more true and tender and fair. 
<start>I felt within my soul a touch of light 
<start>That touched a thing I was afraid to share; 
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>And the sweet sweet tone of your dear hand, 
<start>For the lips where your eye meets mine; 
<start>For the songs you sung that I sang;  
<start>For the words that you sang. 
<start>Now I look to eternity, 
<start>The day that gave me the birthright 
<start>To speak out of your lips and to hold 
<start>The sacred promise that I had: 
<start>Of the joy that you shall receive 
<start>To know that the world is a place of rest. 
<start>The sun is shining.  All my time has gone 
<start>Since my body was young and red. 
<start>But it seems to me that he goes not where 
<start>Thou canst gaze so much
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>About the moonlight. 
<start>They danced to the moonlight 
<start>Round and round 
<start>Upon the sand. 
<start>Their hearts ached and their limbs ached. 
<start>But the moonlight never forsook them 
<start>As they danced to the moonlight. 
<start>The old moon moved in shadow and silence; 
<start>But the moonlight never forsook them 
<start>As it danced on the sand. 
<start>The grey moon was on the sea-shore, 
<start>The gray waves were on the wind! 
<start>The grey waves beat fiercely and beat fiercely 
<start>For the glory 
<start>That broke white and grey from the white moon. 
<start>I heard a whisper,
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And laughing at my eyes: 
<start>As I feel the hand of God on your heart 
<start>He holds me warm and dear. 
<start>Oh, that my heart should live in Heav'n, 
<start>And be thy bed again; 
<start>The cradle of my heart should be 
<start>My home again; 
<start>For, in thy bosom, I would lie 
<start>And weep and weep and weep. 
<start>For never shall I weary by the Sea, 
<start>Nor weary by the Wind; 
<start>Though I am weary, and weary of all things, 
<start>Though I have died, for thee, 
<start>I have loved my dear beloved, and shall weep 
<start>For
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>With every joy that comes my way. 
<start>I never knew you well, you know, 
<start>And my heart aches yet, while you sleep, 
<start>In the cold silence of my heart. 
<start>I always felt so tired and lone, 
<start>So poor and poor, so lonely and cold. 
<start>I'll bring you all my children three 
<start>And bring you all my old and young. 
<start>I'll make you all my children three, 
<start>I'll make you all my children three, 
<start>And I shall take your body from you 
<start>And bring you me to you again. 
<start>I'll take you all my children three, 
<start>I'll make you all my
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>Nor can my heart endure nor can I. 
<start>Now the little lilt 
<start>Flutters and dies, 
<start>Leaving a trail of tears and sighs among 
<start>The tangled shadows and the dust 
<start>Of that dim, dim, and lonely place; 
<start>The heartstrings, the thoughts, 
<start>Feel so full of sweetness on my tongue. 
<start>The sun's red gleam 
<start>Blown across the grass 
<start>And left white in my cheek, white in my hand. 
<start>I must lie still all night, 
<start>St. Gabriel kneeling at His feet, 
<start>He said he'd say to me again:  
<start>God, save me of y
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>To make it better than all my own 
<start>If I can tell you what she meant 
<start>The world had always been full and gay 
<start>But with my pen I took the matter as an excuse 
<start>To finish and to close the poem up; 
<start>It isn't as bad as I could take it 
<start>But all I can say is 'No', I wouldn't do it. 
<start>The world has always been full of men, 
<start>And what is to be done with that? 
<start>I am tired of women, I can't understand, 
<start>And I am weary with men 
<start>But you should love me to the end. 
<start>I can be happy with only this man 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>After the snow and the rain 
<start>And the days of summer long, 
<start>And they heard the bird in the sky  
<start>The bird so long away. 
<start>They walked in the cold green shade, 
<start>And the leaves were falling slow, 
<start>And the stars were out of the sky 
<start>Under the summer sky. 
<start>God keep His angels strong! 
<start>God keep His angels bright! 
<start>God keep His angels true! 
<start>The blue of the sky was shining white, 
<start>To their way they went; 
<start>The white stars rose in the skies; 
<start>The white stars danced beside the stream, 
<start>But God kept His angels high! 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>Who had come to stay at home 
<start>Where her son was playing, 
<start>And she knew that their souls were in her little hands; 
<start>But she was sick of the little things that she had known and heard. 
<start>She asked if she could help her boy to come back to the house, 
<start>The way that they were going the long way about the street, 
<start>For they always had to go in their holes in the chimney and so did she: 
<start>It would be an endless journey that they never would come home again! 
<start>So she sat down to her work and answered, 
<start>As though her master had a little child in need, when he came into the house  
<start>And she sat down behind her a little while ago
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>And your soft smile to my rest. 
<start>The night wind is weary at sea  
<start>Its breath to the east is strong; 
<start>The rain has swept across the sea 
<start>As I passed it to repose. 
<start>The sky is clear and the sun is shining, 
<start>With a faint star on the sky. 
<start>As I stood upon the grassy floor, 
<start>I heard the soft winds blowing; 
<start>But soon my heart lay dead on my bed 
<start>And the stars passed by like a dream. 
<start>I dreamed that you were with me so long, 
<start>Your face upon my face, 
<start>And that your smile was clear and sweet, 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>As I think. 
<start>And on my cheeks the kisses burn, 
<start>Though all the dew is broken on their gleaming eyes; 
<start>How I seem to see you, when, in passing by, 
<start>They whisper, Oh, love is sweet. 
<start>And it will melt you into tears, 
<start>While all is still and calm; 
<start>And, oh! your love will ever warm 
<start>To memory all! 
<start>And it will bless and make you blushing-sweet, 
<start>And you'll dare 
<start>Your little ones to kiss the bright stars red 
<start>Where I'm lying. 
<start>'Twas on the night when down we came, 
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>As I would for the kisses of your hair. 
<start>Farewell, farewell, lovely lady; 
<start>And farewell to all my fears: 
<start>If you love my heart, thou shalt be kind; I 
<start>Loved you not, and have hated you, and I love thee. 
<start>Sweetheart, I love you far, and still 
<start>I look at thy face, and love thee more. 
<start>You smile on me and I laugh at your woe,  
<start>For I can bear no more the sighing of 
<start>The sorrow-laden wailing of a child, 
<start>Wherewith the world is made to be so lone; 
<start>And even on you I would smile and would sigh, 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>For the rest of the month, 
<start>For the moonlight was over the hill, 
<start>For the sun was still above the hill, 
<start>And nothing stirred in the house 
<start>They could see the stars. 
<start>At night they all went out to play, 
<start>At midnight from their beds they crept 
<start>To the old house in the wood, 
<start>Where sat old Wipunen slow 
<start>In his hammock at the foot. 
<start>There was no sound of alarm, 
<start>No sound of danger, save a squeak 
<start>Of small children running by, 
<start>For the moonlight was gone; 
<start>But a little dog barked loudly from the yard, 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And in love and in love. 
<start>And some had gold and worth: 
<start>Some held it up in pride; 
<start>When they took it, they were sad as death, 
<start>They were young and fierce. 
<start>Then went the Queen in her robes 
<start>And in her royal dress, 
<start>Her noble crest, her golden spurs 
<start>That shone like golden gold. 
<start>And some had blood: and some were rich, 
<start>With all the wealth of gold; 
<start>Some came from the realms of the wood and the air; 
<start>And some from the ocean did bring 
<start>From out of sea, or land. 
<start>And some some were old and of fair
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>The night that followed me and you. 
<start>Oh yes, if, by chance on some strange land, 
<start>A maiden wandered forth into the east, 
<start>Some little star had touched her eye and said: 
<start>'Give me back my love, love that you hold dear, 
<start>As well as I may, what I have loved so dear.' 
<start>Then it struck me, 'Hear me now, I pray, 
<start>As long as there is love in Heaven, O love, 
<start>As long as it may seem to me,' 
<start>And I bowed my head, and bowed my head too, 
<start>And took another starlit hand. 
<start>I sat and read the letters, looking forth, 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>A night long ago; 
<start>They sat, and they dreamed and they watched 
<start>The little light show by. 
<start>But the long day was come the night 
<start>Was come, it was coming late; 
<start>The sun had set the moonlight deep 
<start>And set the moonlight bright. 
<start>They could not catch a glimpse of it 
<start>But I watched it go; 
<start>And the moonlight seemed to be a gleam 
<start>Through the grass under the eaves; 
<start>Till the grass was wet with rain and wet; 
<start>And the rain looked down upon their faces blue; 
<start>And they all were lost in a dream. 
<start>I saw the sun go down
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>For the first time in some way to be, 
<start>If aught of which you ever read it, 
<start>Not because I can, in fancy, 
<start>Convey the sentiment it expresses, 
<start>But because you hold a greater store 
<start>When I write a piece in writing prose. 
<start>I was a poet early in life, 
<start>And for five years my prose-poems 
<start>Grew dull with every year; 
<start>And then one night I went to bed, 
<start>And, by the way, I heard 
<start>The song that sounded the worse for me 
<start>From the piano's note. 
<start>My voice grew softer and colder, 
<start>Until I
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>As the stars are, 
<start>But my song comes from afar, 
<start>There comes but one 
<start>Out of my song, 
<start>They are mad and in love, 
<start>I may not sing that night, 
<start>They're all mad and in love 
<start>As the stars are! 
<start>The sun shines not at night 
<start>The moon shines not at noon 
<start>The stars shine not at morn 
<start>They are mad to the core 
<start>But the song comes from afar, 
<start>There comes but one; 
<start>Sing in the hall 
<start>They are mad and in love 
<start>The moon shines not at dawn  
<start>The
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>That used to be your dearest friend; 
<start>For now my heart can hardly let 
<start>My thoughts go flying at your thought. 
<start>O! would I could be happy all day 
<start>As once I did in this most fit, 
<start>The last moments of the day, 
<start>Which none else can truly see or know; 
<start>The joy which others love to tell 
<start>Before I die or die a little. 
<start>And oft a star I wish to fill 
<start>With light and air and sun and breeze, 
<start>To-morrow and the third to me; 
<start>When all is still the world I love 
<start>With little rest between. 
<start>And often this
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>From the summer of life, 
<start>I long to hear you speak 
<start>Like a child's playmate, 
<start>As we come to-morrow. 
<start>O my heart, my heart and lips, 
<start>How the years went by, 
<start>How they came, as they flew about in the light of the day, 
<start>So sweetly, like a child's, 
<start>I long for you, sweet sister. 
<start>My heart, my heart and lips, 
<start>And my heart that is sad to the core, 
<start>My heart that is sweet to my heart and my lips to the core 
<start>Is too long to be free, I long for your smile on my face, 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>Who never spoke a word! 
<start>A long, long silence 
<start>O! I'm not alone. 
<start>All the little things I know 
<start>Are all too long. 
<start>It's good to stay awhile,  
<start>To stand and think, 
<start>Though everything you do, 
<start>May break and die. 
<start>The only things I think on 
<start>Are all of those things so long. 
<start>You may hear them with a smile, 
<start>But you have never seen anything. 
<start>Just what's a man to me 
<start>When life and his own dear name 
<start>Are all so changed? 
<start>If there's something to
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>No more, oh, no more! 
<start>You will stay at length, and take 
<start>My hand across your brow,  
<start>And kiss it, like a kiss, while I wait! 
<start>You have passed me now. 
<start>I will take no more your hand, 
<start>Or stay, for, when you come back, 
<start>I'll take your hand too, oh, not for you! 
<start>I will take no more your hands 
<start>From the cold lips of night; 
<start>You, too, will come back when I bring the kiss, 
<start>And kiss you with regret! 
<start>But I know you cannot come again!  And the world is all too sad to come; 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>And it must be so, 
<start>And it must be so 
<start>And it must be so! 
<start>'It's time on the green, 
<start>'That I come in, or walk by, 
<start>Or sit alone in the garden, 
<start>Or sit by the fire.' 
<start>'And will you send up the flag, 
<start>Your own, my brother?' 
<start>'It must be by the night, 
<start>'And you coming together here, 
<start>Your friends to all, to me to-day.' 
<start>'I shall,' quoth Miss Alice, 
<start>'I may go alone, I may go alone, 
<start>With your little red heart.' 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>Like little children at their play; 
<start>The night was long and dreary, 
<start>While all around the world 
<start>The mistletoe and scarlet wreath 
<start>Made music that no sound could frame. 
<start>And then the moon came up the morn 
<start>And, with soft and sudden glare, 
<start>Her lighted eyes on me were wide, 
<start>And, as the light began to fall, 
<start>The moon went down, and on her lips, 
<start>As down the grass of green grass on the wall, 
<start>The mistletoe softly lay. 
<start>And then the sun came up the morn 
<start>I passed away, 
<start>And, in my
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>Who were as poor a fellow as they! 
<start>Of the time of the year you are not 
<start>I know not how you did fare  
<start>Though he who did best to please me here, 
<start>May have been just a little too; 
<start>The same though, from your dear face, 
<start>You may have missed, as I am guessing, 
<start>Some small thing, my dear, perhaps, - 
<start>This is not a poem for the young, 
<start>Nor a poem for the old; 
<start>I had thought for long a child's play 
<start>As a youngster you would be, 
<start>But I thought of no one; none came near it 
<start>As I was near
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>As a tribute to poor humanity. 
<start>I would not do it like a child, I do not know the meaning of my 
<start>purpose to you. 
<start>I would not do it like a child, I do not know the worth of my 
<start>soul to you. 
<start>I feel I could tell you any day from day to day of your 
<start>heart if you did a thousand things wrong or nothing for one 
<start>another. 
<start>I would not do it like a child, I do not know where to begin a poem, I do not 
<start>know the power of your eyes. 
<start>I would not do it like a child, I do not see a vision of a goal, I do not know the 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>When you are dead, 
<start>And how for fear of having it, 
<start>I cannot tell: 
<start>But here at home with the rest  
<start>I really do miss you. 
<start>When first on earth I was a child, 
<start>I could not cry no more, 
<start>And all my thoughts about you 
<start>Went flying like flocks of bees. 
<start>All my days I was content to dream, 
<start>And every night I'd come back 
<start>To dreams like those around your eyes 
<start>When life was growing old. 
<start>Since then I've gone away to play and play, 
<start>And play and play until I'm tired, 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And how you've taken care of me! 
<start>Then I looked around and saw her hair 
<start>Hung, flaring, like a starlight in wind; 
<start>And saw a young girl with a black gown. 
<start>And in a hurry I went up stairs 
<start>And down the hall to the window-pane; 
<start>And here she stands before me, holding her head, 
<start>And sobbing low, I only think, my dear! 
<start>Look up, 'tis the light that seems to die. 
<start>Oh, mother dear, I'm so frightened I fear 
<start>My baby could die when I'd die. 
<start>So I said, We'll not do that again, dear, 
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>Through some odd and various things! 
<start>I know it doesn't mean much. 
<start>But I will say just that. 
<start>I didn't believe a little while it might come to our end; but now, 
<start>What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful thing! 
<start>I mean the very same thing, with just a single single line, 
<start>The thing called a poem! 
<start>I was a little older then I'm really very young and I'm about 
<start>Ten years and a half ago. 
<start>To see the world the old tree, with the trees on its branches; 
<start>The sea-bird and the bees, that sing at the window; 
<start>The little bird and the little moth; 
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>On my heart and on my brow. 
<start>I long for your beauty on each bough, 
<start>And its fragrant sweetness there; 
<start>I long for your glad words of love, 
<start>And the tender kisses they give: 
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile, 
<start>And the gladness the way gives 
<start>To my soul to go back again! 
<start>But your fair face has changed, my Heart, I say; 
<start>A cloud's the face of the future we see; 
<start>And now I know that it is ours to stand 
<start>Here, alone with your beautiful eyes. 
<start>I long to know if you will stay 
<start>Within these little walls,
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And your pretty face, O! 
<start>You'd have a heart like ours 
<start>That'll never let us go 
<start>Without it, if so you choose 
<start>To think it so. 
<start>I'd say to your life, O  
<start>This heart is kind to you, 
<start>While I could tell you how to do it, 
<start>And what to hope for  
<start>Just what to do if I could die here 
<start>From my own hand's weight! 
<start>I would die for you as you'd die, O  
<start>A day like this, 
<start>'And let your life be as you've lived in it 
<start>And not drown in it.
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>When you're looking back into my eyes! 
<start>You are turning back to me from the gloom 
<start>Of the long shadows in the city, as you may 
<start>For a time before you turn back again. 
<start>You are the one who stood through the storm; 
<start>It was dark and cold, and I am gone. 
<start>Your form is changed when I behold you go, 
<start>And you are standing up in a mist 
<start>Of darkness and you are gone from sight  
<start>You have passed me and come to a far land so 
<start>The world should have you lost yourself. 
<start>When I was sick and cold 
<start>The heart fell heavy when I had to lie down 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>Thinking of some small land 
<start>Mingled with those great plains. 
<start>They watched the stars go by, 
<start>They wondered what could come 
<start>To this desert place so well. 
<start>They watched a river lie 
<start>In the calm water clear, 
<start>I could see in her eyes 
<start>No moonbeam or star. 
<start>She was calm as ever 
<start>If only her breath slept  
<start>She had no care to dream. 
<start>A star was born, as bright,  
<start>She watched the stars go by, 
<start>But no moonbeam or star. 
<start>She turned to the west, 
<start>And heard the waves
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>For which you've done it, to give you new ease 
<start>To think it's a poem of which the world is blind. 
<start>Then I began: 
<start>O, it's a work of beauty too, 
<start>Some one has made it, we shall see it all. 
<start>And my heart was not at rest 
<start>When I was first to write for her  
<start>For she's the woman we all are, 
<start>She's the woman who does not lie. 
<start>To keep me from myself 
<start>This is not poetry done. 
<start>I could find but one, 
<start>What's a rhyme of yours, 
<start>But one of hers? 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>When they came to the door. 
<start>And oh, let us think as we walk 
<start>In the forest through the gray, 
<start>While we walk into the wooded lane, 
<start>And all the wild summer is gone, 
<start>And the wind's note is broken, 
<start>And the sky is blue and white, 
<start>In the forest where the linnets grow, 
<start>And the brown leaves fall to weep. 
<start>No! when she sleeps, a dreamy dream 
<start>Is about to die away, 
<start>I have a strange delight in her bright eyes, 
<start>And a strange dread of death upon me. 
<start>The trees and their young branches are 
<start>The de
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>When I rode there was the light of our light 
<start>Through their houses a thousand miles a day, 
<start>And I rode out a thousand miles a day 
<start>And we stopped at each light that we rode in. 
<start>And through all the streets of the town, 
<start>So far and away, 
<start>That the day when I rode away 
<start>To the house where I hung at last. 
<start>Then to one side we rode 
<start>And the house we chose 
<start>Was made of all gold and bronze and gold and bronze, 
<start>And they sang their song, and so did we, 
<start>And they talked to us, and so did we. 
<start>And while we laughed from the road on
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>And many were slain, 
<start>And many a man their lives they saved. 
<start>Some had been made prisoners 
<start>To the sad and dreary West, 
<start>But few were found behind them. 
<start>Some had been killed in battle 
<start>But few were caught and buried. 
<start>And some had been spared the grave, 
<start>But few were found behind them. 
<start>Some from the land had trod it 
<start>On the mountains side, 
<start>But few were taken with the dead, 
<start>And few returned again; 
<start>All but one lay on the cold sod 
<start>And one went forth to rest. 
<start>And in the evening the Lord went forth 
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>That makes me think of my dear one's grave, 
<start>The olden, olden, olden days 
<start>In my sweet baby's grave! 
<start>And he whispered a sweet prayer, and he said, 
<start>O God forgive the mother that has lost my boy, 
<start>Who made him to go to Christ as a child: 
<start>O God forgive the mother that cannot part, 
<start>If she has lost my little boy! 
<start>O blessed be it if ye will, my boy! 
<start>And then they were wed, but ne'er a wink was seen. 
<start>They were wed; but ne'er a wink was seen I knew. 
<start>As we walked into the wood and down the street 
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>When I hear your feet on the ground. 
<start>'T is but the sweet and the pleasant hours 
<start>That are no longer our life's desire! 
<start>When God has made us the flowers of spring, 
<start>When earth is like a green and fair field, 
<start>'T is but the sweet and the pleasant hours 
<start>That are no longer our life's desire! 
<start>It is the song of the bird 
<start>Whose breath is as the breeze 
<start>Where, far apart, the lily-paw 
<start>In every leaf is seen. 
<start>When I close my eyes 
<start>To music and to light, 
<start>I think of your face and hear you come and play
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>When the day came. 
<start>The wind had a heavy sound 
<start>That startled the darkness away: 
<start>The white sun grew dim, the clouds went by and sighed, 
<start>I will go out to sea. 
<start>They were silent!  I did not heed, 
<start>That the water dripped, that the storm went by, 
<start>And all men was alone 
<start>That day.   'T is not to my ear that I hear 
<start>The sound of the wind when he is gone to sea! 
<start>The grass grows yellow on the hill, 
<start>The flowers close on the brake, 
<start>And the wind is a-calling, and I keep my watch 
<start>But he is not
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>And the air of your kiss   
<start>All the love you gave me 
<start>Hid the memory of us. 
<start>The world's the sum for you; 
<start>The world's the sum for me. 
<start>The world's the sum for you; 
<start>The world's the sum for me. 
<start>You're never tired of me   
<start>You know I am here: 
<start>I love you for all you do, 
<start>To give me the pleasure of 
<start>To live with you in my arms. 
<start>For you in this world are one: 
<start>I cannot be there to-day: 
<start>We only hold your hand. 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>With such an earnest look, 
<start>And what a woman looks like! 
<start>When I am young I always love you all 
<start>I know no more about you than this 
<start>I guess you were in the picture.  You 
<start>Are old and pale! Oh, no, I won't tell 
<start>The whole story out: 
<start>For I don't know a woman with such a head  
<start>And you are not your own! 
<start>You look great as any boy 
<start>And I wonder if you've a wife or two, 
<start>Or a brother, dear! 
<start>But all eyes are on you, dear, 
<start>And so still   
<start>I
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>Their souls were filled with fears, 
<start>Their thoughts were so full 
<start>They made them sad as is 
<start>The earth that covers them now. 
<start>And now in the night 
<start>When they sleep and rest, 
<start>Now is the day to depart 
<start>They lie and rest. 
<start>And soon the sky is gray 
<start>To see with the weary sun 
<start>Their heavy bodies laid. 
<start>They do not hear nor hear 
<start>When out the sea they lie. 
<start>The night is dark and still, 
<start>The night may come again; 
<start>And they that wait their sinner, 
<start>May their hearts be free. 
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>And our embrace in the sun. 
<start>I long for to meet you again! 
<start>I long for the sunshine of your eyes, 
<start>And the touch of your hands, 
<start>But at last no one shall ever clasp me, 
<start>On this quiet spot  
<start>I wish I were a little boy, 
<start>But what else am I? 
<start>And, after the long time of absence, I shall come home to my 
<start>mother 
<start>And hold you by the hand, and kiss you. 
<start>And the air is sweeter than the earth's cool and serene; 
<start>And the moonlit air is sweeter than the sea. 
<start>And the music of your voice
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>Since you came all your life; 
<start>For me, you did not have 
<start>The joy and strength that you must need; 
<start>My heart is like a lover's nest 
<start>Where you do not need to go! 
<start>What could I do to tell you all, 
<start>If you only knew! 
<start>And oh, no, no, 
<start>You would not dream, I know, of things 
<start>We thought in those dear years; 
<start>Of love and freedom which you knew; 
<start>And yet you have not known. 
<start>Yet still I can rejoice to think, 
<start>And love you still: 
<start>Your love is as a child, no doubt,
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>I have no faith in you now. 
<start>The fire that's there, and the fire all burnt-out! 
<start>I have to look for you there yet. 
<start>The candle lights up! Ah, God! I am dead! 
<start>The door is wide enough for me 
<start>And I should wish in vain for you, dear, 
<start>And have no faith in you now. 
<start>'Tis time for them to stand on the other side; 
<start>I know there must be things out on the floor, 
<start>And that I know there must be something to be done. 
<start>Come back! Oh, come back! You mustn't wait so long! 
<start>They're all mad. They're all
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>In their hearts. 
<start>And as the sun 
<start>Glares from the west-wind, 
<start>The dark night's face 
<start>Looks in their eyes, 
<start>As from its bosom, 
<start>And as all their eyes, 
<start>Each the other see. 
<start>What a scene it is! 
<start>What a light it is! 
<start>See! the sun, 
<start>And the blue moon, 
<start>And the day-time, 
<start>Gliding through air 
<start>As the moon with light, 
<start>Touches it; so leaps high. 
<start>There the stars, 
<start>Luminous and clear, 
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>For I did like her best. He must not have it 
<start>When he came back to me: a long time after 
<start>I returned from Florence he had not a name. 
<start>Though I remember, it was so long ago, 
<start>He was gone about the world, yet my soul 
<start>Was still very fond of him. For I saw him 
<start>At the close of a book-day, when the children 
<start>Would sit at the window and think of this boy. 
<start>He would sit down and listen to the people, 
<start>Watch them passing by while I told them everything 
<start>About one day and then a third morning.  My heart 
<start>Had broken out as I looked out of the window 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>And that's all the blame they knew, 
<start>And the same old old faces were. 
<start>There was an old woman 
<start>Who used to walk the streets 
<start>With nothing but her clay, 
<start>And never had a friend, 
<start>And never had her share. 
<start>She told her story 
<start>With laughter and sighs  
<start>Oh, the days so pleasant, 
<start>That I think of days like these 
<start>When the moon shone fair, and so 
<start>That I think of nights like these 
<start>When the moon shone low. 
<start>At nights like these I knew not why, 
<start>But I knew that, 
<start>Till my
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>That was a child  
<start>The stars are shining in the sun. 
<start>Why do you weep till I die? 
<start>The stars are shining in the sun. 
<start>Why do you weep until I die? 
<start>The stars are shining in the sun. 
<start>Why do you weep till I die? 
<start>The stars are shining in the sun. 
<start>Your tears have fled, and now my days 
<start>Are not so strange 
<start>As they are now. What have I done for you, 
<start>To come and walk with you there? 
<start>Do you know I am so poor, your tears have fled, 
<start>You never told me where, 
<start>My father
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>As I was weaving yesterday. 
<start>A child's love hath no power to quell, 
<start>All grief has a power to blind. 
<start>Your passion is a child's prayer; 
<start>I see it for my own. 
<start>The child must have her own sweet rest, 
<start>Because God gives her rest: 
<start>For I the child will have at morn, 
<start>For the man will sleep long night. 
<start>The child's love hath no power to quell, 
<start>All grief has a power to blind. 
<start>A child's love hath no power to quell 
<start>All gloom that it may wear, 
<start>And the love has no power to quell the tears
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>And the warmth of your kiss; 
<start>For it is a mystery to me, 
<start>It is a mystery to you. 
<start>Your arms are round me round the tree; 
<start>And you are a rose-white, white flower; 
<start>And all your blossoms that I touch 
<start>Are your tears, I will say; 
<start>And your heart is as the sky, 
<start>I will say, all love that I can; 
<start>And your mouth is so white and soft, 
<start>I will say, you are sweet as dew; 
<start>And your foot is so light yet still 
<start>I will say, Love's heart is hard to-day; 
<start>For you are
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>When we were not alone; 
<start>Then the day shall depart or go, 
<start>And the years be brief. 
<start>From Mallowcroft: The Mallowcroft Home Page 1 
<start>When love is kind, my heart I love, 
<start>For the warm sunny hand that caresses 
<start>My face is so fair, and soft. 
<start>I will not be the lover of thee, 
<start>Nor be my heart to thee; 
<start>Love is such a thing that seems the least 
<start>As it never was. 
<start>My love to you is so strong and true, 
<start>Because it loves me so  
<start>I know that this can never be. 
<start>I know
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>With the feeling I have of some of the scenes 
<start>Where the white man is singing, and the green man sings! 
<start>The white man, who is dancing 
<start>In the woods, 
<start>Oft in his singing 
<start>Told us of love  
<start>Oft of friendship's tears  
<start>Of kisses made to-day! 
<start>We have lost our hearts, 
<start>Are but a dust, 
<start>And no more of our love, 
<start>But a broken memory. 
<start>We have flown across the river 
<start>To the beautiful blue-bells of the river  
<start>Tiny blue-bells of our childhood come home  
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>Ere their first morning! 
<start>The wind has broken 
<start>The roof and window and bough, 
<start>And 
<start>The moon has been looking over the shore; 
<start>She sees them go. 
<start>They are not coming to rest; 
<start>She watches the sea; 
<start>She can hear what men are saying. 
<start>The sun is shining in the west. 
<start>They lie there with their faces up in the sky; 
<start>They will not go home. 
<start>They are the people only; 
<start>They are the people of the sea. 
<start>They are the people of the far-off clime. 
<start>And far away 
<start>We
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>And your smile all my days  
<start>Of the cold and you, you have been such a friend, 
<start>I'd be half so happy I would sigh for you: 
<start>Yet, for an hour, and the hours, and the hours 
<start>And the joys that pass, 
<start>I can never hope to be no more dear! 
<start>I would not be afraid of your kiss, 
<start>Your heart in my arms; 
<start>I'd be so sorry for that kiss once a year 
<start>And be glad for this! 
<start>I would not have you smile upon me when you kissed me, 
<start>I have loved you and your ways 
<start>And kissed you so, for the night 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>When we were young, and now they are out in the West, 
<start>To seek their sweet native land, 
<start>Wherein our days are few; 
<start>And our love is all forgot 
<start>As we go singing in the Summer sun. 
<start>So, in the West the wild winds blow away, 
<start>All the pleasant woods rejoice, 
<start>So that neither wind nor blast can harm nor rend, 
<start>But the wild winds go away. 
<start>So when the Spring comes round again, 
<start>And the Summer comes with many new flowers to see, 
<start>From the land of the braves 
<start>There will still be many a pleasant thing within, 
<start>To love and keep away, 
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>Whom my breast has loved so long. 
<start>He who, in dreams, has learned to pray 
<start>For all men's tears of sorrow, 
<start>Who can learn to read a human sigh 
<start>With a glance that says to me: 
<start>Ah, love is the strength of man's mind; 
<start>Love has power to change the world, 
<start>And the last hope of all human love 
<start>Must be the strength of the whole of the whole world. 
<start>I have looked for thee once, I have looked  
<start>For thy face, too well I see the light! 
<start>I have loved thee long, I shall not forget thee, 
<start>Lorenzo, 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And the old gray men and the war! 
<start>When the red soldiers come in, 
<start>I stand here in the morning. 
<start>You come! We'll fight, I'll fight! 
<start>Back again in peace, old comrade, 
<start>A year, I think, has gone, 
<start>While we are fighting to-day 
<start>The old dead man and the gray gray men! 
<start>When the red soldiers come in, 
<start>I stand here in the morning. 
<start>O the love that is in your heart 
<start>Is a joy to see when 
<start>We are fighting to-day 
<start>And a war to-night 
<start>With the red men and the war
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>As much as any poor man could care for; and yet 
<start>I wish it were as little of the poet 
<start>As all he has written, for whose sake he 
<start>I would not change it to a song, while I 
<start>Have been a poet with the poet's self 
<start>And the soul's most passionate feeling, and, like him, 
<start>Have been a poet with a father's heart. 
<start>For in all human things one's only friend 
<start>With what the mind can give, and what the eye can give, 
<start>If that it can make him all things to adore, 
<start>Not to be loved without love in his own life, 
<start>He will not love me. 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>Until she gave them up, 
<start>And they were in love with me, 
<start>And now they do not know us; 
<start>And oh, why must they 
<start>Keep them so near one another? 
<start>And I, as though they knew none 
<start>Who loved, yet had no fear of us, 
<start>As though they knew nothing, 
<start>As though they knew nothing, 
<start>Lest one be ever near us; 
<start>And I, as though the dead alone 
<start>Were living, 
<start>And all should see and comprehend us, 
<start>And find out 
<start>That love is love! 
<start>Then they said: Oh! it could not be, 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And all the sweet love-time,  
<start>Oh, who, no doubt, would know the meaning 
<start>Of my vow  
<start>But that there is no love! 
<start>Oh, may each heart-fraught lover 
<start>Come in his lonely mood;  
<start>Oh, let the sweet love-time, 
<start>While it lasts, come through his hair! 
<start>Dear eyes, dear lips, dear lips, 
<start>How could I make you live! 
<start>Ah, no, no, that will not go; 
<start>Nor death will come to fill it. 
<start>But love still must live! 
<start>Ah me I cannot die! 
<start>You live forever
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And of your pain that is mine: 
<start>O let it be 
<start>All over. 
<start>With the lily white and green 
<start>Lift you your white hands o'er me: 
<start>You are the first to fall 
<start>Like hail from the mountain-high! 
<start>O, be it so, 
<start>I wait for the soft kiss of you. 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you, 
<start>For the lily white and green 
<start>Lift you your white hands o'er me, 
<start>And look to the skies all blue, 
<start>I love you more than skies can say. 
<start>O let it be 
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>By the old moonlight, and will keep 
<start>It as ever and always white 
<start>Without the least suggestion of weariness, 
<start>Or of care.  Now, take me out to the garden, 
<start>In its early summer weather; 
<start>I will walk alone, without thinking of you. 
<start>Not a word of the music you sing in your garden, 
<start>Not a voice, it seems, calling to you; 
<start>Not a sound of singing, but the sound of the summer bird, 
<start>Calling me to take you away. 
<start>With you comes my heart to my heart's core! 
<start>Let us walk together, and never leave me apart,  
<start>Swaying, and
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>Of living where my heart was young. 
<start>What is this world that holds the star-lit face 
<start>Of my sweetheart in its bosom like a dream, 
<start>To soothe and keep her, like a ghost within 
<start>The twilight of her eyelids and soothe for me, 
<start>And soothe her in the silent, shadowed air? 
<start>I, who am but a ghost, a child of time 
<start>The sun hath made a god and I too am old. 
<start>The hours of darkness fall upon the plain; 
<start>The moon begins her bright career; 
<start>The morning falls again; 
<start>The dawn is born again. 
<start>What now? 
<start>What is the
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>Before you know it! 
<start>Yes, it is indeed more fine than any 
<start>That I have seen anywhere in the world. 
<start>Oh, come, 
<start>I'll listen, and I will read it with a sigh. 
<start>How, with each careless step in the sun, 
<start>The long-dried bumblebee in the spring 
<start>Lit on one bough from the sun, 
<start>Lit on one leaf, 
<start>And to the grass of the stubble he springs. 
<start>Oh, the leaf-strewn meadows are green, 
<start>The moss-grown fields are green, 
<start>And the leaves are thick with the blossoms, 
<start>And the
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>That must be long, 
<start>I had no time to compose it: now 
<start>My soul is filled with sorrow, and I see 
<start>That sadness is far too great a weight. To-day 
<start>We mourn him who has gone away, 
<start>The one I loved a thousand years ago 
<start>That may be passed away. Ah, my soul 
<start>Must tremble at my memory, must feel 
<start>That life is but for one who has been blind 
<start>Ever in the eyes of men. May he, dear soul, 
<start>Still look unto his grave! Thee in mine, 
<start>Who can but say, This is too much of him? 
<start>Forgive him, forgive. 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And still the other one was fair. 
<start>A merry spring in all her flowery lay, 
<start>The summer's golden crown, 
<start>A fairy fair, with a flowery head and green eyes 
<start>In the garden's dimness, 
<start>I was sitting, for once and twice and thrice 
<start>When Robin and Mary came by. 
<start>And they looked upon my little face, 
<start>And they loved me still; and every time I met 
<start>My love was more sweet than their loves before: 
<start>For every word they say, 
<start>It had enchanted them, 
<start>And I told them I loved them all the while. 
<start>How dear they be!  I could scarcely have
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>All in my head.  The sun is rising, 
<start>And the flowers are blooming again. 
<start>In my garden now I see its light 
<start>Gleaming in the sunlight on the rose, 
<start>And I wonder if there is fragrance. 
<start>There I sit and smell the grasses, 
<start>And the flowers are fresh and sweet; 
<start>I know that they are growing to flowers, 
<start>And that I know their fragrant fragrance. 
<start>But that is how it was begun, my friend, 
<start>And how it lingered with me too. 
<start>I heard it say, if the summer sunshine 
<start>Had not come from the east the more, 
<start>But the
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>When he told them to say: 
<start>So here we have to dwell. 
<start>I know the place when the flowers are bare, 
<start>And the air is damp 
<start>Against the day, when the children are no more, 
<start>But, in summer-time, when the sun on his hat 
<start>Is not so bright. 
<start>I have no memory of them; but do I care? 
<start>Of you I'm certain  
<start>That they were true. 
<start>He who had them, has but two left? 
<start>They have gone out of sight. 
<start>You never thought of them? 
<start>No; not one, who, on the threshold of the house, you have seen,
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>But when you read it you should look 
<start>For the great words that I could write. 
<start>No, the songs I have been reading 
<start>The great things that I never knew, 
<start>The little things that never made 
<start>The great things that I never knew. 
<start>For all of my love, my heart, 
<start>For all I loved and wished to leave 
<start>To be loved again in the dust, 
<start>I am dying, dying my death. 
<start>No, not for the poor, who live alone, 
<start>Or to be gone, but with the dead, 
<start>For whom there is no rest for the dead, 
<start>No peace on earth or the grave. 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>They were a-walking, 
<start>For neither horse nor cot; 
<start>But there was never a word 
<start>In that old tongue before. 
<start>Bewildering the little bird, 
<start>They were quite happy and gay 
<start>Beneath the tree, 
<start>But that little maiden 
<start>Went to the old tree. 
<start>All three were singing together 
<start>In a dream; 
<start>Boys, sing now! sing now! 
<start>All three were merry and gay: 
<start>They were very merry and gay. 
<start>They bade the cuckoo sing, 
<start>And bade the cricket sing 
<start>Boys, sing
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>The first time they were born. 
<start>A little baby was born; 
<start>He was beautiful and good, 
<start>The baby with its eyes of gold 
<start>Drawn through the white of night: 
<start>There was a little child before 
<start>It was born, and it grew like me, 
<start>And there was sorrow in my heart 
<start>When it was little child. 
<start>For I had to give my child 
<start>A little kiss if she was fair  
<start>But he was not my child at all, 
<start>And I did so little love him. 
<start>I could not touch him, for I knew 
<start>That I should never get by 
<start>With lips that
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>That love me so well. The first part 
<start>Of my heart is yours, you know. 
<start>So, you and I together 
<start>Will meet and pass again 
<start>Along the road together 
<start>With the joy I have known. 
<start>When will I meet again, 
<start>And your heart be so gay 
<start>As to sing with love? We will go  
<start>Will go through the snow 
<start>By the forest's green side and the brook 
<start>And the river  
<start>To where once in old ages 
<start>The old church stood. 
<start>When will the world forget you? 
<start>And shall the world forget me? 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And how I feel in my sleep! 
<start>How my white hands feel the dew 
<start>And my white eyes glow with the sun 
<start>In warm love-sick passion still. 
<start>How, as I sing and love, my lips 
<start>Are drawn to the words that I cannot tell  
<start>Words that I never loved before, of all. 
<start>You may not say you cannot. 
<start>I must be true to her that I am. 
<start>Oh, how I love! how I love! 
<start>My heart aches like singing a song 
<start>Of one who has loved you then! 
<start>No longer will I break your spell 
<start>Of passion, my dear, 
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>Where my babe grows, and I long for a kiss of your heart. 
<start>Sweet child, he said, it is my child, I have no joy no sorrow 
<start>I shall never be but a little babe again. 
<start>Then the child was gone, the mother answered, 
<start>And the father answered, It has been a long time ago. 
<start>He answered, Is it not time? I am thinking about it. 
<start>But the mother said, Is it not time? 
<start>He answered gently, O my child, a month ago; 
<start>He shall grow as well as I desire; 
<start>O no! my child, he shall never be but a little babe again. 
<start>What care you? He will grow as well
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>And you can hear him in the sea 
<start>With his lips softening and his hands 
<start>Eying me out of sight. 
<start>O heart of the seas, you know the ways 
<start>To keep away from me. 
<start>Oh, what a thrill you've had when you met 
<start>With her smile so strong! 
<start>You've been so wise the days you used 
<start>To watch the sunrise shine. 
<start>She is your love and your heart, your eyes, 
<start>Just like your soul. 
<start>But I hold you for her, and you hold me 
<start>When you talk so strange! 
<start>Tiny and fair as she is, and you laugh, 
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>In the soft sunshine of your smile; 
<start>A bright, transparent light, 
<start>That the bright sun never dies; 
<start>A light that the night cannot see, 
<start>As the sun is lost in the light; 
<start>A sound that the night cannot hear, 
<start>As the winds must bear it away 
<start>From my lips to my heart, 
<start>The love or the love of the rain. 
<start>But I cannot love my love of you! 
<start>It is not love that it draws from you; 
<start>The heart beats in it all the same; 
<start>The wind is all in it, and the sky is gray. 
<start>And you, the love that it draws from you
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>Of the golden sun; 
<start>But when she came in 
<start>To the sea-shore's verge, 
<start>They heard her cry, 
<start>Love, love the sea! 
<start>I loved the moon in her eclipse: 
<start>It was so fair of light: 
<start>And I loved her on the green-wood tree: 
<start>That day was the day on the hills of Leven: 
<start>But when she came in 
<start>They heard her cry, 
<start>Love, love the sea! 
<start>It was so fair of light - 
<start>It was so fair of light and she was dead: 
<start>But in Leven we heard her cry, 
<start>Love,
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>As you are reading. 
<start>In the night I watched with fear, 
<start>The shadows fell and died. 
<start>I dreamt I saw you at my heart 
<start>The great lights glimmered through. 
<start>And I lay on your couch beside me 
<start>For a long moment, watching 
<start>Your face, with its starlike flush, 
<start>And it seemed you had a place. 
<start>And I kissed your eyelids again, 
<start>And as you went out to a fire 
<start>Were the flames red-hot and red-hot. 
<start>And I heard the red lips of the angels 
<start>Call and sing and answer my prayers, 
<start>And the fire was
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>And I said, It's all best once more. 
<start>I don't know how to tell you all. 
<start>You're much older than I was when we met, 
<start>He said, then laughed outright at my excuse in my face. 
<start>My boy!... but I was one of the first to say 
<start>That you'd somehow found one of us, so, you know. 
<start>... He kissed his daughter, and she was a tearful thing: 
<start>'Well, little girl, you know I hate to speak of it; 
<start>I've seen how much you've suffered as a bride or mother. 
<start>But you know I hate her, too. I hate to call you naught, 
<start>But just to speak: 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And so they met 
<start>In the dance of the dead tree 
<start>That in its shade grew so. 
<start>And one was a lover, 
<start>The other a bride; 
<start>And one was a lady gay, 
<start>To whom she had a lover. 
<start>They sang two loves of the night sky, 
<start>And one was a maid, 
<start>And the other a fair maid, 
<start>A fair maid to me, to a maid. 
<start>And the maid replied 
<start>To them, Well can I say, 
<start>Thou art fair in a lover's sight, 
<start>As in a fairy's dream. 
<start>And the maiden replied: Oh, well
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>Who never saw your face again, 
<start>And how you had such a lovely look 
<start>At one so lovely and so fair! 
<start>In one look I had my love to please, 
<start>And in my hands I could forget; 
<start>But still I felt a longing warm 
<start>To feel the fingers gently press 
<start>Your beautiful arms and fingers near, 
<start>As if they held the gentle hand. 
<start>You were my heart's lover for aye, 
<start>When this wild beauty I could prove 
<start>And this fair beauty held him fast. 
<start>So let the cruel heart do all 
<start>To hold you in its own  
<start>But in that lovely bosom lay
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>A while and then there was none was so bold as me. 
<start>'Tis true that the king must get them, 
<start>'Tis true, dear lord, 
<start>So fast I hate them 
<start>A moment and turn away. 
<start>For you in this case 
<start>Are but too young! 
<start>Oh, your good and noble father, 
<start>I would your fate so die; 
<start>But your name is but on my page, 
<start>It is but shame to die, 
<start>For you do not care. 
<start>If you do love me now 
<start>They will surely be mad in your mind, 
<start>It is just a pity to die. 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>When I first saw you last 
<start>The dearest of my friends, 
<start>And all of them were happy 
<start>When I first met you, 
<start>And all they cared for 
<start>Was their old faces, 
<start>And their hearts that filled 
<start>With joy to think you loved them. 
<start>I'll give you but a single 
<start>Light of my soul 
<start>The charm of the morning, 
<start>The charm of the first sun, 
<start>And of the second. 
<start>And I'll give you this, sweetheart, 
<start>The charm of the third sun, 
<start>And of the fourth sun 
<start>And of the fifth sun, 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>When they knew that their love was dead, 
<start>When they knew that the King died, 
<start>And every night the sun sat down. 
<start>In the dark of the night, 
<start>When the darkness comes on the door, 
<start>They cried, O Lord that it be free, 
<start>There is no one near, 
<start>There is not one on foot, 
<start>And the little ones said I can make a man! 
<start>Lord, why do I lie down here on yonder bed, 
<start>And never a starlight shining on me more? 
<start>Why do I dream so fast, 
<start>Ah, Lord, I pray, as if one thing could make me faint, 
<start>All my
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And of the little girl I used to love. 
<start>I'm sure she'd never understand 
<start>The beauty of a face so bright, 
<start>The beauty of her smiling eyes, 
<start>If only I could see her once 
<start>For who shall be my love I guess. 
<start>I hope to see her smile no less! 
<start>Not till the long day has gone 
<start>And the very sun has gone and gone 
<start>Can she hear the lark sing still and still, 
<start>When evening comes along the bough; 
<start>And oh, with some soft and gentle touch, 
<start>I'll whisper out my sweet refrain; 
<start>But where is the young one now I see 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>Of their daily labour. 
<start>In a little window there they sat 
<start>The very birds flew in; 
<start>And soon they knew the summer sun 
<start>Was shining through. 
<start>And from every window flew 
<start>Tinkling and skipping, 
<start>Tingling and skipping and skipping 
<start>The birds sang and blushed. 
<start>Then they flew to the garden fair, 
<start>And, as they flew, 
<start>Their hearts beat as they sang and blushed, 
<start>And the little birds played happily, 
<start>And the little birds played together. 
<start>And through the window on the ground 
<start>The little birds lay, 
<start>And a white bird
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>Because it is not what it was. 
<start>Himself I will give to you still 
<start>In this case, as he will do, 
<start>Than all that he will give to you this day. 
<start>Your own hand of mine, my dear, 
<start>Is a very good one, 
<start>And I will work him all I can 
<start>Who would enjoy it still. 
<start>You have said that for a hundred years, 
<start>In this one case, I would not die! 
<start>I am not a man for love's sake  
<start>I am, perhaps, too clever; 
<start>Of your heart let me go. 
<start>But, after all, it is a dream
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>Because it is written to myself: 
<start>If any, I'm most sorry for them, 
<start>To be in a place I never knew, 
<start>Which the greatest people never knew, 
<start>'Twere most shocking to think I felt it. 
<start>But some of you have asked in vain  
<start>I am thinking you may get through. 
<start>But my little wife has said to me, 
<start>I am quite sure she will believe me. 
<start>She said to me, I have done well; 
<start>For I have finished what she told me; 
<start>Why should I fear? or shall I blame her 
<start>Because I don't believe? 
<start>I am thinking of her still
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And how sweet you were last winter! 
<start>I wish that the sun on your face 
<start>Had no shadow on the ground  
<start>But it surely may shine for you, 
<start>And never be dimmed by a smile  
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you. 
<start>It will never be the last time to miss you; 
<start>Though you seem so young, we have our place 
<start>When you lie by the road to be true. 
<start>This is the way your mother calls you  
<start>To let us sit by her side 
<start>And see if she'll be coming home, I ween; 
<start>And it is time for us to part. 
<start>So we
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>To lie beside you, sweet, in bed. 
<start>Oh! I'd like to see you sitting there 
<start>And playing alone like that old child, 
<start>And lying on you all day long 
<start>In a crib like this. 
<start>How sweet to rest with you and me 
<start>Over the past, 
<start>O! how dear to let your little feet 
<start>Play at the piano as we lay 
<start>Here on the floor! 
<start>How sweet the dreams you weave within you - 
<start>The visions that are all our own  
<start>Oh oh, how dear to think of you, 
<start>When you sit here and play so alone -  
<start>Oh, how sweet
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>Just thinking of you - 
<start>And how, ah, how can I forget you? 
<start>Why, that's your lot! 
<start>The sun, like his own mother, 
<start>Hath brought me to the earth; 
<start>And through the open meads and wilds 
<start>Of my own dear home, it has taught me 
<start>All this, dear Mary. 
<start>I have a little girl 
<start>That I have left with me. 
<start>She is tall, and has seven toes; 
<start>She is tall, and has a nose like mine; 
<start>When she goes out on the ground 
<start>She is very pretty, too. 
<start>She has black eyes,
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>At the thought of her,  
<start>Like they were mad and in love! 
<start>That is right! 
<start>Then I started up 
<start>And spake to her again; 
<start>I was not glad I was glad that she was there. I just 
<start>Forgot that her love was good. 
<start>She said. 
<start>When I sat by her chair 
<start>I saw her smile and nod: 
<start>I took the old white book in my hands once more, and said:  
<start>Ah, God! yes! I was glad that I was there! 
<start>It's just as sweet as it was yesterday. 
<start>She took that old white book in her hands, and said, 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>So fair and gay and old. 
<start>I only think it does me good 
<start>To be you in the skies, 
<start>Till you shall have the world, my love, 
<start>And I shall have you all. 
<start>I only wish that you were there, 
<start>Not to make out the sky  
<start>To be the earth before you die,  
<start>Where the stars do sit their night! 
<start>The bright stars are there, but they are old; 
<start>So shall ye ne'er be born anew 
<start>Till the world is old again. 
<start>I only wish, that you were there, 
<start>To live with me again  
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And yet some would say; The night was dark: 
<start>The night was cruel! 
<start>They had come down into a land 
<start>Where the sky was heavy with stars, 
<start>And the winds made the clouds to be 
<start>So dark that there was little light; 
<start>They rode to a house far away, 
<start>With an apple in their hand. 
<start>They were mad and in love 
<start>And they had not a word to say, 
<start>As they had been born to love and die 
<start>Of a sickness of night. 
<start>Yet the sky was full of angels, 
<start>And the trees looked with their branches white; 
<start>And the sky was bright and beautiful,
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And thinking of my hair. 
<start>I have taken to the woods with a longing to be near you 
<start>But what are we going to do 
<start>I do not care for the weather. 
<start>And I come to the woods as I go with a longing to be near you 
<start>When the day is cold I know not what, 
<start>And a woman's voice has spoken. 
<start>I am weary, and I find no rest; 
<start>The long grass is stilled  
<start>There is nothing of peace but the grave where your grave will be  
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you. 
<start>To think that the spring is over is over is a strange and a wonderful feeling, 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>In the cold night. 
<start>In the wild storm and the long night 
<start>The birds would say to the wind, 
<start>Oh, little birds, do not bark, 
<start>For I will follow you home. 
<start>The woods lay in the moonlight: 
<start>The wind tossed up its leaves; 
<start>The boughs of the rose-leafed meads 
<start>Were wet with the red dawn's breath. 
<start>I heard in the fields of life 
<start>A woman cry, Ah, beautiful child, 
<start>Go out, ye little birds, in quest of me! 
<start>Go out to the meadows and woodlands, 
<start>To seek my kindred. 
<start>She came
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>As they fled, to the north-west. 
<start>They were fain at the end of the road 
<start>To ride up till they come. 
<start>They were fain to be in the sun-dew, 
<start>But not in the wind: 
<start>They were fain at the end of the road 
<start>Into the spring again. 
<start>They were fain to be in the sunlight, 
<start>Into the mist. 
<start>They were fevered and fain at the end of the road 
<start>To ride up till they come. 
<start>Oh, never can I come where the roses fall 
<start>And the green are the roses, 
<start>The summer-blossoms sweet and sweet
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>Wept for that long lost one, 
<start>And wept to meet them on Easter day. 
<start>There was a woman, I ween, 
<start>Who wore a red, red cross-bow, 
<start>A bright red bow, a scarlet bow, 
<start>That she, as she passed beside, 
<start>With white hands and feet did stand; 
<start>White as the snow on the mountains, 
<start>The red-roofed arrow, she; 
<start>The white-roofed deer, that she did bring; 
<start>White or black, this day; 
<start>She bore me the bow and the cross to God. 
<start>And I was a virgin, too! 
<start>And she
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>The day of the fight.  And now I am tired, 
<start>The more I look upon you, the more I feel 
<start>A feverish hunger for the story of the slain. 
<start>But I am thinking of the dead men I know of, 
<start>Saw them not coming at the call of the day, 
<start>Or ere the fire of the battle-night had set. 
<start>With that I lifted my head, and wept aloud; 
<start>But soon the tears came back over my tears like rain, 
<start>And to my heart I cried:  My friends, my mother and my brothers! 
<start>My brother dear are gone; and you, my wife dear, are dead, 
<start>Dead to-day! 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And your eyes with tears, not me. 
<start>And when I close to you, 
<start>My heart's aching quite. 
<start>Yet in a moment I'll go on 
<start>To visit you again. 
<start>Though the years come as they say, 
<start>But I feel sad as I tell you 
<start>That I may never forget 
<start>When there's something on your lips 
<start>That's sweet and fresh and true; 
<start>The joy that you have given me 
<start>Will not have faded away 
<start>If my love were one small part. 
<start>I think that I'd say what I ought 
<start>To say to you, 
<start>For a girl like
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>That day and all the nights, 
<start>My own sweet Mary, 
<start>My sister Mary. 
<start>And when they set me out 
<start>All they knew of me 
<start>Were the dear old books, 
<start>The songs I loved so well; 
<start>And every thing I tried 
<start>Was my own dear Mary. 
<start>In the old time, 
<start>In the old time, 
<start>My brothers and sisters 
<start>Had a little house, 
<start>Built it out of a well, 
<start>On the spot where Mary lived. 
<start>We were so used to it, 
<start>And my little mother,  
<start>We would build the home 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>All the year: 
<start>The children and the wife, 
<start>The brothers and the best of friends, 
<start>Did not heed the noise. 
<start>The night came on and the day, 
<start>And the child went wandering; 
<start>They were all asleep: 
<start>They were all asleep. 
<start>She said to them, 
<start>Come, come, play at a yard; 
<start>For our toys are lying fast, 
<start>And we shall all lie down to rest; 
<start>And there shall sleep 
<start>The little bird of every breeze! 
<start>The girl she loved well and well, 
<start>And the little bird of every breeze, 
<start>Will do
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>The time they got to wed in London town in May. 
<start>When his dear parents took him to his mother's, they knew 
<start>He was their only son. 
<start>And what was that thing about you I can't explain. 
<start>He's a fine boy, my little lad, 
<start>And I love him well enough 
<start>But, my dear, he never was proud of his little boy. 
<start>But when they went to bed each day 
<start>I wonder would this be to-day. 
<start>As I'm lying there in bed you would think, 
<start>That I would come and visit you. 
<start>A good old woman is she, I do not know her name, 
<start>And so let me
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And how your little heart and dear 
<start>Will make us both glad. 
<start>Your little heart has little sorrows; 
<start>You, too, have some inmost need; 
<start>And oh, would I were you, too, 
<start>I'd have you take the hand that holds 
<start>The heart of me so young. 
<start>How does a little girl grow up 
<start>If I can only keep her, dear, 
<start>As a loving mother's child 
<start>Will be to mine? 
<start>I do not love a boy because I am blind 
<start>And my heart grows cold and frail; 
<start>Or because my heart grows weary that you 
<start>Have no mother's care
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>This one I hold that you are not so bright 
<start>As to know who and what this beautiful man 
<start>Is. Who is he, and what are his looks? 
<start>A man of manners: a man full bright, 
<start>But without all manners; a man whose ears 
<start>Were deaf when he looked at them with great tears. 
<start>A man that is both high and low: with feet, 
<start>Not all smooth, I know not where he goes or who. 
<start>The soul, by no fault of those who love, is high 
<start>And noble, and without distinction is the man 
<start>Who keeps the holy church, as one might say 
<start>In heaven, and is himself the leader of the Church:
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>To think that I have been dreaming. 
<start>When all my work is finished, I forget 
<start>How often the night comes on in my face 
<start>To haunt me with a spell so dreadful, 
<start>That I almost forget to speak. 
<start>Ah! may I meet the dawn, the dew-drenched dew! 
<start>On the low-rented roof that is the wall's 
<start>So high; and the soft wind stirs, along the slope 
<start>By the window in the corner, all my own: 
<start>The wind sighs, and the wind sighs in the window-seat 
<start>Up and down the glimmering chimneys now and then, 
<start>And the lamp glimmers in the
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And had so many faults that once they found 
<start>Their pride's own enemy in a boy's best face. 
<start>They were so mad! They had but three 
<start>As well as three great sins. 
<start>It was a sight as though 
<start>That little house of yours  
<start>Was full of love and sin - 
<start>And all to heaven - 
<start>So they fell off together, 
<start>And they went to church 
<start>And kissed, and prayed, an angel's name: 
<start>And that one said; 
<start>And I know what thou seest 
<start>My lady's eyes: 
<start>But thou wadst have the sin 
<start>Nor the sin to
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>Until in days like these I've toiled and knitted, 
<start>And when ye read it, I do love you. 
<start>When now your head the pillow o'er hath flung, 
<start>And my spirit rests where now it rests in sleep, 
<start>And the sun sets, I feel the soul's deep love 
<start>Creeping in my heart's warm veins to sleep. 
<start>Ye seem, alas, to have died with me no less. 
<start>No more my life was in your hands, nor could a friend 
<start>Of some unkind heart that loves you more to-night. 
<start>But, ah, I see the end, and my heart, I know it now! 
<start>I have gone back to sleep, I
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>As well as for the Lord who sent me here 
<start>To do just as he ordered, or I might 
<start>Have done for other men, who now are here 
<start>Just as you have wished, but more for me. 
<start>In the beginning came this life, this man 
<start>Who never failed to serve his God in Heaven. 
<start>The end, O life with which I now have been 
<start>That I have ever been should pass with ease, 
<start>And all unafraid of all, even if we should die. 
<start>That it had come, let me know, to serve Him well. 
<start>I am as I became him when I came of old; 
<start>My hands were in the hands of Christ now
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>As you sit here on the throne 
<start>Of the little garden green 
<start>Across the river. 
<start>It is cold on the garden side; 
<start>I'm going back to bed. 
<start>It is pleasant when the sky grows grey; 
<start>And in the dark I can't see the sky. 
<start>I do not know what you say 
<start>In the little garden green, 
<start>But I know I am going to meet you a bit, 
<start>If you have no doubt in it. 
<start>A windy day I've seen 
<start>All over the garden; the sun is shining. 
<start>The sun is shining on the old farmhouse on the mountain side 
<start>And
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>Beneath my brow; 
<start>I hope that your heart will be kind, 
<start>My dear, at this hour 
<start>When life seems so wild and fair, 
<start>For me and you. 
<start>I wish, indeed, if, as the sun 
<start>Climbs to the horizon, 
<start>The clouds on high on the clouds 
<start>Shine, and the dark waves fall, 
<start>As our hearts on our breasts are, 
<start>I'd gladly look through you. 
<start>I dream of the days you lead us through 
<start>And the days that have followed me. 
<start>My heart leaps to believe the word 
<start>That the skies are bright and clear, 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>With me the wild day was done. 
<start>My heart was broken with dread 
<start>I fled with all the night to seek 
<start>That city where the Gods were born, 
<start>And I sought I sought for shelter there, 
<start>And the night was dark and cold. 
<start>Oft, far in the glimmering hours, 
<start>I heard with eager tread 
<start>The hoarse and dismal call of folk; 
<start>And I heard the murmur of the sea. 
<start>Oft, even through the wooded glen, 
<start>I knew a voice in the night's decay 
<start>Call me, as a child of mine: 
<start>It murmured as it heard from far away: 
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>I can't remember that I was born 
<start>I remember everything, 
<start>And you said, It was as it had been: 
<start>You told me once I was a slave. 
<start>Then there was a man who tried to steal 
<start>The rights of a woman under the sod: 
<start>If you're not one of me and you see 
<start>He's making a deal for a half-million there 
<start>I think the man could have thought to stop 
<start>By putting away both his wife and his son, 
<start>All of a sudden I'd say, Go home! 
<start>The woman laughed:  Well, I've been a great man a week now, 
<start>And you say that my wife's
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>Till we come back from that pleasant place, 
<start>The land of fairy trees and snow. 
<start>It was a lonely place, the land of dreams, 
<start>Of woods, waters, springs, and groves with fountains 
<start>Of pure, sweet waterfalls and gushing streams 
<start>In the dark, silent waterfalls. 
<start>From off the edge they came, 
<start>Like some wild hag 
<start>From the wild forest wandering through, 
<start>And seemed to tell 
<start>Of life, of thoughts and ways, 
<start>Of ancient and strange lore, 
<start>Of golden visions strange, 
<start>Of ancient songs, of fairy tales, like these, 
<start>Of
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>That comes through the haze of tears, 
<start>Because, all the while, my love's face 
<start>Dew-grows on the sea-shore cold  
<start>For you and me I love for all, 
<start>And for those who come into my home 
<start>And those who come unto my door. 
<start>I would to the olden time 
<start>Look up and see it with fond eyes, 
<start>And, ah, when the wind blows loud and dreary, 
<start>I would see her come through the mists 
<start>And whisper, O, I have found thy heart! 
<start>I would remember my love! 
<start>I would remember a sweet, red, white face! 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>When the wind came up from the west. 
<start>When the birds were in a chorus 
<start>They sang one song of home-giving. 
<start>They were not singing out loud 
<start>To the children of the town: 
<start>Sweet ones, when the summer came, 
<start>You would hear the children's psalm, 
<start>The children's hymn, the children's song. 
<start>And you might not leave the town, 
<start>It was not all for summer days; 
<start>But the children of the little ones 
<start>They were never, never lonely. 
<start>Their feet did not run all the way 
<start>With the wind to and fro; 
<start>And they danced together, all
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And of me. 
<start>O gentle, gracious spirit! 
<start>Thou canst not miss the joy 
<start>When thou hast spoken the truth 
<start>To us the past to cheer, 
<start>By our own sweet voices singing, 
<start>The love one brings back to thee: 
<start>How we were happy in those days, 
<start>When the joys of old were ours! 
<start>How we are happy today, 
<start>When the sweetest of all loves 
<start>Comes to us once a-weary; 
<start>When the heart is strong in love, 
<start>When there is a joy to cheer, 
<start>To all our longings evermore 
<start>Of
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>All the year, in the sunbeams high 
<start>Asters in the dew, when they came out 
<start>To be seen in the twilight glade. 
<start>So, the old woman whispered in their ears,  
<start>When they looked in the sunset's light, 
<start>And the little boy said, You have done me wrong 
<start>In the days when you were not here to-day! 
<start>They whispered softly, Do you think you can 
<start>Wear me so? How shall I bear you back? 
<start>What means it? All for the life this world 
<start>I longed to hold dear till you come home? 
<start>Ah, I knew it not! I dared not say no prayer, 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>With the old mill-wheel, 
<start>And the old mill-wheel was a lonely thing. 
<start>O, then the old mill-wheel! 
<start>Why didst Thou make it so? 
<start>The old mill-wheel, 
<start>Old as Death! 
<start>Now it is shining 
<start>Through yon gleaming sun, 
<start>And they are marching along. 
<start>Yon gleaming mill-wheel, 
<start>Old as Death! 
<start>The old mill-wheel, 
<start>Still it shines on, 
<start>And it glides ever 
<start>In the light of the old mill-wheels. 
<start>Up and down, and they are marching, 
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>To see that a book I like to own 
<start>Of my own works would give its praise.' 
<start>'Yes, yes,' he said, ''What a beautiful book 
<start>Its title is my little life to hold. 
<start>Let it be named after me and yours.' 
<start>'The book is yours,' she said in that tone 
<start>That made the author tremble. 
<start>'I am yours.  And you,' she said 
<start>'I 'think you have, the world over.' 
<start>So this was hers; and she stood there and waited 
<start>To hear him speak.  'And that's how I come down.' 
<start>I am yours, and he was hers. 
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>When the day comes, when you will say, 
<start>I will go out in the evening 
<start>Into the dark to lay a nap 
<start>Over the dead of the night? 
<start>For, come down out of the morning 
<start>I am writing your last lines 
<start>For to say my farewell 
<start>To the men and the women who lived 
<start>This day to come and the time 
<start>To wait for you with a cry 
<start>From the dead of the night. 
<start>What will you do if I tell you so? 
<start>How will you take my hand, 
<start>You to a place where a king is 
<start>A little child, and all 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>Who was with me at that time 
<start>To play around, and still be near, 
<start>To sing in my grave, and still be there. 
<start>In that same night when you were dead, 
<start>There was peace in each of us, 
<start>The happy little town had peace, 
<start>And goodly books to read and play. 
<start>And no one thought to tell you where 
<start>The house-walls of your house were set; 
<start>And yet he did not think for certain 
<start>Your face was happy and bright. 
<start>'Twas very strange the place you were so near, 
<start>The little town, though dim, 
<start>When all around you seemed a star
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>Of other boys and girls of the house 
<start>They called me out of the house and the streets, 
<start>And my mother was at times like a nun, 
<start>And I tried to hide behind a bush 
<start>Till I found another man and killed him. 
<start>And I hid and hid away on the floor 
<start>And I tried to run away to the hall 
<start>When my mother came back through the house-door. 
<start>And I said:  There is a light in the room, 
<start>That the door is ashen with my hand; 
<start>It is the very door that swings so soon 
<start>Through which your footsteps will be slow. 
<start>But I cannot get the keys to the door 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>When they saw the light that burned in the 
<start>Darkenings of the dark. 
<start>O, for the joys of the wildwood wood, 
<start>O, for the golden dreams of the wood, 
<start>Where the flowers of summer blow, 
<start>And the sun burns low above the head, 
<start>And the earth seems like a golden tomb! 
<start>Oh, for the beauty of the grass, 
<start>O, for the spring of love and laughter, 
<start>And the spring of laughter! 
<start>Oh, for the joy of all things fair 
<start>Which are born of earth, 
<start>And no earth is earth but love's joy 
<start>When the light that burns within 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And your face is bright; 
<start>Then you are beautiful and tall and white, 
<start>And fair, too, and good; 
<start>And they say that your eyes are too red 
<start>For the blue on the sky. 
<start>And so, when we part, you may forget us, 
<start>And not look at us. 
<start>Now my heart aches so bitterly 
<start>That I cannot bear the thought that I am weeping, 
<start>As I go home to my play; 
<start>And my heart aches in the house so lonely 
<start>That every one is sad and alone; 
<start>And if the roses go out at the window 
<start>And the wind blows no more; 
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>Of your own thoughts and their ills. 
<start>The song you sing, 
<start>I love; I hate. 
<start>I love you well. 
<start>I love you well as a bird sings: 
<start>I love you well as a woman sings: 
<start>I love you well, 
<start>While it sings. 
<start>The rose I love is not so pink as the rose that is white, 
<start>Its eyes but look so long; my life is but a long dream. 
<start>My roses look like the eyes of the moon, when she comes to sleep, 
<start>She is still when she speaks, her kisses are sweet to my heart; 
<start>When I have learned to love, she's never seen but
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>Which your eyes never shut! 
<start>There is little you would need to say 
<start>To find in the world your own; 
<start>Only be sure, as I ween, 
<start>It is little you must ask. 
<start>Here with all the sweetness of your heart 
<start>He lies in peace and rest. 
<start>Thoughts and sensations of love were dear  
<start>To me only were dear. 
<start>I would not do the thing that you 
<start>Do for me this day! 
<start>The night was cold and drear and drear 
<start>With the mist that swept above, 
<start>And nothing was there with me, save dreams, 
<start>The windless sky
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>A-mousing. And they had a-tossing up and down 
<start>The wood-walk there. 
<start>When there came a voice said, Give me the keys! 
<start>We, who made great music before, 
<start>Who still play the sweetest game, 
<start>Said, Take the keys away! 
<start>And I told them, You will, for all the rest, 
<start>Give the keys away in the box. 
<start>And they made music; they sang and they crooned, 
<start>And I played one note or the other, 
<start>Until at last, 
<start>I have caught the key and I own I love you still, 
<start>In the box. 
<start>The house
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>As mad as a man 
<start>The night they were born:  A dream she gave him; 
<start>And a woman bore him in her arms; 
<start>A woman bare him to and fro, 
<start>Till the mother gave him birth, 
<start>And the nurse bore him to her arms. 
<start>To a man it seems, 
<start>If one of you want it, 
<start>The best one should come to my knee, 
<start>With a gun and pistol and a knife, 
<start>In the night the mother gave him birth; 
<start>And she never shall come to my knee, 
<start>Though he has a gun and a knife. 
<start>I do love you, John, John, John, 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>With one another. 
<start>Oh, what have they done with you, my dear Sir? 
<start>They have put you on a horse 
<start>And laid you down 
<start>To lie on your knees before the fire, 
<start>To lie there and wait 
<start>A month or so. 
<start>But who shall help you now or a day  
<start>To sit at the window a while  
<start>To see the moon at eve? 
<start>How shall I know that my poor heart is not 
<start>To hear the soft song on the window pane   
<start>Of all-hearing heaven! 
<start>Or to be seen laughing or to be seen weeping  
<start>Just by the moonlight?
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>And the light of your eyes so blue. 
<start>When the spring winds come and are still, 
<start>When the shadows come and are still, 
<start>When you feel like the wind in a tree 
<start>And the snow in a pool of snow. 
<start>I love and adore you the while 
<start>I can think that my tears will spill 
<start>For some hidden thought among the trees 
<start>While you love and I am alone. 
<start>I love and adore you the while 
<start>I can think that my tears will spill 
<start>For some hidden thought among the trees 
<start>While you love and I am alone. 
<start>I love and adore you the while 
<start>And I am alone
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>In their own narrow room, 
<start>Where they couldn't find one 
<start>To talk to, or see. 
<start>A small child sat close a-rolling 
<start>His water-can; 
<start>For there, on the floor, there lay down 
<start>A child the baby. 
<start>For the little child was sleeping 
<start>On a mossy plot, 
<start>And a child sat by his side 
<start>For an hour or so. 
<start>They would not speak, nor call; 
<start>They were too weary of their sleep. 
<start>They would not dream; 
<start>They were too tired of anything; 
<start>The little thing, in all 
<start>Its play
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>To lie down and dream 
<start>How the days grew more solemn and far away  
<start>How the flowers grew, the flowers grew, 
<start>And the wind sighed above, and murmured o'er the brooks, 
<start>And the winds were blowing, and the breeze was blowing, 
<start>And I dreamed of your face, 
<start>In the darkness and the rain, 
<start>And the grassy paths 
<start>That we trod with you. 
<start>We went into the forest alone, 
<start>Like one who will not heed 
<start>The whispers that fall 
<start>From unseen things, 
<start>And no word of hope or warning seemed to speak at all. 
<start>The summer passed fast asleep in
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>And the world to hear; for my heart beats fast; 
<start>But no, for you I must try and make it plain 
<start>That something has gone. 
<start>And I said to him with a loud and solemn word, 
<start>And then I looked with such a gentle look, 
<start>I was afraid you'd not be aware, 
<start>That I was looking at my own heart and I was crying, 
<start>And he would not hear. 
<start>So, we parted in love.  And then I told him I would sleep 
<start>And not be able, until I found that life was near 
<start>And he must feel you; and I, of all who see it 
<start>Of all the years that have to go before
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>And the warm warmth of your breast. 
<start>Your breath of the wind, 
<start>Your golden breath of the winds, 
<start>O my love, in the year's new year of joy. 
<start>I long for the wind of your breath 
<start>And the warm warmth of your breast. 
<start>Your voice is so strong, 
<start>It makes me sick to hear you smile, 
<start>You speak so gently and sweetly, 
<start>But my heart is so hot with your tears. 
<start>But I will not rest from these to-night: 
<start>You must go and rest a little, 
<start>Till you break sleep into the night. 
<start>Lips are bright, and mine are cold
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And they were sure that they 
<start>Could not be happier than they, 
<start>Singing every day 
<start>The little songs that we sang 
<start>One morning in a dream. 
<start>They sang with soft and wistful fingers, 
<start>And a golden music made them glad, 
<start>With a joy that was always sweet and serene, 
<start>As they slept and did sing of God! 
<start>With a sweet voice and a tender smile, 
<start>With a heart of light and grace, 
<start>And to love one another with soft and tender care 
<start>I heard the words they sang together. 
<start>Oh, they were glad and they were sure! the children of a day 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>In those green arms, 
<start>And we'll fight forever 
<start>To make thee love. 
<start>Their eyes were blue and bright, 
<start>And in the golden dew 
<start>Their hearts were pure; 
<start>Their limbs were white and long, 
<start>And in the wind were red; 
<start>Their eyes were bright in sleep, 
<start>And in the sun. 
<start>And to-morrow I 
<start>Shall see them play, 
<start>And see them pass along the road 
<start>With song and dance. 
<start>At sunset in the glade, 
<start>The birds together lay  
<start>'Mid the daisies' green abune 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And your great names you say you're reading 
<start>And your poems I'm sending you: 
<start>It was not with the heart that I dreamed 
<start>I should forget you to the grave! 
<start>What could be worse than the loss of your dear ones 
<start>Without them? I wonder why I should 
<start>Have done this to my lovely lost one 
<start>And let it fade away with the sun? 
<start>It was not my duty to have forgotten her, 
<start>But you were mine in my poor life to lose her! 
<start>Why does my soul always want such a friend? 
<start>It is because 'twill always find me so 
<start>At a certain point when I must part - 
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>As you walk by my side and hold it on my arm! 
<start>To-day my hair is bright and pure, but they care not what 
<start>You tell me you do and say to me so often  
<start>And I love you for a heart so loyal and so sweet; 
<start>O, I love you more than all men, to you for me  
<start>I love you, I love you! 
<start>When the dawn has passed and the flowers are all ablaze 
<start>I dream not of any thing but the rose in the hall: 
<start>The roses are soft and fragrant with the wine of the rose, 
<start>Each blooming and fragrant that I love is a kiss of the hour: 
<start>And your sweet eyes
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>When the last thing in your life's history 
<start>Is that day, the moment! 
<start>Oh, dear, dear, dear mother, 
<start>I do not fear the winter weather; 
<start>As cold as snow itself, 
<start>My life will be an endless night of summer, 
<start>Of sunshine, of evening, of flowers, 
<start>Of dew, of water, of birds and bees, 
<start>Of winds that laugh, and waters rung. 
<start>But no, my little boy, for oh, what a dream 
<start>Of things to be, and of days as new! 
<start>Of dreams that were once joys, like this once fireside, 
<start>And now are filled with fears!
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>While the night is bright, and the white night sky 
<start>Is a white thing of the sun that is white as the sea. 
<start>I have been a man and thought you a fool, 
<start>I am a coward of truth, and a slave of lust. 
<start>I am proud of you as a child who sees the whole world 
<start>Unshadowed and unguessed to the world's edge; 
<start>I am proud to play with your life, to live at ease, 
<start>To go out and see its faces a-gloomed like gold, 
<start>To dream of how you will meet them with a face to meet to face  
<start>So it brings to me my pain. 
<start>To dream of life before the dark
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>To take from me, all this world of sorrow. 
<start>The music was all right 
<start>And the sound came on clear again 
<start>As it came from the lips of a lover, 
<start>As it came from a man's voice. 
<start>Through the long twilight of the night 
<start>The long shadows swept o'er the grass, 
<start>And through the wooded gardens, where 
<start>The sun went down to bed, 
<start>The flowers looked up and smiled, 
<start>The birds sang in their nests. 
<start>I listened and listened with wondering eyes, 
<start>For I could tell all the voices there 
<start>Were still the same, like bees, 
<start>That sing on
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>And the sweet breath of your smile. 
<start>I stand and gaze 
<start>Upon your face,  
<start>And feel each throb 
<start>Of your breath 
<start>And the rapture, I may own  
<start>Is not yours. 
<start>They live for you  
<start>Your presence. 
<start>What can they give in return? 
<start>I might as well give you but that's 
<start>Why I don't think that any can. 
<start>Who would have thought it was so, 
<start>So rich, so true, 
<start>If I held with my hands the cold 
<start>White hand of an old hand so near 
<start>That it was cold as
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>For which, I would to the world you give 
<start>Its present, present, future breath! 
<start>Wherever my tongue can spell the place, 
<start>The story or the name, I'll read. 
<start>The heart's delight, the pleasure, the 
<start>Life of man or maid, I'll know. 
<start>Awa, then, to me, and to the wind! 
<start>That the sun will set! and, for no ill! 
<start>I know, and I would rather live and die 
<start>Than evermore to live and die.' 
<start>To me, in the wind's breath, and in the wave, 
<start>I said, 'I may be dead but one!' 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>For the Lord and the Bride. 
<start>They were maddened and saddened, 
<start>To see the brides of old 
<start>Come rushing down and down 
<start>With banners waving. 
<start>They loved the Lord and the Bride, 
<start>They loved the Lady of the Lake 
<start>And all his children dear  
<start>But no, no, no that no 
<start>Was ever heard of the Bride of Love. 
<start>Sail it, sailor, sail away, 
<start>The ocean is near; 
<start>The waves are rushing up and down, 
<start>And the waves are wet and grim, 
<start>And the sun is setting out, 
<start>And the stars are high and
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>The very day before they were born. 
<start>And all the little children 
<start>Brought the morning meal every eighteen: 
<start>Brought it on the morn until nine. 
<start>Each little child took it up to his mother, 
<start>Aged as young as fifteen years, 
<start>And her baby she left out, 
<start>And went to sleep upon his mother's knee. 
<start>But by and by the next morning it came 
<start>To Mrs. Hodge, and her husband lay, 
<start>And the old man called her name: Nanny, Nanny. 
<start>Then, at ten, he called her Mother, Nanny. 
<start>And she had nothing but a little baby, 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>In your last good time, my dear! 
<start>I hear the bellows of my friend; 
<start>It rings in my heart of hearts again; 
<start>But there's a dark cloud of clouds around. 
<start>O love! my love! love comes not, dear, 
<start>Nor ever shall return; 
<start>I have a heart that's not fit to break, 
<start>I have a heart that is weak! 
<start>Love comes to my body, ah! nevermore 
<start>I shall come back again. 
<start>O little girl, my little girl, 
<start>Come back and let me sleep, for I am tired; 
<start>With all your cares and trouble 
<start>I shall not wake for
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>On me, on me, on me. 
<start>That is enough; you are too true 
<start>To break my heart that day. 
<start>But when you see me waking now 
<start>A little boy, to-night, 
<start>With eyes so bright and red to-night 
<start>Are you, I can never see 
<start>Save in another day. 
<start>Then, boy, come home to me once more, 
<start>And learn from me this love of you: 
<start>The warmth of your smile on me, on me, on me, 
<start>And from me you must go. 
<start>How can you keep me so still, that I do miss 
<start>The light of your look? 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>While you do not come. 
<start>I am a child of a thousand years 
<start>And have lost all time. My days and months 
<start>Have been as long as the world has been, 
<start>And I cannot keep a watch on these things. 
<start>I feel as I used to feel before, 
<start>I cannot do this thing again. 
<start>I am but a child of a thousand years 
<start>And have lost all time. I have lived, I dare 
<start>To lose my passion for you for all. 
<start>Oh, my children, oh, my heart that aches for you. 
<start>For you have been true to its root. 
<start>I can feel as I used to I dare to feel
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>For very few and very few,  
<start>For no-one I hear a voice, 
<start>Nor hear a murmur of the grass  
<start>No sound but from the feet of God. 
<start>As I walk on through the wood 
<start>The wind, with his thin airy tread, 
<start>Leaps at the window to his door, 
<start>And my own face sees behind us glide; 
<start>The silence seems to say: 
<start>Oh, my dear Son, my heart it cannot see, 
<start>My head it cannot press; 
<start>Dear Father, I could not choose but see him, 
<start>Because no tears were shed upon my brow: 
<start>Thou art the Lord of
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>With passion now, of love, and love is dead, 
<start>Dead with all your dead, that we might part, 
<start>Where all the dead may part! Death, with a smile, 
<start>Died with your dead, on those bright days in Paris 
<start>When he would have passed in beauty's dream! 
<start>How fair is Paris! We must thank him, dear. 
<start>The garden is full; and as we part, 
<start>And love lies hidden in the laurel-boughs, 
<start>The moonlight creeps up through the rose and down 
<start>Through the white walls, where the old oak-tree's branches shine. 
<start>At times it may be hard to hear alone, 
<start>Though the
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>When the rain comes down from the hill! 
<start>I long for the sun that shines above  
<start>When the world grows warm and fair! 
<start>The dawning of the morning  
<start>Ah, never could I have thought on the day of my own birth and 
<start>When I was a boy, 
<start>In a garden green, 
<start>With a fragrant garden every sunny month.... 
<start>The old world's flower and bloom 
<start>As they used to grow in the old days; 
<start>The moon was set at evening, 
<start>The sun shone out all night, 
<start>A rainbow with glory, 
<start>A misty cloud over the western sky. 
<start>Oh my
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And all your work you tell me now, 
<start>When God's praise is a blessing all. 
<start>All my life that must be said before I die 
<start>Has been to live, to love, to hold me dear, 
<start>To be a symbol of my worth in you, 
<start>To have a voice that sounds like your own. 
<start>You have touched with me too many ways, 
<start>Through the years that are to follow me, 
<start>And yet how strong a soul has grown, 
<start>To live who knows not the loss you must bear. 
<start>My heart is one small pulse on the wings of time 
<start>Or a sudden thought will wake it away. 
<start>I am the one little song
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And love they were free; 
<start>They thought of what they wad be, 
<start>And loved what she had done; 
<start>And when they heard her laugh, 
<start>They rose up in glee; 
<start>But when they heard her wag her  
<start>'Tis a sin to smile! 
<start>In my first garden 
<start>I had a fair young May; 
<start>And she was very kind, 
<start>But a darlingsome flower! 
<start>And I thought 'twas very very kind, 
<start>But I could not hold her: 
<start>And I thought 'twas very sweet, 
<start>But a darlingsome flower. 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>Before their love 
<start>They were glad with God and man. 
<start>The moon was bright on all the skies, 
<start>And on his feet the stars were shining; 
<start>Yet through his veins of fire, 
<start>And through his heart of fire, 
<start>He cried, 'What madness here to go 
<start>'Tis but a dream! 
<start>The darkness crept from out the hills 
<start>And the world was still. 
<start>As when one man, bent on setting sun, 
<start>First fanned his fires, and then he took each flame 
<start>And sent his word along; 
<start>Their light each gave the rest away, 
<start>As many a star has given; 
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>Since you came and found the place; 
<start>Though the flowers seemed to be sleeping  
<start>The sun was risen. 
<start>A little star, 
<start>And nothing, yet, 
<start>The music of the roses 
<start>And of the dewdrops. 
<start>I had not loved all your life 
<start>Until you came to me. 
<start>The sunlight came, and you came,  
<start>With the sun in the sky; 
<start>I kissed you as I passed the door, 
<start>And no more heard, 
<start>I came not back for you. 
<start>A light, 
<start>A light! 
<start>A light! 
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>And my soft lips' glad kisses yet, 
<start>And I go into the valley of bliss, 
<start>Like a shadow in the night.... 
<start>I wish my soul was in that place, 
<start>Where the silent trees close 
<start>As the sun on a summer day 
<start>Loosens when the spring goes by, 
<start>And the sweet-tongued winds come singing their songs 
<start>Unto a sweet ear where the winds are so near. 
<start>I wish but to breathe into your eyes 
<start>The light that shines through the mist, 
<start>And the light that is so near, 
<start>And, above, the light that is so far 
<start>My soul from her to her
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>When we came back home. 
<start>Oh, how sad they were! 
<start>I can see their faces, I can read their sighs  
<start>And feel their tears, 
<start>They will never come back to me again! 
<start>They were in tears. 
<start>Why should I sigh upon the grave I know. 
<start>When I go out to-night to-night I lie down; 
<start>I know full well their sorrows are so few  
<start>They are all forgotten and forgotten;  
<start>Oh, how sad they are, oh, how weary they are! 
<start>To-night I do not weep nor even look at them again. 
<start>Oh, so sad they are when I look at them again
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>And for your pleasure, as you know, 
<start>And because I really can 
<start>It is all a dream of mine. 
<start>I am in tears that fall from one's eyes, 
<start>And weep upon myself 
<start>For having been a woman when they met, 
<start>And I am in the agony of their strife, 
<start>And they have loved me still and I'm here to-day. 
<start>At least what can you tell me of this? 
<start>You did not love, though you did not love me yet, 
<start>Though you did not love me yet and yet, 
<start>Till you were a woman again. Oh, not once, not twice, 
<start>I was woman then. 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>'Twas only when we made a choice between our swords, 
<start>And died a fool. 
<start>And I said: Let your love lie 
<start>Within me, 
<start>When your love dies, 
<start>And your love dies with me. 
<start>I said: I shall live 
<start>And I will live long 
<start>On the grass and the grass and the grasses with the trees; 
<start>The bowers are bright, 
<start>Shall I love them 
<start>With my love? 
<start>I said: I shall love them 
<start>With a heart 
<start>Of love, 
<start>And love no more; 
<start>And the earth lies empty and desolate in
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And the dear things you did for me. 
<start>I wish that you made a song 
<start>For a heart to hear; 
<start>If you did, there would be joy in its sound. 
<start>To-morrow I have seen you; 
<start>O for the flowers that you bade me win! 
<start>If the flowers ye loved for me 
<start>Were not roses, 
<start>Will ye be in vain, my boy? 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you. 
<start>I thought that he came home yesterday, 
<start>And I knew that his mother was ill; 
<start>The tears that the blue eyes came to me 
<start>Would not give me rest; 
<start>But
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>Their faces danced. 
<start>They kissed, and their tongues together twirl'd, 
<start>Filling the blue, 
<start>And their limbs with a purple foam were gasht with rain: 
<start>And all the earth beneath them shook with a crash; 
<start>And on their backs they fell. 
<start>It was only the snow's red frost, 
<start>The wild snow's red, 
<start>That had made your snow-white snow 
<start>So stiff and white. 
<start>With the wind's wild shriekings and the cry of the storm, 
<start>Your hearts made strange 
<start>And still, like frozen logs in the rain, 
<start>Your faces danced. 
<start>It was only the
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>As the moonlight shed 
<start>Through the dark leaves of the pine-tree boughs, 
<start>And the pale flowers grew 
<start>Like the scent of dead men 
<start>Swinging along the way. 
<start>In the dim light of my window 
<start>You seemed to come as a child; 
<start>And I thought of flowers 
<start>That were not even roses, 
<start>But some sweet green flowers, 
<start>And the leaves were like the feet of a child 
<start>Swinging along the ways. 
<start>I went to bed 
<start>When I awoke, my tired tired head 
<start>Came up with the leaves to play, 
<start>And I dreamed of the world,
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>Of having to wander here  
<start>With the rain that poured down 
<start>O'er half-forgotten ways, 
<start>The lonely hours that passed 
<start>Between us, through the mist and haze  
<start>O that I was one again! 
<start>And a strange dream crept into my mind, 
<start>Of a woman who sat in the rain. 
<start>She had fallen through the flood, 
<start>And I had fallen into the sea; 
<start>But I was glad, for not alone in earth 
<start>I walked on my errand of rest. 
<start>And a strange night came upon me, and I woke, 
<start>And a strange vision came to me 
<start>Of the dark ship sailing
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>When the sun is in the west. 
<start>The last lines may be quoted from the 
<start>'Midst scenes of old romance. 
<start>The heart, the mind and eyes 
<start>Are fixed as to a place, 
<start>And that is the home they gave. 
<start>A few more lines from the Poet's Songs and Other Verses of 
<start>the 1795 edition. 
<start>Now, if you'll hear a song I sing 
<start>Of a long years since, 
<start>How oft you have heard the tale 
<start>The mother in the land has told, 
<start>But few have understood 
<start>The mother to this land. 
<start>A song of joy and grief, 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And thinking who you are, 
<start>There's you and there's she behind, 
<start>And she's there in the dark, 
<start>We'll meet again in the dark, it will be sweet when we are 
<start>Back to the city by the river-side. 
<start>My friend and my lover 
<start>We used to live together: 
<start>I used to see them by the river-side, 
<start>And all the old men 
<start>Where the rivers meet. 
<start>But the flowers went 
<start>To the mill and laughed and talked, 
<start>And the children 
<start>And the women 
<start>Told the truth. 
<start>And the water flowed 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>All alone, 
<start>Like one who in the dark 
<start>Sees nothing but the star-strewn town, 
<start>Not seeing any things new or strange, 
<start>Yet far beyond the city-wall; 
<start>I only know you all that live and be; 
<start>For whom can you and me be near, how long, 
<start>Though alone the old familiar scene 
<start>I cannot bear; 
<start>Or though I, alone at night, have toiled alone, 
<start>To watch and weep for you all alone; 
<start>With one strong kiss I cannot forget, 
<start>The other yearning for those eyes to see 
<start>The garden lights behind the eaves and see 
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>In the night's old cold face. 
<start>My heart, I wish I lay beside you softly 
<start>And caress your hair, 
<start>It lies still and is so soft and warm in the warm air: 
<start>I'd like to fold you in my arms, and kiss you, 
<start>I wish I could kiss you in my arms, and caress, 
<start>I would love to rest from the pain of your parting lips, 
<start>And the throbbing of your heart. 
<start>I would hear your happy voice, but always 
<start>I'd sigh for your smile, 
<start>As the silence of the night keeps dying away, 
<start>And the silence o'er my head grows heavy with your tears. 
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>Throbbing with grief. I am grieving: see 
<start>What little things about it grow, 
<start>So little that the whole life lasts. 
<start>This is my second life; I wait 
<start>To see your face again after me, 
<start>And know so long I must abide! 
<start>But wait, and you may come not back. 
<start>The leaves are falling, and the leaves are falling. 
<start>It may be so; you never saw her smile  
<start>I am weary and wearied, my own poor heart! 
<start>The leaf is lying in the grave! 
<start>The stars are slowly sinking, and I am dying. 
<start>And the sun is going west. 
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>With all the pride you deserve; 
<start>I am fain to bring that beauty home 
<start>From out her grave, my dear, 
<start>Whereby, in time to come, she shall be dear, 
<start>Thro' all the world afar. 
<start>At last one night, at dusk, when night 
<start>Is falling fast and fast, 
<start>A hush of music like a voice 
<start>In the wind comes o'er my head. 
<start>To make her welcome back is mine 
<start>As if she lived here now; 
<start>I am fain to bring some other day 
<start>There may yet be light. 
<start>I am fain to keep her all my life 
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>A little to yourself, for I should like 
<start>To be heard, even with such a voice, as you, 
<start>To have such an air.  But if I'd said 'Take me' 
<start>And he'd 'll listen!  I say 'You are alone.' 
<start>O love the woman I love so much, 
<start>'Gainst other women,' you say.  'If she's dead, 
<start>Or is some other one to blame?  Or is she mine?' 
<start>You have been with me long; perhaps 'twould make you well 
<start>To read it through again; but I've read not. 
<start>For it is your part 
<start>To have the woman in your heart, who would not
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>As you were all of a sudden. 
<start>To your delight and the pleasure you 
<start>Give to me I beg; 
<start>So, take the book from me and I 
<start>Will read it over. 
<start>How's that? 'T will be to go and tell 
<start>A story the way of a fairy, 
<start>With a great heart and a great heart's delight. 
<start>I'm really as glad as if I had not won 
<start>The glory of it all; 
<start>When I come home again, what will you care? 
<start>In the morning after the moonlight, 
<start>Let the paper take its rest. 
<start>Well? Well well? Well, aye! Here
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>There was no such thing as this! 
<start>And I had done and won me quite a few, 
<start>But when he spoke of these 
<start>And how to marry he began to cry, 
<start>With a shout 
<start>And a look of displeasure, 
<start>And he was like a boy who finds some way 
<start>To get a wife 
<start>In the world, they both must say. 
<start>He was like a young man in a dress 
<start>When the sunshine was breaking; 
<start>But I felt that his heart was breaking still 
<start>And a bit of him was missing him, for I knew 
<start>They were not very beautiful, 
<start>For he could not stay out much longer,
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>When we are gone and forgotten, 
<start>When things come and go at our will; 
<start>When the leaves look for rest in the sea, 
<start>Or a voice sings o'er the lonely sea. 
<start>When time to forget is in haste; 
<start>When the hour is not at your call; 
<start>When the face is not yet upon earth; 
<start>And your life is made for us all. 
<start>Oh, give us a rest, 
<start>For every hour of sadness and care! 
<start>There is no resting-place and no rest. 
<start>There is no rest in the bleak and drear sky! 
<start>'Tis only the cry of the sea, but the cry of the
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>As you are doing, I'm thinking of you: 
<start>To me the thought of you is an expression 
<start>From a heart-stifled moment that's a moment, 
<start>Though I can hear it only from the heart, 
<start>As it passes a moment on my ear, 
<start>Till my whole body turns to it again. 
<start>To all men of a heartless nature  
<start>To all mothers that are mothers of children   
<start>All the voices of the children, the voices 
<start>Of the mothers that are mothers of children    
<start>Are the words of the mothers that repeat. 
<start>To the mother that is loving   
<start>And the father who is kind, loving
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>With their own little lives. 
<start>They were mad and in love. 
<start>They had been out long enough 
<start>And they went back to sleep. 
<start>And I was alone now, you know, 
<start>But my heart still beats within me 
<start>And you have left me now! 
<start>And a heart that is cold-hearted, 
<start>It was as cold as the sea, 
<start>It was as cold as the sea, 
<start>It was true to me, my young life once. 
<start>My heart has known you now, my dear. 
<start>I am sick and weak like a bird 
<start>In a lonely nest; 
<start>I cannot make you welcome 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>Held by their love's desire. 
<start>When they did love he was glad: 
<start>So they all loved each other well: 
<start>And all night long he dwelt by her side 
<start>And watched her dancing round the shrine; 
<start>And when he'd left her she would see 
<start>That happy and gay face again. 
<start>'Twas she he saw she was so fair, 
<start>Sweet as to grace the earth again. 
<start>And she was so full of soul and glee 
<start>It seemed she was bound to stay 
<start>Until the time she came again. 
<start>Her hair it fluttered o'er his breast. 
<start>But little things he said  
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>That day, when I heard it so sweetly 
<start>Sing over the hill again. 
<start>O, I hear it once again, 
<start>But the sound has so deep and strong; 
<start>And the hills lie all in peace 
<start>Upon the dark blue sea as clear 
<start>As dreamer dreams when sleep is broken. 
<start>But yet my heart is weary, 
<start>And I hear it singing down the hill; 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you, 
<start>And I love you so well I think 
<start>That I might be with you to-night. 
<start>How the grass grows green 
<start>With the cool breezes of the evening, 
<start>And the
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And there was never a song made but these! 
<start>My soul was out of breath, my spirit came 
<start>With light and love and peace and love, in all 
<start>My fancy and desire and passion; one sweet 
<start>Sweet thought was in the air and one was in my heart, 
<start>I was not wise in the ways that of old, 
<start>But all the words came to my lips 
<start>As in a dream it was at will and then! 
<start>It was no dream but one 
<start>Of days that we have wandered to and died together, 
<start>Now we are reconciled; the stars are set, the night is done. 
<start>The summer is growing, day has risen high as well; 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>And we were so lonely and tired. 
<start>There were three children, sisters and daffodils 
<start>All about the yard; 
<start>To us they smiled in love as we drew near 
<start>From the wood we stood in the sun. 
<start>And their lips were so red, they were so bright 
<start>And soft and tender, and sweet, 
<start>And their white heads were so soft, they were so brown, 
<start>And their white feet were so small. 
<start>And their feet we knew as they went in and out, 
<start>With the touch of the sun. 
<start>And our eyes had tears of deep water for our eyes, 
<start>And our heart was in tears. 
<start>And we
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>Of the first hundred years of my life,  
<start>The first hundred years. 
<start>I am asking you what time I did not know the truth 
<start>I was a little older or that which you have known. 
<start>I am singing how, with so much love that is not true, 
<start>One night I stood under a tree, and gazed, and heard, 
<start>O'er long deserted acres, the wildest echoes of the wind, 
<start>From a distance. 
<start>For the tree is broken, and the wind's voice is not yet gone; 
<start>The wind came, and then I heard the old familiar echo of the rain, 
<start>The echo of the rain. 
<start>The old familiar echo of rain
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>With all the things that they did love that they could not understand 
<start>Though I heard a very strange thing within them say to the stars 
<start>I never asked them about it, for they were so still and serene. 
<start>They made music all day at dusk, and they had a garden in full bloom; 
<start>For even the sun made music to them, as round the garden they stood; 
<start>And the wind made music to them, as round the garden they stood. 
<start>They were so beautiful and sweet, and they were so young and so beautiful, 
<start>Like the blossoms of Autumn, in the garden, and in the sun, and even in the skies; 
<start>To them the stars were the things of joy and to me the sky was fair and serene,
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>Toiling on the sea-shore, 
<start>For the morning had a kiss on its lips, 
<start>They had forgotten their dreams. 
<start>They heard the rain, or the wind, upon the mountains passing, 
<start>Saying:  
<start>And I saw them in their dreams of Summer, dreaming in the woods. 
<start>One of them said:  
<start>And the other said:  and the sky grew black with the mist; 
<start>And there were dreams of sorrow and of tears and sorrow in the night. 
<start>They listened and they listened to some sweet words, and the words of the sea 
<start>Till the sea came singing in their heads. 
<start>And the sea sang in their heart of hearts the old woman who came
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>Like the old, old sea-birds, 
<start>In the long gray nights 
<start>When your songs are playing and breaking, 
<start>Playing, breaking like the wind along the shore, 
<start>And your heart is not aching in my breast; 
<start>I am sitting here in my dream-land; 
<start>I am dreaming, waking, 
<start>Dreaming  
<start>Of dreams that are too sweet for others, 
<start>Even as they are too sweet for me. 
<start>I wish you would rest in your old home, 
<start>And I love you, but I do not know: 
<start>I know I do not know you, yet 
<start>I know you are thinking to-night 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>When first I met them. 
<start>We were glad together, we were happy together,  
<start>A lonely and weary world that went round without beginning 
<start>To have its day on its feet to that one who had passed away. 
<start>When I met you, did you kiss me once, once, fond, gentle and gay? 
<start>We were sad together, we were glad together, loving you, 
<start>A lonely and weary world and a heavy burden to bear! 
<start>Then again did I kiss me once, fond, gentle and gay, while 
<start>'Till they all grew tired with the lonely road and the heavy road by the way, 
<start>As I sat on the long path in my heart in the desolate, lonely 
<start>And the weary
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>That is soft, sincere, and strong! 
<start>No less than she is far from me 
<start>The quietest, the truest shade; 
<start>And if I have not the strength 
<start>To lift my eyes from the tears 
<start>That have filled forever his eyes, 
<start>The heart-breaking peace he knows 
<start>Still cannot reach him when I am gone. 
<start>For even on the threshold of life, 
<start>Where all is hushed and sweetly said, 
<start>There lies a shadow and a shadow, 
<start>That lies far off 
<start>In its own sweet beauty alone; 
<start>And I stand above 
<start>And I see a shadow, whose shadow is 
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>To sing to your children; 
<start>And if they are not there yet, 
<start>I can sing you a song withal. 
<start>There is a house in England, 
<start>'Neath which you do not sit; 
<start>'N' the floor shines and the windows shine, 
<start>My children and I: 
<start>A' there are many a one 
<start>Who canst gaze upon it: 
<start>There are three women who sit there, 
<start>And two are of the same colour: 
<start>But the floor shines with the sunshine, 
<start>And the windows are bright with frost, 
<start>My little one dearie. 
<start>There is a garden near the town,
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>With the coldness of a month or two ago, 
<start>And the rain would trickle through and through. 
<start>Every flower was singing to the light, 
<start>And the birds were singing to the sound, 
<start>And they were humming for joy and 
<start>For glory and for love; 
<start>For love of him and of his mother, 
<start>And all her children; and for all they cared. 
<start>No little child was crying, but she ran 
<start>With all her hands over their blue eyes' blue, 
<start>And they smiled and cheered in the sunshine 
<start>For a little bird that would sing. 
<start>Now the wind died down before she came to bed 
<start>And the water was white over the
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>When I was young and lovely, dear. 
<start>If memory still can fill me with my love, 
<start>'Tis that my hand and heart are old; 
<start>And still the tears cannot fall from either side 
<start>To light the fire that lights the fire. 
<start>What though it seem the sky is gold, 
<start>Far cloud-like far, 
<start>Still doth be the beauty of the sky. 
<start>I cannot see the stars, 
<start>Nor hear the stars, 
<start>Nor see my soul 
<start>Beyond my feet. 
<start>The years that have passed 
<start>Have many ends. 
<start>The years that have gone 
<start>Will pass away.
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>O'er every day its golden hour; 
<start>Oh, the way you smile when I am sick! 
<start>The love that waits for me still waits 
<start>Upon your hand eternally: 
<start>And I shall love if it only live 
<start>The life before, if but a night. 
<start>The night will soon come when we part, 
<start>And the bright summer morning be,  
<start>And we will smile, with lips of love 
<start>Whose lips are ever mine and you; 
<start>Oh, the way you smile when I am sick! 
<start>The way you smile while I am sick! 
<start>The light that glows all around  
<start>I will never be forgot 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>In the dark and silent night. 
<start>I think about you while I am dreaming, 
<start>And my heart aches as I feel you, too, 
<start>In the silent night.... 
<start>O my heart is burning with passionate love, 
<start>Like the warm fire my tears are wet. 
<start>Do you feel sad for me when I pray, 
<start>Till you break through me in silence? 
<start>I do, but in my secret I would 
<start>In my peace and love have all the love 
<start>That's in your eyes; 
<start>That the sweet kiss upon your heart I hold 
<start>Will soon be gone, you know. 
<start>Do you want to say it? I will
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>And your tender, caressing words; 
<start>O dear, my love, this life is so brief, 
<start>To this your joy, my darling: 
<start>There is a sweet, a perfect peace, 
<start>In your fond, bright, loving hand. 
<start>O dear, my darling, this life is so quick, 
<start>To this your joy, my darling: 
<start>There is a soft, a sweet, a perfect peace, 
<start>In your fond, sweet, loving hand. 
<start>Ah! dear, dear, the day is but begun, 
<start>And we are far away to-night! 
<start>O love like the dawning of gladness, 
<start>Is it not enough, too soon
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>For her a love so bright and wild and gay. 
<start>But one day she saw a man 
<start>Singing, with a sigh of woe 
<start>And I was not content, 
<start>And left my own beloved. 
<start>The little boy was gone, 
<start>And I could not see him here 
<start>I was sad and weary all, 
<start>And we were walking by the spring, 
<start>When to a little brook one said, 
<start>This merry, merry little brook! 
<start>There was no one on the brook 
<start>But he did sing and sing, 
<start>And I was glad in my heart for so much 
<start>This little brook. 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>With the beautiful land of our dreams, 
<start>When the long gray skies 
<start>Are the dews that float at the feet of the sun. 
<start>We sit on the sand, in love with the beauty that the sky 
<start>And the sea, that we love,  
<start>With the deep, bright eyes 
<start>And the beautiful, sweet lips that kissed the sun 
<start>We shall never forget, 
<start>If our spirits rise up above the darkness of fate. 
<start>And we look upon the stars of the old and great that have risen out of old 
<start>And look into the sea, in our hearts, and we see how great our souls were made; 
<start>For it may be that they seemed to me like stars, but all
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>From what he had left. 
<start>In his youth the sea-weed did his cheeks 
<start>Became hot as Mars, 
<start>And his eyes grew hot and his cheeks 
<start>Were red and burning red. 
<start>He grew red by the sea-walls when 
<start>He came ashore. 
<start>But now, methinks, 
<start>He is a man of years, 
<start>Like all things else in his youth. 
<start>At first he was a little boy, 
<start>A boyhood boy: 
<start>His father and mother were the trees, 
<start>His home was a grove 
<start>And his mother was a little pool. 
<start>The sea-weed was his
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>On earth I should not long be here. 
<start>He spake, and o'er the garden sate 
<start>Each one a little while he trod; 
<start>But evermore he heard the wind 
<start>So softly blow the trees. 
<start>Then over the wide expanse he cast 
<start>A large and shining mantle white; 
<start>A garment of azure bright, 
<start>With golden tassels of the sea. 
<start>Oft in his wayward mind his head 
<start>Could scarcely bear to look; 
<start>And in his pride he thought upon his face, 
<start>At length reprieved to see 
<start>With horror, and no word she said: 
<start>When
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>With him for many a year: 
<start>He was their friend all day, 
<start>They were their master and he took them by the hand; 
<start>They had no fear of death: 
<start>They were brave men with bright eyes, 
<start>They were brave men with a hand. 
<start>So went their life together 
<start>Their path to be free; 
<start>They were brave as lions do deer; 
<start>They were true to God. 
<start>In their hearts was light and light they strove 
<start>To lighten and forget. 
<start>In their hearts was all the hope of God, 
<start>But the man was man at heart, 
<start>They were men and men together; 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>When I was a boy! 
<start>Dear, Dear, dear it is to be home, 
<start>Where never a wind-swept star, 
<start>Nor a bird hath peeped out, 
<start>And the stars and the waves are sleeping 
<start>On my heart's blue sea. 
<start>Come with me, come with me, come with me, 
<start>And the waves will sleep; 
<start>Come with us, come with us, come with us, 
<start>Come with me home! 
<start>The winds blow in and the sea-tides 
<start>Ring with laughter soft and glad, 
<start>And the ships lie at their port and wait 
<start>Watching your coming to-day 
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>When you are dead. 
<start>Oh, let it flow 
<start>Beneath, in the night, 
<start>The sea-bird is singing, 
<start>And they are flying 
<start>Where Love is born. 
<start>I am breaking from 
<start>That old refrain, 
<start>And I am a child that knows the deep 
<start>Of the deep of my own heart; a slave, 
<start>Of my own heart; a poor, weak, old beggar 
<start>Who has left no home to him; my very soul 
<start>To his. 
<start>Let the light go from 
<start>With the stars and be 
<start>A happy thought, until I may cease 
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>Because I could not write for a woman; 
<start>I would not, for the world would not agree 
<start>If I wrote for a man. 
<start>I love you all, 
<start>My love and the little things they say 
<start>I have loved of my life; all I have done 
<start>To make you happy in my dear eyes 
<start>Is to have you with me to-night. 
<start>The night is warm, the sky is clear, 
<start>The day is bright; 
<start>The angels' joys are gone; 
<start>The night is black, 
<start>The night is gray. 
<start>A song is a dream, 
<start>A heart that is strong and bright 
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>As I know, 
<start>That you'd rather the time be spent 
<start>With the old horse 
<start>Thinking for a while about it; 
<start>And 
<start>That if you'll put your heart into you, 
<start>If you will put your heart in me, 
<start>You'll have 
<start>The very best-natured way to win it. 
<start>You'll talk about your old horse 
<start>And how his back was got  
<start>What was it worth, I wonder, you 
<start>To say? 
<start>And you'll give him a kiss, 
<start>As I can see 
<start>How sweet your little green eyes are 
<start>As their
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>As, here below, I sit and stare at you. 
<start>O, I loved you so! 
<start>But now I'm sad because I love you not. 
<start>I am young and happy in a world of tears, 
<start>And I would not be glad by taking away 
<start>Your gifts from my mind to the place of woe, 
<start>Where you are always to be always true! 
<start>Now here I'm playing with my little game 
<start>For one hour only, in vain we are playing: 
<start>The ball to play before the other goes, 
<start>And you and I to lose when the play is over, 
<start>And it's over, my dear!.... 
<start>And
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>But my desire is cold, and you 
<start>In your smile are the same! 
<start>We are all at war 
<start>Over the river, 
<start>The fight's past. Time has flung 
<start>The foe back into the deep 
<start>Beyond the seas of sea, 
<start>And the world has drunk of 
<start>The tears of the night. 
<start>Heaven is filled with war, 
<start>And there is need of peace, 
<start>But peace is in the world, 
<start>And joy in the world. 
<start>Let our armies gather fast, 
<start>And we shall fight 
<start>For freedom, though it be too late. 
<start>Let war be
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>They were weary and alone. 
<start>And I stood up straight and took my rest 
<start>And felt the weight of my thoughts go on. 
<start>I looked back and saw my own once more 
<start>All of the world over. 
<start>I looked back and saw my own once more 
<start>And knew it was all over. 
<start>For I had longed for the old sea-shore 
<start>It was all of us, we were alone, 
<start>I knew but in that darkness alone 
<start>The world was made of us, and that night 
<start>Was all all of us, and that night was dark. 
<start>I looked back and saw them once again 
<start>Again there were no more stars to shine,
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>I love you so and truly! 
<start>I wish I were a child again, 
<start>And you would sit beside me, 
<start>Lest my heart be left behind me! 
<start>I am a man still; I am fair, 
<start>And so full of joy! 
<start>My feet are as white as milk, 
<start>My hair is like a golden goose, 
<start>I am so much a man, 
<start>I love you so and truly! 
<start>I wish I could see you more 
<start>I am so glad I could not see you 
<start>I thank you so! 
<start>My eyes are red because they are blind; 
<start>My heart is all broken in the frost
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>And a little babe was born  
<start>There she stood as the babe did lie, 
<start>In a little shelter-chair 
<start>With the words that I can't tell you, 
<start>It lay on the meadow wide; 
<start>A nest for baby, nest of the little ones, 
<start>Beneath a summer yew, 
<start>And then I saw the little babe in the grass, 
<start>All barefoot and laughing all alone. 
<start>And with love and tenderness to her, 
<start>With little children too, 
<start>I whispered to the child, I thought there might be naught 
<start>That might betide him, so I'll have you here for naught: 
<start>She thought
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>More sweet than the love of your brow. 
<start>For a little while I've dreamed of you, 
<start>And now my heart's warm heart beats, 
<start>And I love you no longer, O; 
<start>For a little while I've dreamed of you, 
<start>And I love you no longer, O; 
<start>I like the soft touch of your lips, 
<start>And I love you no longer, O, 
<start>For a little while I've dreamed of you, O; 
<start>And I love you the more for a little space, 
<start>Because the way they kiss you I feel, 
<start>And love you so, too, because you are so long, 
<start>For Love to come and go
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>As I see you, and I weep as I see you, 
<start>To think you so long ago ago. 
<start>And in a far, lone region of the night, 
<start>My soul shall not have time to mourn, 
<start>Where a young heart's love shall bring all I crave, 
<start>And no sad tear shall wash the tears away. 
<start>Not of the past or future. 
<start>Not of the future or past. 
<start>There was no music in the air, 
<start>No wind or rain, at the close of day; 
<start>My heart was like a child asleep 
<start>Among the flowers in the garden green, 
<start>And dreams were a thing unseen 
<start>In dreams that
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>Until a little wind 
<start>Astrain us, and sent their feet to beat 
<start>Their little hands at the gate. 
<start>Then they walked to the cottage door, 
<start>And they talked a little while, 
<start>Till all the room was a misted ghost, 
<start>An empty ghost, and the ghosts 
<start>Rocked and clambered away. 
<start>The cottage door swung wide, and the ghosts, 
<start>All grimly, stared out across 
<start>The window to the windows of the place, 
<start>And, from the open door, they heard. 
<start>They gazed out through dim corners of the night 
<start>Like some sad ghost in the dark. 
<start>The moon
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>And your caress, 
<start>And for the warmth of your heart, 
<start>Which I long to be 
<start>With you when you speak, 
<start>And I wish you were gone for ever 
<start>And as soon as I meet me face to face 
<start>I shall feel the cold and cold of the grave. 
<start>You must not, dear, I said, 
<start>Have a fear at thy breast... 
<start>'Tis a great pity that I am dead 
<start>Or that you have the power 
<start>To undo me through my sleep, 
<start>Or that you lack the power 
<start>To undo me through this night, 
<start>A heart which I do adore 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>With your sad face, 
<start>For it is such a good girl, 
<start>But the dear ones keep me away. 
<start>Her face is fair and bright, 
<start>And the sun shines low, 
<start>But the dear ones keep me away here, 
<start>And the stars shine high. 
<start>Her eyes are such a light, 
<start>They keep me in sight 
<start>On all the hills and woodlands fair, 
<start>But she would rather stay here, 
<start>Where the stars shine high. 
<start>I must not lie there lonely, 
<start>Nor stay here lonely, 
<start>Nor leave here lonely, 
<start>For the dear ones keep me away here 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And all the world would weep. 
<start>He was a great big good horse, redbreast; 
<start>He was built like a dragonfly; 
<start>He could ride in the mud and the sand, 
<start>But he never hurt a calf. 
<start>He ran through the grass and the rushes 
<start>And then he went away, 
<start>It was all a blur he couldn't see 
<start>When he came back to shore. 
<start>When the mavis sings, he is loud and he cries, 
<start>O God, how we are scared! 
<start>When the cricket flutters around us, 
<start>Oh, our feet are covered with flowers, we are 
<start>As we were born! 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>In a world of pain and doubt; 
<start>Of you and me and all your tears, 
<start>With grief and doubt and loneliness; 
<start>All that, so bright and young and brave, 
<start>All that, so bright and young and brave, 
<start>Sings across the sky and sings 
<start>Of you and me and all your tears, 
<start>To-day and to-night, 
<start>Is all that we in this wide sea 
<start>Do sing of you and all your tears. 
<start>In the world of pain and doubt, 
<start>In the world of loss and strife, 
<start>In the world of hope and pain, 
<start>When you lie dreaming and dreaming, 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>You would call 'em. But they are good; 
<start>Their blood is red with love, love is red, 
<start>That's why they are so sweet. 
<start>So they come and come I am not sure, 
<start>He's grown to manhood's manhood's boy again, 
<start>And then you'll say their kisses blow 
<start>As you kissed your sweet new girl. 
<start>And then you'll cry with shame 
<start>Your pretty sweet new lady! 
<start>She is so fair and so soft, 
<start>So pretty to my eyes. 
<start>She must have her wings and she must have her feet, 
<start>She is so sweet to my feet. 
<start>All the little little flowers 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>It's all too long ago  
<start>You've been to a fair and fair and fair 
<start>My little book and my heart  
<start>And never for two short years 
<start>Will I forget. Though I've tried to read 
<start>'Twas hard and too long ago  
<start>Yet you can always tell 
<start>A story of delight and pain  
<start>A story of my love and how. 
<start>You can tell, no doubt, 
<start>How far through the day the moonlight crept 
<start>'Twas like a dream's eclipse,  
<start>And when all was still I sat on the beach, 
<start>And all around I looked to see 
<start>The little
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>That is the star of the coming day. 
<start>Your love, my love, is true 
<start>When I come home again: 
<start>Only on the cross so white 
<start>Can you show kindness. 
<start>My love, my love, is true, 
<start>I come home again; 
<start>Because my love is blind, 
<start>And all other days he sees 
<start>He sees it not with eyes. 
<start>My love, my love, is true 
<start>When I come home again: 
<start>Only on the cross so white 
<start>Can you show kindness. 
<start>And you shall have the strength 
<start>To save me from the heat of your smile. 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And how those hands have made you feel; 
<start>When we are grown to manhood's size, 
<start>The world is fair yet is full of strife  
<start>The world would not have us here 
<start>Were it not for you to know us well, 
<start>Your eyes would light us up and smile. 
<start>When we are young and fair and good, 
<start>We are taught to love you and to care. 
<start>When we reach that realm where every man 
<start>Is welcome as he went before, 
<start>And there we worship God's high Lord, who said 
<start>From far away 
<start>To all nations that might come 
<start>And worship thee, 
<start>Then the
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>That I had to read you there, 
<start>You are a great musician and a poet, 
<start>A great painter, and a wise man, 
<start>Some say, of very young age. 
<start>You must be going to Cambridge 
<start>For your studies, for your thoughts, 
<start>For the songs that I have made 
<start>Of you in love and you in tears. 
<start>Dear sister, I hope you will not 
<start>Be afraid, of course, or heedful 
<start>To this advice of your brother, 
<start>Though he may be so weak and wise, 
<start>He shall never look for pleasure 
<start>In what I tell him that yearning 
<start>For your play and
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>When they heard their mother call 
<start>To them:  I love thee, mother, 
<start>I love thee, mother, 
<start>How shall I be lost in tears? 
<start>So they lay on the dale, 
<start>And to their hearts did go, 
<start>And sweet the morn and sweet the day, 
<start>And gentle was the cry, 
<start>And soft the gale across the waters, 
<start>And soft the morn upon the blue. 
<start>And when they rose again 
<start>And to their homes did go, 
<start>The sisters all together heard, 
<start>And in their hearts a joy was born, 
<start>To see the little maiden 
<start>On the
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And then my pulses start. 
<start>Oh, dear that day I'm in yonder town! 
<start>There it is! And it's in the old year, 
<start>The old year in its hour of bloom, 
<start>How you and I together came 
<start>Through the wood and the meadow! 
<start>We went to a little village 
<start>On our knees, my dear, I think so; 
<start>And to walk with you and go beside you 
<start>I wish that I never did! 
<start>But I'm sure they're wrong; and the trees they're wrong, 
<start>And the birds are wrong, too! 
<start>O, little boys dear, you never will look so gay, 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>When they met her at a wedding-day, 
<start>And each day to another's eye 
<start>Fled like a cloud. 
<start>One evening in the garden fair, 
<start>Each in his hand a book that lay, 
<start>And his head he bound with all his might, 
<start>With all his might: 
<start>He tore all for it, as he read, - 
<start>The Book said to his friends, she's blind - 
<start>To the blind books he came and went - 
<start>Where the light was red and the light was white, 
<start>To the blind books he drove and turned. 
<start>Then she spake out, There is a dark and great 
<start>Oft she spake
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>As a little child, 
<start>If I never could have got you 
<start>And ever you were not mine. 
<start>My heart aches about a little boy, 
<start>His mother said 
<start>To me just now, and says to me, 
<start>Your father has gone. 
<start>My heart aches very sorely about you, 
<start>Her mother's words to say  
<start>The little boy had died in a war. 
<start>I go down into the deep blue deep. 
<start>I find him sleeping close to me 
<start>And I know that his mother understands. 
<start>My father told me about her grave, 
<start>The little boy died late. 
<start>You
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>Where are your fancies, who is going your way? 
<start>And though you see the same old faces, 
<start>And hear the same old voices, 
<start>My thoughts are no longer of the years, 
<start>But rather of the things which are, 
<start>Of what we were not and can be. 
<start>I should like to do my very best. 
<start>I could give you a place in my place; 
<start>I could give you a house that is my own, 
<start>I could give you an abode in your dwelling, 
<start>Wherein I dwell; and I should like to hold them 
<start>And live again ere long. 
<start>I have dreamed 
<start>Of my dear
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>For the sake of a friend; 
<start>We are happy both. 
<start>To be a poet is a matter which cannot be explained in 
<start>no sense if we would find out 
<start>For ourselves, at any time of year, in the world of words which 
<start>have no means of interpretation. 
<start>There is no word which cannot be understood as containing a number 
<start>pieces or as being arranged in groups or in blocks of blocks of 
<start>A.  M.  I've given, with the exception of the second-class and second-tier compositions, the 
<start>preferments of that literary system I am unable to show upon the 
<start>submitting 
<start>the two poets. These poems are not so different as the
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>When she came back from her bed; 
<start>It was so sad and heavy, 
<start>It was so sad and heavy yet. 
<start>'Twas dark, 'twas dark below us, 
<start>And far away the stars gleamed like fire; 
<start>No moon stood up as if by dawns blown down. 
<start>What is the matter! He replied, 
<start>I pray you tell us a story 
<start>A long time ago, and it's true 
<start>It is a thing which has been told, 
<start>And was to my children's long-lost ones, 
<start>And told so oft at last. 
<start>I had dreamed the moon was far away, 
<start>She looked upon the earth;
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>As you went to bed and nothing done. 
<start>We all are thinking of you to-day, 
<start>And I only think of you so long, 
<start>And yet, oh I wish he'd come back, 
<start>And see his face again on you. 
<start>I hate to think this man is fair, 
<start>This man my friend at table seen  
<start>He's such a wizened thing to me 
<start>I never should have loved him more. 
<start>But I know that he is loved, for he has gone 
<start>To tell me that there's little need, I think, 
<start>For a new home, and a quiet place, and love, 
<start>And a wife with all the
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>There is something in your eyes, 
<start>A touch, within me, I can feel 
<start>For all the tears I shed for you. 
<start>They fall upon my memory, dear, 
<start>Though for my sake they may fall 
<start>They say that I can neither weep, 
<start>Nor pity you nor sorrow for you. 
<start>And so, for that dear sake of you, 
<start>And so, for me, I mourn for you. 
<start>A little word you used to say: 
<start>I shall not know the day I'll pass 
<start>Unless you bring me here some little hand, 
<start>Or bid me take me in my arms 
<start>And tie the threads around my hair; 
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>And I yearn for the soft caress 
<start>Of your soft eyes, soft lips that are blue 
<start>With the tears from your eyes, 
<start>And a little heart of my own 
<start>That is tender and warm as yours 
<start>As I kiss and caress you. 
<start>All my dreams of my heart are dead 
<start>And all my dreams of beauty are gone; 
<start>I lie in my room and dream and dream 
<start>And I sit still and dream and dream; 
<start>And you are the only life that I know, 
<start>And all my dreams lie in your dreams. 
<start>I was tired of the moonlight, and tired of the wind and the rain, 
<start>And
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>In that lonely place there in yon place 
<start>Where they must kneel a while to weep; 
<start>And I looked there alone and cried, 
<start>And it came again to mind. 
<start>And a strange light went out; 
<start>And I thought it lay 
<start>Through the misty morning sky; 
<start>And the stars went out. 
<start>How many dead to-day 
<start>Is the light of your dear eyes? Ah yes, 
<start>The stars go out and you never come back: 
<start>How many dead with me in yon place, 
<start>Where they must kneel with pity and pray 
<start>To the silent one who prayed for me for you, 
<start>And I
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>Both we and we must part: 
<start>I, you, and I together; 
<start>You, I, shall part again. 
<start>It was the early days there, 
<start>And then I saw you near, 
<start>I knew, within my heart, 
<start>How I'd love you so, and miss 
<start>Our father's image there. 
<start>How sweet it was for father's sake, 
<start>How grand to him I fell! 
<start>How often must we part, if ever 
<start>We were of kindred blood. 
<start>They kissed but I could not, and 
<start>And, as he saw how they tried, 
<start>In vain they tried to say no word 
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>To fit your mind; it is more than you will 
<start>Assured of happiness from this day 
<start>When I shall have it. 
<start>I am not fond of books, nor yet of books 
<start>I will not say how far they are to me. 
<start>They are the truest, and most noble things, 
<start>And, even as all my poets I admire, 
<start>I am glad to believe that books are made 
<start>Because I think they are. I think them sweet, 
<start>And grateful to see them as they are. I think 
<start>That they are a joy to be taught. They are pleasant, sweet, 
<start>And they are not as all the world knows them! 
<start>They
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>But as the years roll on, 
<start>I have seen a thousand other times, 
<start>And you have seen a single one. 
<start>In a great war, 
<start>They were two great nations one; 
<start>All the names in the world 
<start>By far and few had one. 
<start>The names that were but one  
<start>In a great world, 
<start>In a great world, 
<start>The names that were but one; 
<start>The names to love and fight against, 
<start>For your sake and mine, 
<start>Were but two names. 
<start>Now, since this tale 
<start>Was published, I must tell you 
<start>That what
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>As though I were making fun of you. I know it, 
<start>But still! and never do this more than I did. 
<start>The book may be, my muse, quite idle and vain, 
<start>The words may have an awkward and unpleasant sound, 
<start>You understand the use of rhyming, yet, there's your choice. 
<start>The subject's not a matter of a doubt. 
<start>A young writer of the very kind you hail 
<start>It is worth taking heed to note he has no wife 
<start>That he may make a fool of me for all his pains. 
<start>He has to sell his money, or pay up, if you please; 
<start>And there's nothing he can give to pay him to do you any
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>As you and I! 
<start>I'm fainted here for fear. 
<start>The loon is guttering away at last  
<start>That he's dead, but there he lies 
<start>Laden with stars and sea-foam. 
<start>All night my body's reeling and trembling  
<start>The moonbeams gleam in my hair. 
<start>I'm fainted here for fear. 
<start>I don't know who I am, or where, or when  
<start>I'd better hurry by and hug 
<start>Those blue-dyed lilies there! 
<start>I dare not believe in the strange old sorcery 
<start>That makes the world a lonely paradise 
<start>Where I am not. 
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>In childhood's sunny days; 
<start>I long for the kiss that you gave me 
<start>When we met the sun. 
<start>When I was happy I could not 
<start>Laugh at your love and laughter, 
<start>But still you seemed to me 
<start>To say: You love me, love me. 
<start>When you were old and old and gray, 
<start>I said to myself: You know 
<start>That my true love is always here, 
<start>And his love I loved is ever true. 
<start>He never comes back. Never comes back. 
<start>He says: My love is always here. 
<start>I love him for my face. 
<start>In his house he keeps
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>And for all your eyes that gaze on me; 
<start>And I can only wonder, if 
<start>That you would never, never see how 
<start>I am weaving this tale of love 
<start>With all these lovely, heavenly forms, 
<start>Of love, and love, and love to you. 
<start>You see, I say, this letter 
<start>As of old from his father. 
<start>And you see at least one of the 
<start>Twelve letters 
<start>Sounded through his ears as the old man 
<start>Stretched on the grave. 
<start>But your eyes never moved, 
<start>For the letter was a dream. 
<start>The poet sat by the grave. 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>Until the day began  
<start>So much it makes our happiness so brief, I said. 
<start>It's like it ever seems. I know you are; 
<start>You are not much to me, you know; 
<start>You are like a moth; you fly; 
<start>But you are still the same. You are true  
<start>You cannot change, but I must. 
<start>Sometimes you say, You are very fair; 
<start>But I know that you are not fair. 
<start>I want you to be your lover, 
<start>To find each love-sick man sweet 
<start>When we are one alone. Love makes you so 
<start>Your pretty friend, my friend, 
<start>You are a little
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>Who never need the other men; 
<start>I have taken a great and tender strain, 
<start>And sing of the days and the pains 
<start>That were, and the bright ones that will be, 
<start>And the songs that I shall have to repeat. 
<start>And I love the songs, the songs that are sung 
<start>For the sake of a brother.  There's something else, 
<start>Something new in the life to be remembered, 
<start>Something old in the glory to be won; 
<start>Something old in the song to be sung in rhyme. 
<start>We are all dreaming that we may have peace 
<start>For the past that is gone astray, 
<start>For the time that has come out of
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>When they heard they were near. 
<start>They were glad, they were glad 
<start>When they had felt so dear; 
<start>They did not see the tear-drop fall 
<start>On the face of that dear May. 
<start>What would they say? 
<start>They would not let her in; 
<start>She would not let them go. 
<start>What would they say? 
<start>They would not stay at home 
<start>To see the sun through the trees; 
<start>All they saw was the sun, 
<start>On the ground as they lay. 
<start>What would they say? 
<start>What have they known? 
<start>They were far away, 
<start>And were far
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>When the light comes over the seas, 
<start>And my own heart to the ocean is fed, 
<start>To have you so to rest. 
<start>For now, farewell, my love, farewell! 
<start>Oh, the stars are fair, and I know 
<start>That they may see you at home! 
<start>For though day is gone, my love, farewell, 
<start>To have you so to rest! 
<start>Oh, the stars are fair, and I know 
<start>That they may see you at home! 
<start>Dear, my dear, farewell, your love, farewell! 
<start>Ah, dear, I miss you once while I lay here; 
<start>You're sad and cold, my dear, for ever
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And the old man was mad as hell he was mad, 
<start>And a lance that would go right up in the sky, 
<start>But the lance dropped in in the air. 
<start>It fell on a young lad that had to run, 
<start>There was a black man beside him lying, 
<start>'Why are you here? why are you not here?' 
<start>The black man said 'Mother, I must get home.' 
<start>And I took the lance and he took the lance again; 
<start>I had to run that one to death to get home.' 
<start>The youth sprang up over the tree, and ran, and dropped; 
<start>The lance fell in the ground, and fell in the ground, 
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>Together; and the king himself 
<start>Saw her coming, and his heart 
<start>Was at its fever, and his mind 
<start>Stood sick for his own daughter, whom 
<start>She saw unquietly. 
<start>So at length with words of love 
<start>They spoke to one another, 
<start>The one to the other saying, 
<start>She will never wed me, I 
<start>Am not as far as you,  
<start>A woman, O my child, I hear you cry! 
<start>And as the woman cried, 
<start>She strove to keep away her cries, 
<start>And was afraid of the cry, 
<start>She prayed not to win love's blessing   
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>Of her dear sister, 
<start>In the twilight hour 
<start>When I am old and lonely, 
<start>When I look on 
<start>The face I loved so long, 
<start>Ere the dawn had crowned her 
<start>With its radiance 
<start>That her heart could feel no sorrow, 
<start>She had not found 
<start>Another name to praise her. 
<start>Her face that grew so young 
<start>I could not see nor hear it, 
<start>Its sweetness and its grace, 
<start>Was a vision that she had, 
<start>And seemed 
<start>As though a vision to her heart and mind. 
<start>There was but one image left 
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>And the warmth of your word: 
<start>For the warm sun of your smile 
<start>I long for your silent and passionate look, 
<start>And for you, that be the day, 
<start>I long for the love of your silence, 
<start>And for you, from noon till night. 
<start>I long for that sweet night the tears to flow; 
<start>For the sweet eyes of the dawn to look on, 
<start>And for you, that be the night; 
<start>For you, that be the day at heart, 
<start>And the sweet night of my tears. 
<start>I long for the smile of your smile, 
<start>For you, that be the night, 
<start>For me, a
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>For the sake of my heart from the heart of an 
<start>Achaean man I've been to a banquet for an 
<start>Achaean man, a banquet for a noble 
<start>Achaean, son. But if I can but make you 
<start>A palace, then I shall go on by sea  
<start>Go with me, go with me in a sea deep. 
<start>I am writting this poem for you. 
<start>My heart is like a little star, 
<start>It shines in dimples on the sea, 
<start>And its beams are like a woman's golden hair 
<start>When she goes down to bed in her 
<start>In her nightingale's dream. 
<start>So
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And what I will do for you, 
<start>Now let me live by duty and meekness 
<start>By the light of the sun, and you 
<start>All that are my love in the face of fate, 
<start>With your glad little eyes 
<start>And your beautiful little hair, 
<start>Oh! what my heart is waiting for, 
<start>For this dear little man of mine, 
<start>And his home by my side, like a king 
<start>With a queen in white; 
<start>Oh! what my soul is longing for, 
<start>Not a kingdom above, 
<start>That I might have you in my arms 
<start>Or a home on this earth, 
<start>Then I would have
<start>I am writting this poem for you
<start>As the world's best poets do. 
<start>The wind with the wild-throb of her breath 
<start>Away and away; 
<start>The night with the cold, the dew 
<start>In the light rain falling; 
<start>And the wind with the wild thrush's shrill cry, 
<start>As it passes, to me more sweet: 
<start>In the world's best poet, but the poet's best? 
<start>Oh! I am awed with the wild, the wild and the wild 
<start>Throbbing to go 
<start>From the sun a little while; 
<start>In the world's best poet the winds are out of tune with the night; 
<start>The night's wild song comes to me
<start>They were mad and in love
<start>And went before us. 
<start>But the song's a tale  
<start>The heart is weary, not in love, 
<start>Not in sorrow  
<start>Thin in the shadows of the night, 
<start>But in the light of the night. 
<start>She is weary, weary of all 
<start>The glory that was with her. 
<start>She cannot rest until the day 
<start>She has been dead for so long. 
<start>She sees the night behind the wall, 
<start>And feels the wind with the darkness cold, 
<start>He does not think of her when he dies, 
<start>And she knows not his death. 
<start>Alas! he would not have it so, 
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>And all night long they lay alone 
<start>Pillow-deep asleep in his bed. 
<start>And one told him that his mother 
<start>Came from out the wood to lay 
<start>Gasping his mother's pale blue eyes, 
<start>Looking out at twilight, drearily 
<start>With face up to the stars and air, 
<start>And that he knew her well, and knew 
<start>That the child beneath the moon was there, 
<start>And she would answer him. 
<start>And one told him that the sea was there, 
<start>As deep as he had dreamed 
<start>He went down, and he saw its light 
<start>Came from the sea and sea was there. 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>The one I left behind. 
<start>You were a darling, and all things, 
<start>And you loved me well, 
<start>My little, white, little Rose;  
<start>We grew to love, we did not part, 
<start>We never parted yet. 
<start>Our little Rose had a kind, 
<start>We do not know how she liked; 
<start>She could not see from whence or why 
<start>Her own thoughts came and went. 
<start>It was, in short, a pleasant day, 
<start>And her eyes were fixed in mine, 
<start>And my heart, a little, bright, bright bird, 
<start>Flew up to view her. 
<start>A little,
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>As the night is turning round, 
<start>For I know that you are young and fair, 
<start>And my heart aches not for you,  
<start>Though the years have gone by and passed, 
<start>And the days have waxed, and my feet are tired, 
<start>And my heart aches not for you,  
<start>Yet my heart aches just thinking of you 
<start>As the night is turning round. 
<start>For I want your love, dear brother; 
<start>For I know what love is worth, 
<start>And the love of your heart is dear, 
<start>And my heart aches not for you, dear brother. 
<start>But when we're going out I fear 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And all the things that your heart has told  
<start>I only know your voice is sweet  
<start>So calm that no one can tell it 
<start>How dear you are to me and you, 
<start>So kind and tender as your hand  
<start>They might kiss and be glad or sore  
<start>I never knew all love could bring 
<start>When I am lonely and you are dead. 
<start>I think you will be there when I am still; 
<start>For I am only you or you, I will see you, 
<start>For there seems little difference between 
<start>A kiss of mine and the kiss on your hand, 
<start>And no one asks me what I think of you. 
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>And the sound of your feet. 
<start>The night is cold and the winds are still, 
<start>The moon is far and faint, 
<start>The shadows are hushed, the wind is still, 
<start>The sun is still and bright. 
<start>I long for the sunshine, the air is fair, 
<start>But of yore the stars are black; 
<start>The stars rise from the west and the east, 
<start>But of yore my heart is gray. 
<start>I long for the moonbeams that float 
<start>In the sky above me, 
<start>But of yore I have lost all trace, 
<start>The moon has dropped like a drop o' salt, 
<start>And the sea
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And your love for a week. 
<start>My heart is sad as a grave, 
<start>I have found nothing to cheer it, 
<start>I have gone into sleep, 
<start>But my heart, like a broken link, 
<start>Tears from my soul I must pierce, 
<start>I must pierce, but they are a part 
<start>Of the world I love, the way 
<start>I see them where they fall, 
<start>In the bright sunshine of my breast, 
<start>In the sunlight of my soul! 
<start>I can hear the rain 
<start>In the sky 
<start>Sweeping the woods 
<start>Over me, 
<start>In the twilight, 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you
<start>And hearing my tears so near you! 
<start>My heart aches just thinking of you. 
<start>I never can find the home 
<start>Where I can trust my own true love; 
<start>My soul I only know in dreams 
<start>But no one in yon little town. 
<start>That I might walk the streets again 
<start>And feel the earth around me shake 
<start>And say, My heart aches just thinking of you. 
<start>No one else can know in yon little town. 
<start>No one else can love in yon little town. 
<start>My heart, if earth itself is there, 
<start>Is in that heart so true to me, 
<start>And I know where my own
<start>They were lonely and tired
<start>Just after supper time. 
<start>There we sat all alone in the twilight; 
<start>Tired, I must say, at night. 
<start>They talked as much of their pleasures as 
<start>Of their dreams, they talked of their cares: 
<start>Then we came into the garden, 
<start>Where we sat still and still, and we 
<start>Hang up forlorn, and we cannot say 
<start>Much of the joyous things we dreamed; 
<start>There were two maidens sitting up 
<start>With her head upon their shoulders, 
<start>And the first girl was very tall,  
<start>And the second so much of the joyous things she dreamed. 
<start>Then we met at the garden-gate,
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>And love of your heart! 
<start>Oh! the thought of you is the dream of a soul  
<start>Of a soul in a soul  
<start>In the long-drawn line of eternity  
<start>Suffering a soul's decay! 
<start>I have long been thinking for the light of your face  
<start>The glory of those eyes! 
<start>You have said that the soul is a dream of a soul  
<start>That is strong as a throne 
<start>And the love of the earth is true, 
<start>But I love the love of the stars who lighten them 
<start>For you and me! 
<start>Let a word of my thought pass in your thought, 
<start>Let me turn
<start>I long for the warmth of your smile
<start>When I feel you pass your lips. 
<start>But, oh! my heart is sick. 
<start>For I forget what the old woods have known  
<start>The things that were always new. 
<start>It is not till you bring your face again 
<start>How the sweetest things will do - 
<start>I know that you are not one of the saddest. 
<start>Do not tell me, dear, I know it! 
<start>I know that my heart shall never break. 
<start>When you were here, you knew me 
<start>By you, like a God. 
<start>So, when I am gone, what I have known 
<start>Would be a lie 
<start>To lie to you. For you
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>To hear thy little feet depart? 
<start>We must rest, we must leave thee there, 
<start>Thy little ones, alone, 
<start>But we will not part with thee, 
<start>For those old hands have pressed thee there; 
<start>All things to thee are given, 
<start>Save that thou art always here, 
<start>And all things are given in vain. 
<start>Let them that cannot mourn 
<start>Let them from me depart; 
<start>I am but a child, 
<start>And I have been before thou art, 
<start>And one with many years; 
<start>Let them weep thy woe, while others weep, 
<start>Then let them weep again. 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>As life to dream to-night, 
<start>The little heart that holds the heart to-night 
<start>With all the joys that are, 
<start>And where that heart is, the light of the sun 
<start>Is gone before my eyes. 
<start>The sun went down. 
<start>I thought in secret of my dreams 
<start>My friends were gone. 
<start>My dream in silence seemed 
<start>To say that I am lost 
<start>Who could not find their ways to be 
<start>In this new world. 
<start>But on the brightening day 
<start>I found them out, by no sign of fear, 
<start>And all the ways of God were known 
<start>Without
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>that will twine its leaves about the door of Time, 
<start>all flowers that you ever will see, and the rain! 
<start>Then you'll hear me talking with you 
<start>behind the doorway to my room, and the little 
<start>little birds will be singing to hear me, 
<start>and the big waves will be singing at my door, and they will 
<start>speak of the rain 
<start>that will come down from above 
<start>and my heart is breaking with the thought  
<start>Of the long, dark night 
<start>that may come as the wind has blown 
<start>to me, and my child will be sleeping 
<start>in the green earth when the rain beats. 
<start>So I sit in my little
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>with branches of bright olive branches and of 
<start>water-colour of palm. 
<start>I have heard a tale told a tale 
<start>of a man who was not born in the year of the 
<start>first circle. 
<start>He met an old man, and said to him: 
<start>This old man shall bear thee. 
<start>He looked into my eyes, he asked: 
<start>And I replied: 
<start>This old man shall keep thy love for ever, 
<start>and I shall hold thee as mother. 
<start>The sun came upon me like a cloud 
<start>upon a mountain, 
<start>and I looked within my eyes and I saw 
<start>the face of the first circle as it shone.
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>When roses wither in the spring; 
<start>And, as they gather round her bower, 
<start>The flowery bowers of Noli rise, 
<start>In graceful, white procession ring, 
<start>And each soft hand invites the guest; 
<start>The young, the old with mien to cheer, 
<start>With simple accents greet the child. 
<start>She sits at noon, among the flowers, 
<start>In simple, white procession ring; 
<start>As gentle as the day she rose, 
<start>She treads her gentle footsteps down, 
<start>As gentle as the moon she passed. 
<start>The birds begin to sing and fly 
<start>Her gentle footsteps down; 
<start>The flowers
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>That I am lost, alone. God knows, 
<start>If I shall come, I will go,  
<start>And I will die of shame and shame, 
<start>The death of woman, shame and shame. 
<start>But not from my bosom I would hide 
<start>Its burning light and light of hope; 
<start>For love would never rise to shine 
<start>Without the love of her who died 
<start>For a lost form on the breast of God. 
<start>My only hope that love may move 
<start>Is a dream of joy to follow 
<start>And a deathless look to be 
<start>To be the face on the face of the world. 
<start>I will not forsake thee in thy dream
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than when a man should pass the room in silence. 
<start>Oh, you who came, I can scarce bear the news! 
<start>I almost feel sorry I must go away. 
<start>For all I can in this I must keep alive; 
<start>I must go to the garden again to sleep, 
<start>I must bring books and bring love to my friends, 
<start>I must bring my beautiful little lady home, 
<start>The time I think I shall never see again. 
<start>But as she drew her curtain slowly down the hall, 
<start>And looked about to see if she could find a chair, 
<start>And saw the little bed a bed of straw and flowers, 
<start>Then, with a smile, she went
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>Itself must be.  To lose it were the worst 
<start>Of mortal human misery. 
<start>She passed the door 
<start>With anxious eyes; the woman paused: 
<start>It was too late; the door was open. 
<start>I took her face, and whispered, Here, 
<start>Hear me, young friend.  This is not 
<start>My dream; she answered, The door is wide, 
<start>She knows not what she feels, and must not know. 
<start>She rose.  Suddenly she said, Here! 
<start>Dare you hear me, do not fear her? 
<start>So he shook his head.  Now let us have the key! 
<start>She took the key; and down
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>For the dead to return again, 
<start>Nor turn to the grave and weep, 
<start>I would have my prayers be answered. 
<start>No, a new spirit I shall bring 
<start>To the world to welcome me home 
<start>When the stars are shining in the sky 
<start>I shall be a Spirit of peace. 
<start>I will follow the moon's silver light 
<start>To the world far away; 
<start>I shall bring the rain into the light, 
<start>And the shadow of the moon there on the rock. 
<start>My little little spirit I'll try 
<start>To lift above me, 
<start>And I'll teach its mother all 
<start>That I have taught her to learn;
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>For pain or any sin, 
<start>Do not stand near my side, 
<start>And pray for comfort. 
<start>Let the sweet flowers go home, 
<start>For the spring is come anon, 
<start>And I will sleep on my grave, 
<start>And my tears shall flow. 
<start>While on our earth I lie, 
<start>Loving alone, 
<start>Oh, the stars will shine on the hill, 
<start>On the stream, and the plain! 
<start>So the old sweet poet lies 
<start>A little under the snow, 
<start>In dreams of his long-lost days; 
<start>The stars stand still, 
<start>Like stars of the great heart, 
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than wine divine. 
<start>'And I will not forget   
<start>I will find what I was dreaming of that night 
<start>I watched the wild deer on the mountain side, 
<start>There gleamed a rose bush that shone like a gem. 
<start>I was happy, and that rose bush was mine, 
<start>It was a rose bush by the mountain side   
<start>And I knew she was mine: it was a rose bush. 
<start>She was a rose bush a tree with a leaf so red, 
<start>I thought I could see its buds, and its green tips. 
<start>But a wild bird came singing across the air 
<start>Like a leaf upon a tree-bough, flying away,
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>sheltered in a sheltered shady lane. 
<start>In each leaf is his dear father's face, 
<start>and his heart is beating in my breast. 
<start>I sit beside him all alone 
<start>in the leafy forest-heath! 
<start>He comes and sits by me. 
<start>In the far woods he's playing 
<start>with his harp and his pipe. 
<start>His eyes are sad and sad, 
<start>his heart is heavy and still. 
<start>The winds blow wild and soft, 
<start>and wind and rain 
<start>and the stars are near at hand; 
<start>I know his voice. I hear his singing 
<start>of the sea, 
<start>for
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>that grows from the white wave's sweep 
<start>of a grassy hill, 
<start>And the white-crested larch is where it grew 
<start>as once it did, 
<start>But from the tender white-crested larch, 
<start>and the red 
<start>trees in the forest's bosom, 
<start>and the trees in the hill. 
<start>This is the root of the white-crested larch 
<start>and the red that grows at the foot of the hill, 
<start>And the sweet scent of honey among 
<start>the bushes; 
<start>Where the white-crested larch hangs like a red rose 
<start>scented with blossoms on the spray;
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>Before the dawn: 
<start>'Tis summer, Summer, and the lark 
<start>Falls from her branches deep, 
<start>Comes murmuring, from her cot and bed, 
<start>Pierces with her song. 
<start>How sweet a spring of beauty is 
<start>In such a quiet tomb! 
<start>Though leaves are falling, like the wind, 
<start>The day-star's clear beam; 
<start>And every light, by reason of its power, 
<start>Hath touched so many a scene; 
<start>Yet, in the very depths of beauty's face 
<start>The light lies pure, dear-smell'd, 
<start>How bright! it seems  
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than the bitter grape! 
<start>But, if, after all, you've ever drank and watched, 
<start>Just as it happens, with all your wit, 
<start>A girl comes in to say, This drink is good? 
<start>But if you only had a bottle to fill, 
<start>And a bottle's not a draught, 
<start>And you're young, the girl will let it pass, 
<start>It's just a draught she got from Jack. 
<start>He had just the same idea, and now 
<start>I'm just tired of making tea. 
<start>His cup is full, so Jack is ready; he'll go 
<start>And wash it with a rag in this new-made wash; 
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>Where the long spring-time in green weeds 
<start>Leaves a drowsy green after a year, 
<start>Nor a flower nor leaf leaves its fruit, 
<start>Till the year comes on like a mist, 
<start>And all is a summer's night. 
<start>The summer time, when no one stirs 
<start>The tree, or hears it sing at all, 
<start>Wakes the leafy branches, shrilling: 
<start>And the summer time, when birds are singing 
<start>Over the blue of the grass, 
<start>Eats and drinks not again; 
<start>Till all the trees are gone. 
<start>The autumn time, when autumn wind blows, 
<start>Leaves all the leaves gray
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>When in a forest green the bamboos bloom. 
<start>Heaven knows that, at night, her love is cold; 
<start>Heaven knows how frail her beauty lies; 
<start>She sits so still and sweet and still 
<start>O'er the tender tender waters she lays. 
<start>Her limbs are frail and stiff and white, 
<start>She is grown up to be a wistful thing. 
<start>She knows the silence of the stars; 
<start>The twilight of the night. 
<start>She is frail and shy enough to weep 
<start>The tears she shed for Him whose love was spent  
<start>Thy feet have heard the soft voice of God! 
<start>The tears of love for Christ were vain,
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than wine, I trust, can do; 
<start>Yet, Lord, they are not worth 
<start>All the worth of wine. 
<start>But do not speak on my side! Oh pray 
<start>That I may keep them in their place, 
<start>But not let them waste them there; 
<start>The spirit can not tell the shame. 
<start>It will not do, Lord, to speak 
<start>Between the lips, 
<start>Though it be such a bitter sound; 
<start>But it is better to be dead, 
<start>Than to lie, Lord, at God's feet. 
<start>The heart was with us, the hand was left, 
<start>Through all the world away; 
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>For me in vain. 
<start>Forget the day at eventide 
<start>When I might see my darling die, 
<start>And see the grave where he lay: 
<start>The tears at the sad hour are rare, 
<start>But the breathless hands that he gave. 
<start>Be patient where your footsteps tread, 
<start>Never to lose his love so true: 
<start>And keep your hope and your will true, 
<start>Never to waste your own again. 
<start>Ah, mother of my child, remember 
<start>A year's joy when thou didst not know 
<start>That at the first dawn I called my darling, 
<start>For so true you were to me at first. 
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>For my lost one's loss, 
<start>For the one who has passed so long 
<start>And mourns for him still. 
<start>Come and take one flower for my feet 
<start>If I can sing my song 
<start>Or I can only weep with you 
<start>When the flowers die and fall, 
<start>The flowers die and fall, 
<start>And the earth hath no more life. 
<start>I can sing, so I have willed, 
<start>I can sing with you; 
<start>And I have been to sorrow alone 
<start>When the years roll slow. 
<start>Come and bring me one flower for my feet, 
<start>If I can sing in my breath  
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than I do: or such I give, or else not much, 
<start>And you have better eyes for eyes like mine. 
<start>The man that loves to be himself a dog 
<start>And loves to do things he finds much vex'd, 
<start>Yet loves more than will my words to prove 
<start>His own dear self, he says, by his delight. 
<start>Or say, Why, not a dog but one myself 
<start>Must go about the world, if I can, as you will. 
<start>I'd rather not think that I could bear to find 
<start>The one who's love me, than think I was not love. 
<start>I think I must suppose I am the only one at all, 
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>And mourn too long, my lost, and die! 
<start>There are so many sorrows, 
<start>I cannot say that there are none 
<start>Of a better life I ever had. 
<start>Away! away! for I would fly 
<start>Into the blue sea of death. 
<start>There is no God, 
<start>There is no God but God alone, 
<start>And who can live out His day? 
<start>Oh, give me, then, a thousand years! 
<start>And, when I die, a thousand years! 
<start>How shall I live again? It is not right 
<start>At all that I should yield 
<start>To your cold hand and cold eye 
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than I who can't make butter for myself, 
<start>For I can't make butter for myself, or myself. 
<start>He looked with thoughtful purpose on the door, 
<start>And when he turned, he found a small, white book 
<start>In a corner of the corner under her arm, 
<start>Gathered in a bundle that looked a wreath: 
<start>A book of books, some hundred and fifty lines, 
<start>But the title it was only that it looked a book: 
<start>It was a book of books under her arm. 
<start>He opened the book; and all her life was bright and clear 
<start>As the light of morning over her eyes. 
<start>All that she read was nothing much above
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>In the middle of the woods; 
<start>The wind does never say Good-by. 
<start>It is the springtime of autumn. 
<start>With purple and gold are leaves, 
<start>With silken, lily-green. 
<start>In the springtime is the morning, 
<start>When the red leaves are falling; 
<start>When the air is rich with snow, 
<start>And the wind gives a merry note. 
<start>You must be very quiet here, 
<start>For the leaves are singing in play; 
<start>When the sun shines on the woodlands, 
<start>You must be very quiet. 
<start>You must have no clothes at all, 
<start>For the grass is heavy. 
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>Till life return again.' 
<start>She turned to him.  'O yes, Sir, 
<start>I thank you for your gentle heart. - 
<start>The world has made me glad for my love - 
<start>And I am thankful that you know.' 
<start>She spoke the story to him as he rose 
<start>And put the letter aside. 
<start>He gave him a pen across his cheek, 
<start>And she gave him a book - 
<start>The name of his beloved. 
<start>And she took him by the hand 
<start>And gave him a little box, 
<start>With a little red-patterboard in it, 
<start>And a little sign she'd like 
<start>To
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>And robed in gold. 
<start>Her looks are like the sea, and all 
<start>Her beauty is, 
<start>In all her gentle charms 
<start>Forgetting all care of men. 
<start>Her face is pale, like one 
<start>Who has slept for long in gloom, 
<start>Yet not so pale 
<start>That she, at early dawn, 
<start>Would think the darkness over. 
<start>Her head is like an ivory casket 
<start>Set down by the sea. 
<start>She smiles on me; she listens by my side 
<start>While I write, 
<start>A little while, 
<start>To think that the world is still the same 
<start>The
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>Of fleeting fame, but of lasting peace. 
<start>Aye, and we are but one 
<start>Who dream, and we are but one: 
<start>Our dreams may mean the world is one 
<start>With all the same, and more. 
<start>I know you think 
<start>That you are not dead, 
<start>And so your tale is told; 
<start>And the truth is out of sight, 
<start>And the heart is bruised and wan, 
<start>And you smile yet, ah, not to-day. 
<start>I would your thoughts have heard, 
<start>In silence, through the sky, 
<start>And that the soul I knew 
<start>Would be a thing 
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>In the way that you have died. 
<start>No more, my true love, with a tear, 
<start>Nor with a prayer, nor with a word, 
<start>Do you weep in that way. 
<start>Come, tell my son, that I am sick, 
<start>And you must go to bed. 
<start>Come, tell my son, that you love me, 
<start>And that I must sleep. 
<start>Tell my son, that I love you, 
<start>And that I'll not say no more, 
<start>But that I will break with you and tell 
<start>Your dead and buried. 
<start>That is better than death. 
<start>That is better than death, 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>That breaks the starry night. 
<start>O Mary! the night is so fair! 
<start>Her face from the window shines; 
<start>She smiles to see the stars go by, 
<start>And hear the morning's bells. 
<start>They call her by name, we are she! 
<start>Her hands are full of care; 
<start>They bind her to an ancient thorn 
<start>And keep her from the light. 
<start>Alas, ah, my Lord! that I could see 
<start>How these are not the stars nor day, 
<start>To know how my love is grown so fair, 
<start>How so I am in love not she. 
<start>She walks in beauty e'en while we are
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>By which we feel it, 
<start>But this our love for it, 
<start>As yet alive. 
<start>The morning sun comes out in the morning-hue; 
<start>It is not yet a day or a month, 
<start>But a night in the midst of my love's delight. 
<start>To you and to me, 
<start>It is another time; 
<start>This I tell thee, 
<start>I tell to thee. 
<start>I sing to thee, 
<start>I sing to thee: 
<start>A voice that is never, always singing unto me. 
<start>The voices are not loud in the air, 
<start>They are not heard, but they are so near they touch me
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>But a fable told 
<start>Of the happy times when friends must keep 
<start>A vigil round the friends they lost, 
<start>And so, my girl, I must keep  
<start>But here, my girl. 
<start>You're not dreaming, you're not singing  
<start>What dreams are made of this? 
<start>To think that you'd ever loved 
<start>The joys you had forgot! 
<start>I think, too, you're reading the books 
<start>Of the future still asleep; 
<start>And to-day I write for one 
<start>By one alone to-morrow, 
<start>In your lonely cabin there 
<start>For a while. 
<start>You may
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>'Tis you I seek, O Love, to love. 
<start>When shall I go to sleep? 
<start>O, soon your soul shall break. 
<start>But to my love, O Love, do not break, 
<start>Nor call me from your breast, 
<start>But speak no word of ill or pain 
<start>But, smiling, softly say, 
<start>Love is all for me and I; 
<start>But look not back on bliss or care 
<start>Where I and Love have died: 
<start>If to some other sphere I roam! say, 
<start>And hearken to my call, 
<start>She is but here to die and live, 
<start>To die for love. 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>Of fairy-wrought things! 
<start>Thou art not what the angels deem, 
<start>But something far away. 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream, 
<start>But something far away. 
<start>The clouds are flying; the night 
<start>Is falling fast; 
<start>The moon is not a-blazing 
<start>On the horizon gray. 
<start>Thou art not what the angels deem 
<start>A fair fair day! 
<start>Thou art not what the angels deem 
<start>A fair fair fair day! 
<start>Alone thyself, alone 
<start>Upon the ground, 
<start>Alone within a clod 
<start>With thy golden
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>That leaves the garden all alone, 
<start>And in her gentle voice sings: 
<start>I had for her the light that stays 
<start>The rain, the frost, and sunshine too. 
<start>I had a child, no son was born. 
<start>No one but he was born to-day. 
<start>He had no eyes for seeing, 
<start>No one to hear, his voice no reply; 
<start>And then he died. 
<start>He had no words for crying aloud; 
<start>He only smiled for her distress, 
<start>And then he died. 
<start>His very heart, his very brain, 
<start>Was bruised with all the sorrow 
<start>She bore him through the years 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>When thou art young! 
<start>Life is not a dream 
<start>When thou art old; 
<start>If my faith be true, 
<start>Why shouldst thou fear? 
<start>Why shouldest thou fear? 
<start>There the great will keep 
<start>His faithful face, 
<start>And his strong hand the sword 
<start>In a fight to save 
<start>The people on his side  
<start>If this is all a dream! 
<start>For who would think 
<start>The day should dim 
<start>His eyes so bright, 
<start>Who would not take his word 
<start>And the sword so bright? 
<start>There the good will keep 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>That has become a fact; 
<start>And even as the sun 
<start>Puts out his face, 
<start>Which in the evening sky 
<start>Glitters with fire 
<start>As if it had a fire, 
<start>The great stars there grow dim and bare; 
<start>And I have lost me in 
<start>The sweet little light of thought. 
<start>Love, the love between man and God, 
<start>Is a dream of man, 
<start>And God is a dream 
<start>In which God is a dream. 
<start>Love, believe, is not a mere passion 
<start>A fancy, 
<start>Nor that which has itself the power 
<start>To bring death;
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>To the touch of you, 
<start>And they are sweet and full of gladness, 
<start>They seem to give you birth. 
<start>Hush! for I hear you whispering, sweetly over the leaves, 
<start>Hush! to the far south, and there I sing: 
<start>That I can live forever when you come to-night, 
<start>For the sun of this world has begun his dawning hour 
<start>And he will bring us home again with a golden star. 
<start>The stars of heaven are but the golden rings, bright as the sun, 
<start>And the day-star is but a gleam of gold. 
<start>Let me lie down and rest while you kneel to me in your arms 
<start>And hear
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>And shadows that abide there 
<start>Away from those who love to-day. 
<start>She stands with eyes so light and mild, 
<start>Like a star within the sky; 
<start>And she has hands that are pure and bare, 
<start>As gentle and kind as she. 
<start>She does not heed the rain or snows, 
<start>She goes barefoot, but always runs, 
<start>And walks by the stream and shade 
<start>For her dear little children's sake. 
<start>Her face is calm in quiet hours, 
<start>And all her thoughts are clear and light. 
<start>She has no fear of death or harm, 
<start>No tenderness or sorrow there; 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>From her young garden home; 
<start>And to herself her heart is proud, 
<start>And her bright looks are glad. 
<start>O, she is fair as the moon; 
<start>Her hair is soft and fair; 
<start>And her eyes are tender and calm, 
<start>As to the dawn she is gone; 
<start>But she is sad as the rose 
<start>Whose eyes are bright and fair. 
<start>Her face a soft and fair blue sky,  
<start>And a happy heart to rest  
<start>But alas, alas, alas, my heart 
<start>Is cold and bare. 
<start>O pretty maid, I bid you haste, my dearest child dear, 
<start>In
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than honey from the vine. 
<start>'Tis sweet to sit by the fire alone, 
<start>And to feel the burning rays 
<start>Which the long night wears on my eyelids, 
<start>And the glow of the lamp. 
<start>'Tis sweet to sit by the fire alone, 
<start>And to hear that the night sings 
<start>Of love and song together 
<start>And of wine and of dreams. 
<start>'Tis sweet for me to sleep on the fire alone 
<start>And the soft sun shines on the ground; 
<start>So the night's music breathes of love without ceasing 
<start>Or ceasing; and the music of dreams 
<start>Is music that is the
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than with the sweet wine of the wine of Italy: 
<start>The heart will want no wine, so let us set, 
<start>After some day or other, wine to wine. 
<start>But first and foremost is the wine that bears 
<start>Our praises on our lips before we speak, 
<start>And of itself, that we possess, we bring 
<start>A word of promise still; and if a word 
<start>We have, not very dear, the praise of God, 
<start>Say, Thou hast given us to the wine of Italy. 
<start>Then as I poured the holy cup into my mouth 
<start>I looked round; no thing there was so glad or sweet 
<start>E'en as the face of the King,
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>That flutters, dies; 
<start>To thee a thousand years 
<start>Make known to me 
<start>What I could dare. 
<start>If e'er a dream hath found, 
<start>Truth's deep, deep core 
<start>I hold not, knowing, yet 
<start>There is not a hope: 
<start>As life in death is sweet, 
<start>Death's sweetest sleep, 
<start>'Twill sweet me if my heart be blind, 
<start>To thee an end. 
<start>From the grave!  
<start>Where lies the woe? 
<start>He that hath done with his hand, 
<start>And suffered with his feet, 
<start>Lies in
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>And seems to think a little child. 
<start>Oh, I'm grieved for her I think I've been 
<start>All alone in my own despair 
<start>With all my hopes for her, but she's gone, 
<start>And my heart burns so! 
<start>Oh! I'm lost so many a time, when 'twas just then that I turned for 
<start>There's no one now that I love the more, 
<start>While I'm away in my own despair. 
<start>But once I had a love that I dearly knew  
<start>It's far from heaven that is to be. 
<start>Oh, I'm lonely and lonely and alone, 
<start>And I'm lost so many a time
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than any salt of the sea; 
<start>And no one wants you to-day when 
<start>You are in full prime. 
<start>We have a house of roses in a greenwood, 
<start>We have a garden that we love to climb, 
<start>And a pretty little house, so small 
<start>And grand, it does not care for the weather. 
<start>We have roses that are pink in the sun, 
<start>To hang on the window-pane, 
<start>And all the roses fall on their petals 
<start>That gleam and wave through the air. 
<start>With one and the other in our garden we have two 
<start>Lullabies that love to lie in bed, 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>She walked once more in fairyland, 
<start>But this time 'twas only a dream! 
<start>Her heart the maiden of a friend 
<start>Could ne'er soothe, since he, no more, 
<start>He is on wing for evermore, 
<start>And sings to her and he dreams to her! 
<start>I think now the day is almost done, 
<start>Oh, welcome to the house of woe!  
<start>It is full oft we know it is done: 
<start>For that old night was hard on him alone, 
<start>When he would wake by the sweet light of the moon 
<start>And find the door flung open wide. 
<start>I have come, oh welcome, she cried,
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>And say I can never live. 
<start>My heart is like an April night 
<start>I cannot see or hear; 
<start>So sad a fate I cannot bear 
<start>For those who cannot die. 
<start>And so, my soul is breaking fast 
<start>With love that is never true. 
<start>It is but the hour of joy, 
<start>That will not fade away; 
<start>The sun has climbed the hill above, 
<start>And so my love is high. 
<start>This song, my only joy, I pray, 
<start>Is done to-night for ever. 
<start>It comes from the dear heart of a child 
<start>Who was stricken with despair. 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>That comes not by the hand; 
<start>What is the life that can pass 
<start>On life and death apart? 
<start>I dare not ask so much 
<start>From him who makes men good. 
<start>Who gives the good that makes? 
<start>And who makes the false, or true? 
<start>Love is to us less bright, 
<start>Nor pleasure with its beams; 
<start>The heart is only bliss: the eye 
<start>Is not a friend or guide. 
<start>Love is the source of pleasure 
<start>And makes a heart of pain; 
<start>It only breaks when there is pain, 
<start>It only breaks when 
<start>The world is full of death. 
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>sown by a shepherd of the hills. 
<start>The wild bees throng, 
<start>The nightingales sing 
<start>Their sweetest lay; 
<start>The flowers sing, 
<start>And a merry sea they hold 
<start>And they float, and they rave, until we drift to the sea, 
<start>Singing so, so, so softly, with so sweet a song. 
<start>The earth smiles sweet to hear, 
<start>That heaven hath never given, 
<start>But this is an apple and is growing to be crowned again. 
<start>A sweet sweet garden! but thou art not fair upon earth before; 
<start>For a flower is sweeter for the heart than e'er, but a sweeter tree; 
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than the sweet smelling herb, and when he tastes, 
<start>You forget he loves you and will not stir. 
<start>The rose in its fair bosom, and the lily's red 
<start>The honey is not so sweet as it should seem! 
<start>Thus all my life have I seen this, and seen 
<start>How the wild flowers can be all made up 
<start>Of the seed that was never planted yet. 
<start>In the flower-house of old I have laid a stone, 
<start>And it has been built up by a lady fair, 
<start>And her name I have not forgot at present 
<start>Without a blush which would not be forgotten now. 
<start>She is in this garden sitting alone, beside
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than what's in your cup of ale. 
<start>If you would not mind all this, 
<start>And wish them better if you went 
<start>I think you may find them worth a while. 
<start>The rosebush is quite the common thing; 
<start>'Tis sweet to look at and smell, 
<start>By being so fond of roses, 
<start>Your hair will grow thinner; 
<start>For roses, like roses in summer, 
<start>Are dearer to me. 
<start>I often saw you walking in the lane 
<start>As fast as you could see; 
<start>You were not too kind, so sweet, so fair, so fine 
<start>If you would leave your country's roses
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>While I mourn,  
<start>How many a year ago? 
<start>How many a year ago? 
<start>In the evening we met again; 
<start>We had a long pleasant walk; 
<start>Then we parted and looked out, 
<start>And you had me so: 
<start>I would have given you my hand, 
<start>It was too hard to hold: 
<start>You promised, sweet, you would not wait 
<start>For your return here. 
<start>Why do you always seem to say 
<start>That I am going to be sad? 
<start>He who would think of this is gone, 
<start>And has gone to bed, 
<start>Will never think of it; the
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>and in its depths as the waters run, 
<start>with a thick root that fills the whole of it  
<start>and the whole will be a tender leaf  
<start>the root may drop a little leaf, 
<start>but the sweetest in the world. 
<start>The garden is the garden of my heart; 
<start>my only garden is the garden of the Lord. 
<start>The garden of love is a place to keep 
<start>where all the children's voices can be heard, 
<start>where the voices of people are still and 
<start>unknowing. 
<start>In the garden of love the world is a garden, 
<start>where the hearts of men are all in one 
<start>and one. 
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>in his gardens and a pleasant dwelling of a good child. 
<start>If you would be here to my mother and you should be at home  
<start>my dear mother is so happy and kind as I used to be; 
<start>but now I shall cease to be glad, for I have always been very 
<start>pityful. 
<start>When the old man and her mother had parted 
<start>shortly, and they took one another by the heels, 
<start>and they ate the fat of a goose and threw it in the fire. 
<start>They brought it back, and made it into a stew, and they baked it 
<start>so the children ate it from the bottom up on to a long fork. 
<start>But it didn't help them if Mama put some
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>Or like the sunlight from the sun. 
<start>The heart that waits for thee may see 
<start>The wonder of thy looks and words. 
<start>And many a heart that waits for thee might find 
<start>No comfort. 
<start>She loves the little things of earth, 
<start>The golden trees, the sunny waves, 
<start>The lilies, sweet with sweetness; 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night 
<start>Or like the sunlight from the sun. 
<start>Sweet as a garden flower, 
<start>The woods to bearest her will be: 
<start>She walks with sweetest feet 
<start>Under their branches, where she waits 
<start>For the light that shines from heaven afar. 
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>Until I take the sword 
<start>And the heart within my breast, 
<start>The great sword that did not yield, 
<start>I that gave it for your sake. 
<start>No, never more the king would take 
<start>Your heart and count your treasure, 
<start>But I say, I would lay it down 
<start>And he must follow me. 
<start>His heart was so full of pain 
<start>He found the sword behind me, 
<start>I gave it to his soul: the thing 
<start>Had gone to ruin. I might hold 
<start>A moment's rest in his hold, 
<start>And he was no longer one. 
<start>The king must have said it must be so, 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>But the true, sweet dreams I hear: 
<start>We are the same and I am one. 
<start>I am the son of a great sea, 
<start>A giant in the sea: 
<start>I am the ocean of the soul, 
<start>That rises o'er the vast. 
<start>My eyes are bright like a gem 
<start>Which a thousand suns have crowned, 
<start>As mine eyes lift to those depths 
<start>Where I am nigh to death. 
<start>I am no king but where I came 
<start>Is my true-love all alone. 
<start>My lips lie white as snow, 
<start>Nor my heart is cold as foam, 
<start>But I am good and
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>Straying from its branches; 
<start>When the winter's close they come to a last of Spring, 
<start>And you look at the long brown boughs, and the white trees still below. 
<start>And you wonder, does the summer year have no other home 
<start>Than ours, no home but our own? 
<start>We'll always go back to the old ways of old men, 
<start>And hear the old songs we sang, 
<start>That used to sing to us three and three. 
<start>You'll never again go back 
<start>Where those old songs we used to sing 
<start>Are deadlier still than theirs. 
<start>We'll bring them home once more, 
<start>And find the flowers we loved so
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>In pity for myself and mine, 
<start>And leave me, all alone with fate, 
<start>To dream the last little dream I made. 
<start>Forgive me: I have loved you since last I knew, 
<start>And I will love you to the end of the earth; 
<start>I will love you to my heart, oh, let the tears 
<start>Of love drop like rain and rain will spring again. 
<start>No light, no light, no light, in all around 
<start>Where the trees stand still in their boughs of gold. 
<start>No breath and no sound, no sound, in all around, 
<start>Save a dull throb and a broken sigh, 
<start>Save a strange murmur of despair in the
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than with mine own. 
<start>You, I do, can taste it, all. 
<start>The same, sir, you call the grape of all: 
<start>When the first fruit is ripe, the next is done. 
<start>A hundred years 
<start>Have come over you. 
<start>You are like a flower that is made of the years: 
<start>When the second fruit is ripe, and the second one 
<start>Is done, 
<start>You are in love. 
<start>You have a soul to match 
<start>The soul with the heart in love. 
<start>You know what I say. 
<start>And, as ye talk, there comes a sound, 
<start>Of coming
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>Ascending unto death, 
<start>But this I will say unto ye that he is dead! 
<start>I can tell you by and by, 
<start>He is dead when day is done, 
<start>And never yet another breeze blows 
<start>In the year's soft mist. 
<start>My dear old wife, 
<start>As you have often told me, never will he die. 
<start>But I shall tell you he is dead, and you and I shall 
<start>never a word say. 
<start>My little little lad, 
<start>You will say as you list, she will stand up when he is dead, 
<start>And say unto me, O sweetly, little lady, that he is dead! 
<start>Your
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>than lemonade, and is worth the long delay. 
<start>Forget the paltry pleasures of the day you sought 
<start>By your good brother to his palace; 
<start>And if your joys are those of pleasure past, 
<start>Remember that a long delay was worth 
<start>The pleasures of the day you sought by your brother. 
<start>Weeping, the stranger murmured; 
<start>Our Father, pitying so, 
<start>Has heard the paltry pleasures of the day you sought. 
<start>Weep, for the heart of the heart is weary indeed, 
<start>Forgetting, alas! how vain in the search for peace. 
<start>Weep for the heart of the heart, but our hearts have the
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>Of some divine eternity, 
<start>And this will make us glad and strong, 
<start>And all our woes our joys to know. 
<start>For this, I thank your lord, the lord, 
<start>Great lord of all things glorious and benign, 
<start>Who gives his heart to love, to give 
<start>His spirit to the task of man, 
<start>And not to man in any way. 
<start>You say that no love cannot be won 
<start>By such a love of love as you have wrought 
<start>In my own heart and in mine own mind, I swear, 
<start>But love is what you are and what you should be, 
<start>And that you love me! 
<start>O good
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>When birds ope their wings, 
<start>And leaves her soft attire, 
<start>And goes from village to the mill; 
<start>But if you wish to know 
<start>If she is always fair, 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night 
<start>When birds ope their wings; 
<start>When she goes from village to the mill, 
<start>And leaves her soft attire, 
<start>And goes from mill to the mill. 
<start>A beautiful child may run away from home, 
<start>But the time for such a run is nigh  
<start>She can tell the time of a golden egg, 
<start>And a bright cup thereof. 
<start>And it is very pleasant to go to
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>In twilight of the dreamed hill! 
<start>She has a silver hair to go 
<start>In a golden, rich array, 
<start>While I sit with her, on my wing, 
<start>In the silent sky below. 
<start>The sweet, innocent look o'er her brows 
<start>A glance of calm emotion brings, 
<start>Her eyes, like stars, arise and shine 
<start>On me from out the light of day. 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night 
<start>In twilight of the dreamed hill! 
<start>The dear, innocent look o'er her brows 
<start>A smile of love at night is glinting, 
<start>The smile of love shines forth in her
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>with a tall leaf and a tall tree is a tall tree. 
<start>Come, O, let our hearts be together, let our eyes be together the 
<start>night be always a bright cup of 
<start>wine is the wine of the vine 
<start>for the wine of all life is a tall tender tree 
<start>with a tall tree and a tall tree is a tall tree. 
<start>Come, O, let our feet be steadfast 
<start>in the shadow and the glory of dawn 
<start>and the shadow of sleep 
<start>and the shadow of death 
<start>and the death of day, 
<start>And with the dust and with the dust of morning 
<start>come the dawn, come the dawn to-night. 
<start>The
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>Where the rain comes and the sunset goes, 
<start>And the flowers are sweet with the scent of spring, 
<start>And the leaves are tender and pure with youth, 
<start>There is no sound to me of the wind, 
<start>For the rain is all about the trees. 
<start>And the sun is shining and my feet are bent, 
<start>And the air is bare among the leaves, 
<start>And the shadows and the shadows and the shadows, 
<start>And the raindrops lie in the flowers. 
<start>And the wind, like one who hears a sound in sleep 
<start>That is sad and low and sad as death at last, 
<start>Has blown his horn about the window pane, 
<start>And away is come the sound
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than ever the cup was tasted by us. 
<start>Our tastes and feelings have changed and our views and our ways. 
<start>Our feelings will change and we may have ways and we will have wit. 
<start>Yet a man should know what others are, and how to give their 
<start>Pleasure's own satisfaction, and how to love the least. 
<start>They always have their merits, even the great ones, 
<start>And they have their times. They have gone away; but they are not gone. 
<start>And the hours pass in the sunshine and the noon in the dew. 
<start>And you, good sir, are content to take it in with me, sir, 
<start>Though the hours pass and you smile at me. 
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>On the brink of the water's brink, 
<start>And a beautiful and tranquil pool, 
<start>With never a wave upon it, 
<start>No ripple in it that you can see, 
<start>The bright and sparkling green 
<start>Of the long-legged river, 
<start>A little garden with a sea; 
<start>And there you shall find it a 
<start>beautiful and tranquil pool, 
<start>By the river's foot that flowed there, 
<start>And for you shall come the sea, 
<start>A gentle and sweet water flowing softly, 
<start>On the side of the stream, 
<start>And one foot planted on it there, 
<start>'Mid the flowers in it, 
<start>And
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>on which I sit alone, a tall tender tree a tall tree for ever. 
<start>I am but the first, the last, the last wild flower to blow in the 
<start>wind of the day. 
<start>A tree of the red, the rose of the rose-leafed isle, the 
<start>bead of the sea is the breeze's balmy scent, the 
<start>golden stars of the skies shine down upon it like the eyes 
<start>of dreams. 
<start>And   the world is a tree of the pure light of the sweet, the 
<start>sweet song of the night and eve, 
<start>the dream of love, the dream that is born from the breath of the world's sweetness, 
<start>the singing of the starry
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than dandelion-flower; nor the sweet perfume 
<start>That greets, as if of a pure desert, spring. 
<start>It is the fragrance of the morning clear, 
<start>That tells my soul, through your unearthly ways, 
<start>The secrets of a fairy forest. 
<start>And I must leave your sweetest things of spring, 
<start>Where the cool buds, that fade on thy golden lutes, 
<start>Are sweeter, and where the violet's sweetness dies, 
<start>More tender than the music of the sea. 
<start>The sea is fair to thy lips the sea with roses, 
<start>The dew is warm with myrrh, the waters deep 
<start>Are sweeter than the songs
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>Hath risen in the heavens. 
<start>And, as of old, I read of her 
<start>With eyes and lips that loved her, 
<start>Though she is young and fair and good 
<start>And very far away; 
<start>And when she looks, her heart is gay, 
<start>It is like a dove in tears. 
<start>I think she thinks she's coming  
<start>The bright morning with the sky 
<start>Is her delight to me and you  
<start>I hope it is not so soon! 
<start>For though it is late, I have no doubt 
<start>That it shall come to pass, 
<start>If you will tell me right, she will not leave 
<start>The
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than your dear lover and his dream, 
<start>For there it lies   a bitter, cold taste, 
<start>Though the heart and hand must keep it still. 
<start>For now the summer sun is here and all 
<start>Will sing to the bird on his nest, 
<start>But he will not come as a sign of fear 'till 
<start>the rose is up and the moon has gone. 
<start>This is the last of summer and the first of spring, 
<start>The first of spring and the first of spring weather, 
<start>And the sun with a sunless eye is on us 
<start>As the leaves are on the ground that is so warm. 
<start>And the little birds, my merry little birds,
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>On her soft pillow  
<start>She looks, but with a smile 
<start>She knows not when to tell. 
<start>The winds in all directions run, 
<start>No sound comes, only the leaves  
<start>She knows not if they harm or fright, 
<start>No light of footfall frighten. 
<start>The wind in all directions sings, 
<start>No sound comes, only the leaves  
<start>She knows not if they harm or fright, 
<start>No light of footfall frighten. 
<start>And though the world be cold and grey 
<start>And bleak and bare, 
<start>She knows not where to find her feet  
<start>When morning dawns; but when night shall come
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>where the lilies and the white blossoms run. 
<start>Then, like the dawn-fall, I turn 
<start>round to the sea-shore, and there let go my eyes, 
<start>and from me the light of the sun 
<start>harkens through the garden-ways. 
<start>I see the sun ascending, 
<start>And the white-rooted sun, 
<start>I feel his touch on me as it falls, 
<start>and I see his face 
<start>and feel his tears upon my tears, 
<start>and see the white of the clouds at night, 
<start>and the pale face of the earth before the dawn, 
<start>and the dim eye of the sun. 
<start>And I know that
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>But a thing of dreams; 
<start>It is not the mere, sweet sweet smell of earth, 
<start>But the sweet touch of the air; 
<start>Then the joys that are the fruits of the breath of delight, 
<start>In a vision, are the things of beauty, 
<start>And the joys that are the fruits of the joys 
<start>Of the dear, sweet, familiar things; 
<start>And they are joys for thee who see them in them; 
<start>For they are not dreams that must fade away, 
<start>And they are not dreams that cannot die away, 
<start>And forever be! 
<start>We live a life of days, then we must live longs, 
<start>Like many things
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>That holds the world as one; 
<start>Life, believe, is a truth and life 
<start>Are dreams that pass away. 
<start>He who dreams to death, 
<start>He who dreams to death 
<start>And lives and lives, 
<start>He who lives to die  
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream 
<start>That holds the world as one. 
<start>If any star 
<start>That in its flight 
<start>Has left its light at last 
<start>May yet forget its birth, 
<start>If only heaven, that star 
<start>Is free, 
<start>He who comes to death 
<start>Must know 
<start>He shall die that which he
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>with a leaf on its top. And now he went off and hid 
<start>himself from his pursuers and hid him, while the 
<start>others followed him. 
<start>Then the old man lifted his face, and said: 
<start>'O son of Atreus, the gods have punished thee in thy 
<start>sons' disgrace. It is no shame to leave thy father a tree which 
<start>was once an honoured bony bough.' 
<start>This he made ready with his hand, and at the last, the day had arrived 
<start>when he said: 'Telemachus, I had hoped you would return to the ships after 
<start>the first round of the contest in thy house, for I feared that Achilles 
<start>might carry you away
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>That brings but shadows to the light. 
<start>'Twould have been hard, I trust, 
<start>If that, dear Lady of olden days, 
<start>If thou didst bid the living meet 
<start>In their own heart; and then a word, 
<start>And the soft sigh of soft delight. 
<start>O, then the heart at least we see, 
<start>It shall find the light when the rest 
<start>Return at our own feet at their call; 
<start>And then it shall not have to wait 
<start>The hour that thou wilt hear, and then 
<start>And know the sweet end awaits. 
<start>A time to come, my friend, 
<start>As many years ago we walked
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>When I must die 
<start>And the stars are stilled 
<start>When my soul is free 
<start>And sweet on earth; 
<start>For when I shall see the sky's blue 
<start>And the white foam, 
<start>Let my soul's light fall 
<start>Like the waves before them fleet; 
<start>And the night-wind's sighs 
<start>And the sweet flowers by my side, 
<start>Make me as sweet 
<start>As the summer night 
<start>When I lie, 
<start>In the garden light  
<start>And the earth's gladness. 
<start>The sweet air, free as the breeze 
<start>And wild as the trees! 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>Of happy days when stars have flown? 
<start>It is not the evening of this night, 
<start>When all of her white hands are bare, 
<start>And all of her arms are heavy, bare, 
<start>And all of her dark hair dishevelled; 
<start>It is not the sunset of this day, 
<start>When no one comes for her to take, 
<start>And no one comes to call her dead, 
<start>And she's a sleeping woman who is dead. 
<start>So there it is, with love for love to-night, 
<start>With her lips clasp'd in kisses sweet, 
<start>With her eyes white as the summer night, 
<start>There we sit, and look around, and smile
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>That a man could hold 
<start>Upon its stems, in the year 
<start>When my soul grew blind. 
<start>And it seems to me it comes not 
<start>Through the year's eclipse  
<start>But it seems the years of years have 
<start>Changed my leafage: 
<start>I, who was so young an' sweet, 
<start>Went to be 
<start>The child of a bird  
<start>The pride of a nation 
<start>Made of me. 
<start>I went to a wedding in the woods, 
<start>A-munchinin' o're flowers, 
<start>An' a-hunning for a man to find 
<start>His lady's face, 
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than the bitter taste of honey wine. 
<start>The wind of time is so swift and mild, 
<start>It will not harm your senses too much; 
<start>And thus, if the time has come to sigh 
<start>Your heart is very merry with a breeze, 
<start>O, then it will not be for me too late 
<start>Or foolish thoughts, the time is long and long. 
<start>The flowers and flowers' fragrance fly so far 
<start>As 'tis through cloud and weather from hill and steep, 
<start>How far from us, how far away will be 
<start>All that to the heart may be forgiven! 
<start>But, 'tis the hour when first we sing the best! 
<start>I
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>That rises by the side of the sea, 
<start>And that, as if grown for you, the trees 
<start>stand free of any hand. 
<start>So the young boy, he was toiling there 
<start>for dear to every one. 
<start>And he made music when in the land 
<start>and the sea, 
<start>For his song was never heard by men, 
<start>He only heard the birds and birds 
<start>and birds! 
<start>You would think this fair young creature had no need 
<start>for wings, 
<start>And no need for wings, 
<start>For he had never wings and never wings. 
<start>His feet were so small, his arms so round, 
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>Where the sun's bright rays may be seen 
<start>Beneath the sunbeams of a bride 
<start>That is all love unto a day! 
<start>I've heard of the maiden who sat by her son, 
<start>And she was gentle and kind and kind, 
<start>She looked like a mother as her son 
<start>Should look on her as he looked on her,  
<start>And a thousand angels were singing, 
<start>And the children sang and sang, and the child 
<start>Strove very joyously to kiss her hand; 
<start>And she whispered to her good old mother, O
<start>My child, I hear your mother say, 
<start>I heard you hear the father talking at play,  
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>Her locks, unclasping, soft. 
<start>Her hair, that seems, like summer's, warm 
<start>Upon her shoulders light, 
<start>With wreaths, like morning's leaves, are curled, 
<start>And, like her fingers down her hair 
<start>Makes one fine zone; 
<start>Her eye is fair, and all her face 
<start>Is a sweet kiss: 
<start>She keeps the garden all at home 
<start>With naught to do, save to play, to weep, 
<start>And sing. 
<start>And here and there the violet, on the hill 
<start>Of purple lawn, 
<start>Hid by a fairy bee, I lay 
<start>A dream
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>So old it will not grow: 
<start>There is a pleasant spot in which to 
<start>live long in a time of sorrow. 
<start>Let us take our lives and part 
<start>As brothers, brothers true and brave; 
<start>For, brother, brothers, our lives are 
<start>broken asunder. 
<start>I am all a mother's children, 
<start>All my brothers' brothers, brothers, 
<start>The whole earth has its sons as brothers 
<start>And brothers' brothers' mothers, 
<start>My brothers, brothers, men and I 
<start>have children now with one another. 
<start>How long will this be, brother, 
<start>How long will the sea hold me, 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>As the young morning breaks on the lawn, 
<start>Who with the light of morning fills the room 
<start>With those whose eyes have lost their light as they 
<start>See her through the morning with a kiss for her! 
<start>I love her with fond ardor, as a bride, 
<start>Who the new moon shines o'er some distant strand; 
<start>I feel its warmth, as she makes me feel her hand 
<start>Lift up to bless my heart as of old she used; 
<start>I cannot bear the sight of her as though no more, 
<start>But only hear the soft voice of the wind 
<start>Calling to my window over the meads of green, 
<start>The birds of spring, at the foot of the
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>In days when roses look on many a face, 
<start>In days when hearts beat and lips speak in all places 
<start>As though you were the only heart you ever saw. 
<start>The scent has grown soft beneath the livery, 
<start>A woman's voice tells how soft it once was; 
<start>But yet it sings no further as my story 
<start>A few days ago to-night shall echo there. 
<start>The moonlight gleams and the morning leaves fade; 
<start>The river-mist and water-lily blow  
<start>The sea is calm, but you will not go away. 
<start>Only her light and the nightlight are mine. 
<start>You can never go away, O bird. 
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>As I sit here; you would know 
<start>The way my children have died 
<start>I never knew before. 
<start>I cannot give up my child, 
<start>I cannot give in vain; 
<start>But go to the fields of wheat 
<start>Where the corn is the only food, 
<start>And bring my child to me. 
<start>My children have gone to sea 
<start>To seek for bread 
<start>On the barren earth below, 
<start>The only food for all. 
<start>To the fields of barley 
<start>Do not fall away 
<start>From the barren earth above, 
<start>My beautiful children; 
<start>I cannot give the rain 
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>As I in silence weep; 
<start>Do not go back to the days of old 
<start>When we did beek and mild; 
<start>Nor weep, as do the children who 
<start>Filled the dear earth with cheer; 
<start>Nor sorrow, as the little, dear 
<start>Mother whose tender eyes 
<start>Shall meet thee in the coming year, 
<start>Nor cry, as thou in pain didst plead 
<start>For all the world to know. 
<start>What does a man's life like a woman's? A woman's man? Yes? No? 
<start>Why then, the father and mother and child 
<start>Are brothers when they are not. 
<start>What does she love in marriage?
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>For my grave and weep for my dead. 
<start>Behold, here is a man 
<start>Sang from a castle, 
<start>And a king and a duke of state, 
<start>That ruled with great respect: 
<start>For a king and a duke of state 
<start>Were born in the sea of the West. 
<start>Their parents in their castles bore him, 
<start>And his father, upon a tree, 
<start>To their mother, the sweetly-smiling maid. 
<start>Thus was he born, 
<start>And all who look on her face are sad and sad. 
<start>The kings in his castle in the land 
<start>Now live their lives upon the trees and stones, 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>The old tradition tells,  
<start>We're all in a trice  
<start>Why should a thing, you ask, 
<start>Pass without a name? 
<start>Or is it that we know 
<start>One hour more of life? 
<start>O wherefore must our souls 
<start>Fly from heaven to earth? 
<start>No, that our tears alone 
<start>Must we for aye 
<start>Pass to the heart to-night! 
<start>The yearlong march has come, 
<start>And to the dead we are 
<start>Pass it off to the day; 
<start>The morning of the year 
<start>To her with grief has come, 
<start>The day of
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>When Love goes by. 
<start>She wears a silken vest, a blue 
<start>Throned with dew:  with purple flowers 
<start>Her eyes are set, and deep with sleep 
<start>Her voice is heard below. 
<start>Yet, in her eyes, she smiles, and there 
<start>Rises up a tender grace. 
<start>Now, as a saint at eve, I kneel 
<start>And pray to her in prayer, 
<start>But in her eyes, I hear her words, I hear, 
<start>As they are sung. 
<start>Now, as a bird upon the mountain's brink, 
<start>I sit in a cave-like bay, 
<start>While far away the waters rave
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>Of visions by that sunset; 
<start>The world is round, and life is good; 
<start>It makes me wish it was so. 
<start>Behold, there's nothing here below 
<start>But beauty as a flower. 
<start>The trees are all, and all are fair 
<start>But flowers are no where near; 
<start>All their leaves are green and bare, 
<start>They have given me the world. 
<start>The morning's still as the day before; 
<start>And the sky clear is and clear; 
<start>It shines like a golden star 
<start>To the little stars in the sky. 
<start>They stand on the hills beside the lake 
<start>And whisper softly as they go
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>Ere life itself was born. 
<start>He that shall do what he will, 
<start>Not be undone by any ill, 
<start>Is worth more to all than to me. 
<start>The man's the man with whom you meet, 
<start>The man for whom you live. 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream 
<start>So long before we make it, 
<start>As long before we die and wait 
<start>To die ourselves to live. 
<start>He who shall do what he will not do, 
<start>He best who can, 
<start>That is his only friend; 
<start>He that shall give your love your all, 
<start>And so be true to you. 
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>Till I have died. 
<start>I have not forgotten you, you are dead; 
<start>I have only you; 
<start>Only the dead are mine, that I may weep 
<start>Till the dead give me the kiss of my life. 
<start>In the year when I was dying like thee 
<start>All the children of the world knew I not 
<start>Of a friend or of a kindred, and a name, 
<start>Took the place of a sorrowful thing I loved, 
<start>And made a joyous end. 
<start>I have never known the light of the starlight of the moonlight, 
<start>The touch of the tender glow of the tears, 
<start>The sound of thine, the voice
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>It is the emblem that we plant, and the symbol 
<start>that we know. 
<start>And it tells how in the midst of strife and of 
<start>woes I know I live, and what this love will bring 
<start>and what the beauty will bring. 
<start>It is the same with the other branches of the 
<start>mellow meadows; it is the same with the dew upon 
<start>the fallen leaves, that flows gently on till it touches 
<start>the ground below, nor has it ceased to flow. 
<start>All these are its roots. 
<start>It is the path that we walk on to happiness, the way 
<start>to its glory, where the heart of the earth and the 
<start>thick world dwell
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>That makes a sky blue for her feet; 
<start>There is a sound that tells her why 
<start>She may not fly from this her home. 
<start>I'm walking on a field; the sun 
<start>Flashes on it full again; 
<start>I have reached the garden-lands,  
<start>The meadows and the forest trees. 
<start>I pass on with the light, bright spring, 
<start>The air so mellow and warm; 
<start>In the glistening garden-lands 
<start>I hear the rushing of the wind. 
<start>When I come, my heart will cease to beat 
<start>As I walk in the wood; 
<start>I can see the flower that blooms there 
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>That grows along the land; 
<start>In the sun it spreads its verdant verdance, 
<start>And the sea it warms its bosom, 
<start>And the earth is glad and blest with sunlight, 
<start>And earth is glad and blest with rain, 
<start>Even though the clouds are falling, 
<start>And the storm is over all, 
<start>And the long night of Summer long since, 
<start>While thou goest with me, 
<start>Thou goest with me, and I am one with thee, 
<start>To the distant places, all that smile and glow; 
<start>I am thy mother and thy mother's wife, 
<start>Thy wife to me, thy wife to me! 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>That dreams alone. 
<start>Love's face 
<start>Is so still and free 
<start>Though yet the skies have changed; 
<start>And love can see it not. 
<start>Love's heart 
<start>Is sweet in so much pain, 
<start>And tender as the love 
<start>That gives. 
<start>Love's face 
<start>Is soft and tender and good 
<start>As the lips love to sing 
<start>Around her and around, 
<start>As the lips that love to kiss. 
<start>And Love can feel her body's heart 
<start>As a tender flower 
<start>That would grow and die, and die 
<start>Like a flower of the dead. 
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than with me. 
<start>We can't be 
<start>A part of the world without you. 
<start>It is time to be apart, 
<start>And now is our appointed time 
<start>To wander on before you, 
<start>As you are the great conductor of our race. 
<start>Come forth!  And bring our joys again, 
<start>And let our prayers be filled; 
<start>The old school times are all too long; 
<start>Our young hearts are like old clay; 
<start>But with you are our hearts again, and, dear Lord, 
<start>We shall live to our youth again. 
<start>To him who has forgotten us 
<start>All that we know.
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than with the world is more the life of youth. 
<start>And then with me the world, and a whole world of you, 
<start>That is the world. 
<start>You have so often, when we live, to say. 
<start>A happy end has come for ever, to be, 
<start>And this is peace and rest between ourselves, 
<start>A world of peace beyond the world of us, 
<start>Where each hath what he will if there's none can take it. 
<start>Our happiness we know, a truth it is, 
<start>A truth that brings us home to the hearts of men; 
<start>A truth we take for our own good, though it may be  
<start>Some little word from a
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>Though its shadows fall across. 
<start>Go not forward now.  The world is near. 
<start>Go on!  Be not discouraged; 
<start>To you I send this warning.  When I say 
<start>I will not wake, my prayer is not in vain, 
<start>Aye, still the world shall wake from sleep, 
<start>And every shadow on me shall know 
<start>The hour of rest that shall be near. 
<start>Go not forward now!  But to-morrow 
<start>As the night grows dark and darker, 
<start>Go with you.  I will look upon you as one who would not sleep if, 
<start>Onward, I know, one hand should grasp the sword and go. 
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>At the parting of my years; 
<start>The time we shall last is now; 
<start>Then come, and keep these bones below, 
<start>Or they shall die! 
<start>The sun sank down 
<start>His slumbering cloud; 
<start>In the silent dawn, 
<start>His face, that wore not a veil, 
<start>Was at rest. 
<start>He had left the grave behind; 
<start>He had fled to the sea; 
<start>In the darkness and the night 
<start>In silence he lay. 
<start>O God! he said, 
<start>What have I done 
<start>Since we parted apart? 
<start>Why have I left thee thus, 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>That we must tread and cross 
<start>In the dark, to find our feet. 
<start>Life is a vision, but it is the only, 
<start>Homeward-bound vision. 
<start>Only the faint song of the rain, the rustling 
<start>Of wings in the wet, the sobbing leaves 
<start>On the dark paths with their shadows 
<start>Under the sky! 
<start>Only the whisper of the wind on the garden, and 
<start>Flat on the branches that lie between the branches that beat 
<start>As the leaves go rustling in the spring of flowers; 
<start>Only the slow, thin white sobbing of birds on the vernal moorings, 
<start>And the faint hum of the
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>That hides her sorrowing child, 
<start>So calm in the dark, and deep 
<start>To touch the trembling hands that press it. 
<start>She never had a single word. 
<start>And to her heart's delight, 
<start>She came, and walked in silence there. 
<start>And the world was all her bliss, 
<start>And her heart's glad delight, 
<start>And her feet pressed to the floor. 
<start>She did not ask, no, she said, 
<start>For words to speak, I hear she said; 
<start>But when I heard her call the King, 
<start>And whispered thus, with gentle tone  
<start>She was gone to me and went! 
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>down there. We do not believe that aught 
<start>hath changed in this house. The night is dim by all 
<start>our eyes from the outer door, 
<start>with dim walls of light and walls 
<start>and tall lamps shining out through the dim 
<start>darkness. It is not like 
<start>we in your house a dream can see. 
<start>No. Nay, God is very great, 
<start>that there is such a thing in the world: 
<start>He is glad that we are not men. Who can say 
<start>when our voices are heard to-day as we shall speak 
<start>no sound on high? or who has lost it to-night? The song 
<start>of the birds? 
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>Of golden blossoms and tender buds 
<start>Of tenderness. 
<start>If life be sweet and sweet for me 
<start>And earth be still beneath the tree, 
<start>Oh who would wish life were more divine 
<start>For me than I? 
<start>Come, let our hearts of tenderness 
<start>Be in a little, minute home 
<start>To one another as we pass 
<start>Through one another's ways. 
<start>We'll pass into the garden wild, 
<start>Where, when we're near the sun, the flowers 
<start>Are green and blooms are budding everywhere, 
<start>And I am glad. 
<start>And when the sun is brightening through 
<start>And the earth is
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>And a sweet flower is the garden of the flowers of the tree. 
<start>There it will sit and sleep and look behind thy sunny 
<start>bright brows and sigh, 
<start>And will think of love, dear, of love, and never be afraid. 
<start>And its soft hair is as light as a falling leaf,  
<start>It bends its soft head under thy white hands 
<start>and it whispers to them, My Dear, what is there to tell? 
<start>For never a shadow falls from the heaven above thee,  
<start>Ever a shadow falls from the cloud above  
<start>When the sun of morning is set, 
<start>And the flowers in the garden are growing to flower, 
<start>In the sunshine in the night time.
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>And mourn thy dying breath; 
<start>Come, all ye mourners, to the grave, 
<start>All ye who mourn, and come again, 
<start>Come, let us pray together. 
<start>To the ground, that none may pass, 
<start>To the grave, that none may hear, 
<start>We will go, and not to weep alone! 
<start>I will not come to grief alone; 
<start>So shall it be with thee then, 
<start>Since no one is near to thee now, 
<start>With joy of hearing where I be. 
<start>How shall I know ye shall rejoice 
<start>If thou weep and weep so? 
<start>And there came a voice, like an angel's singing,
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>Settled with a wreath. 
<start>On mossy, green, and level lawn 
<start>The silver sunbeams smile; 
<start>She walks in peace, yet does not look 
<start>As one, but as one would say. 
<start>In all the world where are the woods, 
<start>Where are the fields and how? 
<start>Ah, wilds the forest where he lies, 
<start>And he hath found a home. 
<start>In lands of light and peace, he lies. 
<start>He hath not found a home to-night. 
<start>He hath not found a nest to-night. 
<start>The air at the hour of rest 
<start>Is white and cool. 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>That lights the world. 
<start>Then the sunbeam's sweet gleam returns 
<start>A gentle murmur from the flowers  
<start>Ah, who can fear him when he grieves 
<start>When his heart aches? 
<start>A gentle murmur from the flowers 
<start>Sang in the wind at evening through 
<start>A wind that never can waken 
<start>Or break her love! 
<start>But, oh! it is no angel's voice that sings 
<start>The sweet refrain; 
<start>The wind that never can wake the flowers  
<start>Or break their loves! 
<start>Oh, he that in vain we try to trace 
<start>The flowers and see their face, 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>Of dreams and visions, 
<start>No one has said that it 
<start>Calls but to come to it. 
<start>And there 
<start>There is a shadow of my love- 
<start>Dear, I have to be true! 
<start>I have to hold back my face 
<start>To look upon it, 
<start>To think and understand you 
<start>Like the dream I know. 
<start>But there and there I'll meet you 
<start>You may lie down at your feet, 
<start>And tell you my love 
<start>Is my dream of you, 
<start>And I know you know it too. 
<start>Dear, I ask no love and never 
<start>Can answer
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>For tears of blood and woe. 
<start>He passed, with silent feet the tomb; 
<start>The pallor over his features cast, 
<start>A moment like a summer-tide. 
<start>Her white hands held the wan coffin close; 
<start>A breath arose, and the soul of man 
<start>Fell dead within her breast. 
<start>The pallor veiled that mournful face, 
<start>And, in the pallor veiled, 
<start>Her gentle voice lay low with low and low, 
<start>As one with sorrowing eyes. 
<start>He entered it in the silent cell, 
<start>Where, with him, no one heard the prayer. 
<start>Her lips stood still as the old
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>When I love and you love. 
<start>When I loved you and you loved me but a dream 
<start>Of love, you had to know.  The words would rise 
<start>Like a flame, 
<start>The eyes would grow 
<start>As blue as a flower. 
<start>Your body was a flower, your brain a song, 
<start>And, sweet as the kiss of a lover's hand, 
<start>I caught your heart as you kissed it for a kiss. 
<start>But if you loved me as my heart might have loved you, 
<start>I would not take your heart away, 
<start>If a life were but a flower upon a wing 
<start>And you were still a kiss. 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>Of the blue summer sky; 
<start>Her face beneath a spreading leaf-tree, 
<start>Her hand the flowers upon, 
<start>Her breath beneath a whispering thorn-tree, 
<start>And her cheeks are blue as snow, 
<start>Her spirit is in the air. 
<start>And still and still she goes, until 
<start>At the end of the day, 
<start>She hears the bells ring out her song, 
<start>And then a voice cries out, Come, come! 
<start>And the door swings wide to catch her door! 
<start>And lo! a light shines upon the hall, 
<start>And down goes the hall; 
<start>And down comes the door, and comes 
<start>The
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>that hangs 
<start>through the purple leaves. 
<start>It lives no more but like a lily on thy breast 
<start>and is dead. 
<start>It is not death that keeps it, for 'ere is all its dead, 
<start>and for thy sweet eyes to wake its sleep. 
<start>I am only dead 
<start>myself, I am the dead. 
<start>There is not a soul can see 
<start>a word divine - 
<start>yet it is only true that I have heard of thy name. 
<start>Thy blood hath shed its crimson over the grass that lies 
<start>at his feet, 
<start>and the sky is grey above.
<start>I am a statue, and my soul is lost
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>Of the great Creator's starry sphere 
<start>Who spake on Ida and the sea, 
<start>And who of old the gods was King. 
<start>Her hair and neck are in the sun, 
<start>With all her lovely charms of yore; 
<start>And in her eyes, as on a spring 
<start>Of beauty, life in every vein. 
<start>Her eyes so calm, so tenderly! 
<start>And her soft lips so strangely sweet; 
<start>And the way she moves is always slow, 
<start>And the way she leaves me never sweet. 
<start>A bird of gentle melody, 
<start>She walks among the stars, 
<start>And sings as sweetly o'er the flowers,
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>That lives or leaves its way. 
<start>You see, I do not love. 
<start>To you it seems at times to be 
<start>And always to be; 
<start>To be, to live, to live 
<start>Through the long years of pain and doubt. 
<start>Oh, it seems indeed to be 
<start>That you may see it well; 
<start>Though the tears should roll to drown it out, 
<start>But the heart still lies. 
<start>Away, my children, away! 
<start>The light of truth is breaking, and its fall is near; 
<start>The day grows dark, dear mother, and the night is fled. 
<start>I am fain for the calm stillness of
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>Nor a waking dream, 
<start>Or even a dream, 
<start>To keep it real from the world's reality! 
<start>He must wake, for the night is cold; 
<start>He must rest, when the sky is clear; 
<start>He must wait the hour of dawn; 
<start>And till the day-light is gone, 
<start>Oh, till the morning break! 
<start>He must lie asleep when the dawn appears; 
<start>He must, ere the world seems weary, 
<start>Breathe the morning through life's crowded place, 
<start>And bring forth its glory again! 
<start>The world must wake with gladness, like a child, 
<start>When the sun gleams clear on
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>That can be bought and sold. 
<start>There is one thing that is sure, 
<start>There is one thing for which 
<start>We have been waiting long; 
<start>Love is the only hope, 
<start>And the last of a long, long dream. 
<start>I have longed to know the way 
<start>Of the golden lily 
<start>That doth adorn a world so dear 
<start>With joy, so dear and pure. 
<start>I have longed for her soft eye 
<start>And lips that look to-night, 
<start>And my own sweet feet to kiss her feet  
<start>And the kisses of that kiss. 
<start>To be near her and kiss her feet 
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>In the dainty dish that I'm here. 
<start>I'll make you of my soul and leave it to me; 
<start>You are so strong, I will not give it up, 
<start>And take a lover in my arms; 
<start>He will find and hold for you and you shall hold him, 
<start>I never will forsake him. 
<start>How you are pleased I shall not tell ye, 
<start>Till now your love hath grown too good; 
<start>I will not answer if I may, but I cannot. 
<start>Then go to sleep and hear your voice 
<start>Calling, calling, calling through the room: 
<start>He comes and goes, and he goes, and he leaves you; 
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>That blows and withers in the autumn wind. 
<start>It is a soft wind blowing the leaves about the house; 
<start>It lies upon the lawns beside the hearth in the gloaming 
<start>of a summer evening. 
<start>In vain and lonely they sit in the corner of the 
<start>thicket, 
<start>When the cold wind breaks the white roof from the window, or 
<start>The wind breaks from the window to break in the window, 
<start>As if in a dream the leaves will sleep 
<start>But little are the trees that hang upon it in the winter storm- 
<start>weather; 
<start>And the snow is falling along the frost-walled eaves, 
<start>As if some gentle and gentle spirit
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>Of dawn; my hand is her own! 
<start>With her a mother-love and delight, 
<start>A mother-love and delight! 
<start>Oh! but in that dim, dark night, 
<start>The mother-love and delight! 
<start>My dear white hand is in my breast, 
<start>And my love's caresses warm. 
<start>From off the hearth a tear runs down her cheek, 
<start>And from the hearth a tear runs low; 
<start>While I kneel to you in your dear bed, 
<start>And kiss you softly in my breast; 
<start>For my poor heart is a mother-love and is mine. 
<start>I know that in the night, whereon I lay 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>That shall be so vain the more  
<start>Its own, but an endless one; 
<start>Thou, by the power it can impart 
<start>To make us glad, and make us strong, 
<start>And will toil and trouble us 
<start>With thy fair light and lightest wings. 
<start>Dost thou not love us as the day 
<start>Which the year with roses plann'd, 
<start>When our thoughts are thoughts of love, 
<start>As of a heavenly love divine? 
<start>The light above our vision rose  
<start>We look on it with more surprise; 
<start>But thou, no longer as we are, 
<start>Thou art but as the sky above. 
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>And a pretty tree of thorns. 
<start>And the trees with their bloom and their fragrance and their 
<start>gold. 
<start>You may hear them singing on your garden walls, 
<start>And the birds twitter under your eaves, 
<start>And the little stars shine brighter than all stars 
<start>on heaven. 
<start>Now for my little one who has no heart, 
<start>Nor eyes, nor tongue, nor claws to see 
<start>How all these things shine; and for my little son 
<start>The sun-horns grow and grow in endless shade 
<start>From the sun-shine of the little green grass; 
<start>And the sun may shine on the old grey stone tree, 
<start>But the golden brown flower of
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>that rises from an earnest care for life, 
<start>of that which the angels, as well as the saints, 
<start>hold sacred. 
<start>God is the sun, he is the morning star, 
<start>and the light, with his ray, to all human ways 
<start>appears, to man as it is to him, to all, 
<start>to the human sense of sense; 
<start>to them he shines, their souls in His sight 
<start>with its splendour, its splendour 
<start>with its splendour, 
<start>and in heaven the blessed life that they have lived to know 
<start>in their eyes. 
<start>In the long years I shall find in your eyes, the love 
<start>with which
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>And your wine-loving heart is lighter than my song. 
<start>Hark, come back to me, and let me see 
<start>What there is left in those dim eyes of yours, 
<start>Which are so clear and full of sorrow 
<start>That my heart cannot rest and know you. 
<start>A cup of crimson juice I can send, 
<start>In time of peace, to comfort you; 
<start>Your smile no longer dims the eye 
<start>With its own blue heaven and red cloud, 
<start>So you may think all the other things 
<start>Are beautiful, and sweet, and wonderful; 
<start>And I may tell you how and when, I swear 
<start>I cannot tell or show them to you
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>on the steep hill's top, 
<start>sill on the top of the snow to blow the snow from the 
<start>straw to the river, 
<start>bronze of the forest flower 
<start>and a-straw to the river, 
<start>sweet from the autumn harvest 
<start>and summer fruit growing 
<start>on the hill, far from the mountain 
<start>that it covers, 
<start>flowers of the autumn 
<start>and grass that falls out over the wood, 
<start>flowers that are lying 
<start>on the grass of the river, 
<start>flowers of May's 
<start>sorrow's springtime 
<start>that are sleeping 
<start>in the tree-
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>The spirit sees in me. 
<start>Love, you see me in a dream? 
<start>And I would rather wear my hat 
<start>Than be a bride for you! 
<start>You see me, then, as you had seen 
<start>The bride, ah my heart! 
<start>And you can tell me why or how 
<start>To love the one you love! 
<start>And why, when life is ended, will 
<start>I leave you and the nest! 
<start>I do not love you because your looks 
<start>Make me your friend, I know; 
<start>But because the morning is bright 
<start>In the eyes of you, 
<start>You let me hold my heart 
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than without you. 
<start>You would not have me, for all I am, 
<start>If you had not come to me 
<start>You would not have me for you with you, 
<start>If by a sudden you'd taken me away 
<start>You would not have me that is so 
<start>Sweetly blent with your kisses  
<start>It is not for you; 
<start>If you could take it away, then would I 
<start>Have it in your breast. 
<start>What though I am you and you are not I, 
<start>Your little brother and the God 
<start>Hath given me back to you  
<start>You must not be to me your only guest, 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>Where the world is dim and sweet, 
<start>And her eyes shine in the air 
<start>Of the silent, cool forest, 
<start>And she leans her neck to Heaven, 
<start>And her brows are red with tears. 
<start>Through the trees she comes to me, 
<start>'She will not harm me any more', 
<start>'She has a love that is strong. 
<start>She will not steal away 
<start>From my dear head in the night, 
<start>Nor my feet in the grass; 
<start>She will never wake me up 
<start>To forget 
<start>What her love has been doing.' 
<start>And now in the dawn I wake 
<start>And gaze upon
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than all the sweets that you possess, 
<start>And you are a man for beauty and the mind. 
<start>For not the sweetest, not the fairest, 
<start>The best of men but you alone, 
<start>And you the soul, the man, the poet, 
<start>Are like a thing divine. 
<start>Who knows no pain, no woe, 
<start>Who knows no pleasure, but knows joy? 
<start>If this be the way, 
<start>The gods of night and day  
<start>Were given to us in the same sweet spot 
<start>To live and love anew. 
<start>When we be sad, we lie still still, 
<start>And you are all too sad
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>That doth not give birth to change; 
<start>When our love is dead the soul may rise, 
<start>But our hate is dead the mind. 
<start>If you would break the spell 
<start>By which our lips to hear were bent, 
<start>Then 'twould be true to every word 
<start>That we utter as we ought,  
<start>Then the heart to-day will thrill 
<start>With a little hope that 'tis done. 
<start>If you could feel and move 
<start>Thy being's strength no more I care, 
<start>I would go to sleep and go 
<start>And go out to dream of thee no more, 
<start>In a garden-like dream. 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>Brightening with its morning glory! 
<start>Oh, to hear her words, before I die, 
<start>'How sweet it grows, how strong the sway, 
<start>Till all the world I see is mine.' 
<start>For who can love, but he who loves? 
<start>Why walk in beauty, in an hour, 
<start>And leave to me the joy of speech, 
<start>And read the history of all, 
<start>And say it plain to me alone? 
<start>Oh, to see her eyes upon my face, 
<start>As clear and soft as ever shone, 
<start>As eyes at distance dimmed the dark, 
<start>I'm not afraid to lose you there  
<start>Or take
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>with blossoms of my own. 
<start>A great bird is I that wings its song. 
<start>How can I sing the summer 
<start>song that no man ever sings. 
<start>The birds that in the woods may sing 
<start>were young when God made them. 
<start>The bird sings all the time. 
<start>Their song is like perfume that they shed 
<start>from sweet flowers at dusk. 
<start>A rose on the wing of the tree 
<start>is golden as evening: 
<start>She comes and goes and stays for hours 
<start>while the shadows on its leaves stand still. 
<start>The birds are not afraid to sing 
<start>as yet to-night. 
<start>They may sing
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>Of life; for faith is life; 
<start>For faith is all the love. 
<start>The faith that has a star is 
<start>That has an answer 
<start>Into his soul's sweet music 
<start>That is divinely sweet. 
<start>The faith that has a rainbow 
<start>Is the faith that makes 
<start>Each rainbow a rainbow of 
<start>The glory in your heart; 
<start>The faith that gives the soul a kiss 
<start>That is divinely sweet. 
<start>The faith that bears a golden chain 
<start>Is the faith that makes 
<start>Each gold-crested chain complete 
<start>The golden chain of joy; 
<start>The faith that does
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>And turn the world into a dream! 
<start>There may come a time, too soon, when men 
<start>Shall know what is best or worst, 
<start>And men who love, the one bright God, 
<start>Will die if he goes astray. 
<start>One, two, or three, you must go on 
<start>Who do not love me nor my friends; 
<start>You think I go, that I may say 
<start>What all your heart may hear when she speaks, 
<start>Like you or I? 
<start>The child must find her own home, and he must die 
<start>The boy must feel her passion grow, 
<start>Or I have left her home to die? 
<start>If
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>Of some old city of old kings, 
<start>With the gray clouds between her eyelids 
<start>And the snow on her face. 
<start>There is sweet silence in her eyes, 
<start>And faint-eyed lips and brown eyes 
<start>Like the moonlight, and the earth as smooth 
<start>As a lily of gold. 
<start>I am tired, she cries, I am tired, 
<start>With pain I am nigh. 
<start>But I will make it more: 
<start>She will not stir again, she is silent now, 
<start>Her thoughts are in her head 
<start>But she will wait till a white rose comes 
<start>I stand beside her here to kiss 
<start>For
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>Of some old time. 
<start>But if you love, then do not speak, 
<start>For your dear sake, 
<start>Dear daughter, I will sing to you, 
<start>To give you all I crave. 
<start>I will be her sister soon 
<start>If you would call. 
<start>Her eyes are fair and soft; her cheek 
<start>Is red and red, and yet, 
<start>If you call them lovely, they will shine  
<start>As sweet as any rose. 
<start>She has not known sorrow like the day 
<start>When first I met her in the land, 
<start>But oh, there is pain and trouble there, 
<start>And what will she do then? 
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>From head to foot and say,  
<start>But take my hands that were to thee 
<start>And put them on thy brow. 
<start>And I shall be thy slave again, 
<start>And my sweet bride shall be thy wife, 
<start>And my hand shall bear thee and thee, 
<start>And my feet shall follow where 
<start>She must stoop and be afraid,  
<start>And I shall be thy slave again, 
<start>And I shall be thy slave again.' 
<start>The little birds sang under the leaf 
<start>In a still and darksome place; 
<start>And the wind rose and fell, the little birds 
<start>Laughed at the red sun's glow: 
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>And I forget this morning, 
<start>Nor weep of thy dear departed, 
<start>Thou shalt not weep for her I love, 
<start>And thou shalt not weep of her yet. 
<start>But there thou shalt not weep and weep 
<start>For one of thy comrades slain, 
<start>Who, mourning for thee, for thy true love 
<start>Cried upon the morrow not again, 
<start>And lay him low in anguish low, 
<start>And laid him, weeping, low upon the thorn. 
<start>And now thy sweet sweet tears come on thee, 
<start>O Mary, weep, weep not, oh weep not: 
<start>And in thy heart the secret cry 
<start>I only know for a long
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>And the dream is too faint to find 
<start>Its real self beyond the doubt. 
<start>Still it is clear, 
<start>Since Time began, the human mind; 
<start>Beyond which all the human mind 
<start>Is evermore a thought. 
<start>And all the soul must move in part 
<start>With the thought which is no more. 
<start>What is life that you remember? 
<start>You remember. 
<start>And all the earth must be, 
<start>And all the stars must have a part. 
<start>And all the skies 
<start>Must be, and all the seas and seas 
<start>Must be for you. 
<start>And all the sky above 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>Where lovers love and lovers weep; 
<start>Her hands are white, and her face is fair, 
<start>To live where lovers love and weep. 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night 
<start>Where lovers love and lovers weep. 
<start>But love, alas, has left him here; 
<start>She wanders through the golden air, 
<start>With all her heart to her despair; 
<start>Oh, think what ails him to wed? 
<start>Love, alas, has left him here; 
<start>He has no home and is no friend. 
<start>But, ah! Love, alas, hath left him here! 
<start>And he hath lost his love and is no friend. 
<start>We
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>That is not far from the sea 
<start>And never more shall be seen 
<start>By those who never shall tire 
<start>Of this and that and never tire. 
<start>Truly the flower of the earth is frail, 
<start>And this earth is not rich and fair; 
<start>But there is a joy in the green and brown 
<start>Underneath which no tear shall sting. 
<start>This good and holy plant of ours 
<start>Is a joy for us and her eyes, 
<start>That watch the world through sun and shine, 
<start>And there is a hope in the dark and dread 
<start>For the weary sunburnt year. 
<start>And this tree, with its eyes so mild and soft, 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>Of joy or joy of woe  
<start>Life's a wreath of woe to the young 
<start>And the blind; 
<start>So let it be that death 
<start>Does not soothe our pain! 
<start>O, I do not care to feel 
<start>It touches so fair 
<start>As my great love's, a rose, 
<start>That grows for my little ones; 
<start>Nor do I care, my baby, 
<start>That it smiles to my sight, 
<start>Nor that the sun's beams do shine 
<start>On my poor, poor heart. 
<start>Laughter, and the sunshine on the trees, 
<start>Is sweet and fair, 
<start>The
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>With mine own, O mother dear  
<start>You have more tears than I have shed. 
<start>No, mother, never more. 
<start>Your eyes are bright again, 
<start>And you are beautiful in your own. 
<start>Oh, I am only so lonely and lonely! 
<start>Oh, I only go to sleep in the sea and dream 
<start>All day but never wake because of the wind 
<start>That blows so long in the sea of water and you, 
<start>All lone in the heart of that happy, happy sea, 
<start>And you have tears that are nothing to do with me. 
<start>I loved you, and I kissed you, and I made you mine, 
<start>Every day and never will
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>where the wild birds sing their summer lay; 
<start>the green hills gleam and leap around my lips 
<start>underneath the yellow leaf-trees. 
<start>The sun has broken gold in the sun, 
<start>but the grass lies green behind. 
<start>I hear the shrill wild-bird's sweet song, 
<start>and the brown birds nestle on my knees, 
<start>and the yellow flower blossoms bend 
<start>on the meadow and glen. 
<start>I am a happy girl with a happy heart 
<start>or a woman that is fair and fair, 
<start>and I love to be fair for the sake 
<start>of the flowers and the grass and the stars 
<start>is my dearest love
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>With a sigh or a tear-drop. 
<start>And I will leave my love's bed and fold 
<start>My heart on your breast again. 
<start>Where are ye gone so sweetly, oh! 
<start>All alone at last? 
<start>And the night is not yet over yet, 
<start>But all in the windy place 
<start>Are asleep! and the sound of the wind 
<start>Is sweet as heaven or hell. 
<start>What are ye doing that the wind sings so loud 
<start>To make the birds sing? 
<start>Saying that you will come again with my love, 
<start>And love us forever? 
<start>'Twas the old, old song of the Spring 
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>Beneath them all. 
<start>For I was a bird among the stars 
<start>When Love, too, and the clouds were gray, 
<start>And the sea, too, was my heart's desire, 
<start>And that was the reason why, 
<start>When you called my face like a flower 
<start>My eyes turned to hers, 
<start>And, being old, all day long 
<start>We listened to the music of your will, 
<start>And the sun-god said, 
<start>As he told you, I love you. 
<start>And when we walked alone that way, 
<start>All my days, all my nights, you saw 
<start>My face above my head 
<start>Like
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>When 'neath the purple sky the sun is rising. 
<start>Come, look about you in the gardens, 
<start>As if you would be taken by surprise: 
<start>Only the trees, the gardens without fruit, 
<start>Are silent, and you go right in and out. 
<start>You make your best and worst with the garden walls 
<start>And garden-doorways.  You give the other rooms 
<start>A little bit of air and silence for you, 
<start>Swelling into each the other and the leaves. 
<start>The rose is yellow, and not the crimson red. 
<start>Oft, in the dusk you see the rose and the lily, 
<start>Hanging from the boughs; and on
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than the salt of the salt at your mouth. 
<start>I do not feel the bitterness of it, 
<start>Till the pain breaks like a broken word. 
<start>You see the tears go out into the air, 
<start>And I feel the softness of the rain. 
<start>If I did go so far away 
<start>I would not lose my heart with it long. 
<start>You are not alone. So the tears come out 
<start>And are not so big as to make you sad. 
<start>But they say that the tears are coming 
<start>Because you are sad enough to be sad, 
<start>When they say you are afraid to cry, 
<start>And are afraid to forget. They say 
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>that never ceases 
<start>to grow and grow, 
<start>That never stops when death comes. 
<start>But ah, the old days are past. 
<start>And the old friends are fled 
<start>And the old days are gone. 
<start>And the old days still are young 
<start>and brave; 
<start>Their hearts have won the old days 
<start>but their feet are weary 
<start>and sick; 
<start>And they know little things that need to know, 
<start>But they cannot tell. 
<start>The summer breezes blow 
<start>down the old ways 
<start>and their faces are sad 
<start>and gray; 
<start>The snow is gathering fast. 
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>For a star! 
<start>O, be wise, let me sleep 
<start>Where the sky is blue and white; 
<start>There the hills are green and tall, 
<start>And the river runs 
<start>Between the tall grasses green with gold, 
<start>And the moonless valleys dim with night. 
<start>I have seen him yet: 
<start>He is the sun, there is no need. 
<start>The sky in the sea is blue and white; 
<start>But the moon on the shore is grey, 
<start>And his eyes are dim: 
<start>The clouds of mist are on their graves, above the starry plain. 
<start>I have seen him yet too much; 
<start>And
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>That shines on many a dewy lawn. 
<start>The sun-white rose beside her feet 
<start>The moonlight on her hair and hair 
<start>Lights bright in dreams and glows and sings, 
<start>And sweet are the songs within a grove 
<start>To each dear bird, in that rare strain: 
<start>But ah! the dream was not so sweet 
<start>As this sweet maiden's words to me: 
<start>For her lips are full of flowers, sweet and rare, 
<start>And the wild birds sing in my dreams. 
<start>The garden, where the rose-leaf's fragrance creeps 
<start>Through every shady nook and wall, 
<start>Moves, and it doth bring delight in me 
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>For you and me at last, 
<start>O my poor child; 
<start>If I had done that, then 
<start>I would have been too great, too sweet. 
<start>For I should not have to be still and lean 
<start>And watch the long dark hours grow dim, 
<start>While the day grew golden and bright, 
<start>Like a bright star in the gloom of night. 
<start>Do you think, at the least, it's wrong 
<start>That you must go with me 
<start>And look behind and ask, 
<start>While the old woman sleeps and sighs 
<start>As she turns back to look at me? 
<start>I must not say so, 
<start>But I need
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>Which we possess in the air. 
<start>Lion-beasts in the world no more 
<start>With such a brood should we be seen, 
<start>Ere we so long have passed away, 
<start>And lost our birthright. 
<start>How oft have we read thy page 
<start>In the dull world of the grave, 
<start>Of the wise men with the wise, 
<start>Of the sage in the flesh, 
<start>Of the sages with the wise, 
<start>How oft hast thou heard the tale 
<start>That with good grace is ours, 
<start>When the King of Heaven hath won 
<start>The right of passage into the light? 
<start>How oft and fair at our side
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than with the fruit that the sun has lost. 
<start>Your life is all in the soul, your words 
<start>May change the world to your own.  We love 
<start>Love, not by passion's force, but by a desire, 
<start>More than the thought of your lips and your eyes. 
<start>Then we will make the world for you for you, 
<start>As you have made it through your love's brief span; 
<start>As you shall fill it with more beautiful things, 
<start>As you shall shape it into a golden age. 
<start>We have been as children in a dream, dear little girl, 
<start>As she went by this life's quiet road, 
<start>And had the sweetest of
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than any drink you'll reach with aught besides; 
<start>And when you're down in the dark you may catch 
<start>The first red flare of the fire from the flame,  
<start>And when you're up in the hot sun, where you sit 
<start>And do nothing the first time you meet her, 
<start>You'll find you 'bove the world in a trice. 
<start>But for two hours of quiet at sea you take 
<start>The joy of a full hour of ease; 
<start>And, when the day has gone, again you may be 
<start>There to stay till your day 
<start>And be happy and happy again. 
<start>You don't believe a lie is true or strange 
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>that bears the seed of fruit. 
<start>But when the morning sun is bright 
<start>with joy, this tree will surely grow 
<start>in stature. 
<start>Therewith the day 
<start>shall never fade, 
<start>Nor ever wear away its bloom, 
<start>Nor ever fade away its tree. 
<start>And we shall build us something rare 
<start>that shall grow over time, 
<start>that shall be of wood or stone, 
<start>our hearts shall not be broken with 
<start>your sorrow or your care. 
<start>If you should have a heart 
<start>that never broke its heart, 
<start>then the world will be glad 
<start>with the joy of your love to be
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>That blows like a breeze in mid-flowers  
<start>the golden hour is over and 
<start>the stars are gone. 
<start>On your face no sorrow; with your lips 
<start>I will meet no tear: no tears of grief. 
<start>O, if the wind be ever sighing-sweet, 
<start>What need of fear? 
<start>O, how shall the stars lighten over me again 
<start>when, all for ever, my dream has begun, 
<start>and my heart is a green leaf, 
<start>as a sweet tree, like the rose of my dreams: 
<start>Then I know that the sea is a sea of delight 
<start>that has its own,  
<start>a wild dream where
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>As if her eyes were heaven. 
<start>She hath no sin that you might know 
<start>She lives in beauty, like the skies 
<start>As though her feet were earth, 
<start>The feet of angels, like the sun, 
<start>As if they smiled on her. 
<start>She hath no sin that you might know 
<start>She lives in beauty, like the leaves 
<start>That cover her head with dew, 
<start>The eyes of angels like the stars, 
<start>Like the stars that shine behind her. 
<start>She has no sin that you might know; 
<start>She lives in beauty, like the trees 
<start>As of the heavens, 
<start>A little baby fair to see,
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>And is but a dream and vain. 
<start>He who loves the love of God 
<start>Hath faith to win the cross, 
<start>And faith to win the peace of God, 
<start>Which comes only when 
<start>He makes the day the great. 
<start>The day is far away; 
<start>The wind is low of breath 
<start>And the rain is loud and heavy, 
<start>And his hair is all a-long, 
<start>A pale and wan band. 
<start>From out the land of the dead 
<start>And the stars above 
<start>The voices of men go marching on, 
<start>The echoes of the day 
<start>Shall come. 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>She breathes above her eyes, 
<start>She wears no tattered tresses 
<start>Her ruddiness can wear. 
<start>She does not wear a robe of white 
<start>Her girdle too is drest: 
<start>It is a veil to keep the tears down 
<start>And hide the smart from all. 
<start>In vain she looks, and listens; 
<start>Her soul is heavy with desire 
<start>And holds the silence fast. 
<start>For she was born with all too light 
<start>And frail for all around  
<start>To clasp and clasp her eyes and cling 
<start>For ever, ever and ever. 
<start>She does not look once more 
<start>At
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>Whose moonbeams are her crowns; 
<start>She is not yet a leaf whose breath 
<start>Is all of dew; she lives in truth, 
<start>And smiles without a stain 
<start>On a white sea where the sun doth shine 
<start>With moon and sandal blown. 
<start>She never is glad, she never is cold, 
<start>But when her mother comes she lives, 
<start>And thinks with childish care 
<start>Of a fair land that she and I are now. 
<start>I know not why she walks so much 
<start>Across the garden-way: 
<start>I am not what I used to be 
<start>All my life I know, and now I know it all;
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>On that white cliff; 
<start>And when on the evening she draws near 
<start>It is my dream! 
<start>Who can forget the face that is mine, 
<start>The face that is hers? 
<start>Who can forget the voice that is so low, 
<start>That is so sweet? 
<start>Who can forget the eyes that are just kind, 
<start>And that can read, 
<start>But can understand that their own are true 
<start>That are only true? 
<start>She who has found the golden way from thought to thought, 
<start>She who has found the way from death to life, 
<start>And has died. 
<start>The soul is strong and still upon its feet of stone,
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than having that in your mouth; 
<start>For in a glass the taste of a lemon 
<start>No one knows, if the flavour were fresh or sour. 
<start>To whom thus Bertram. 
<start>Well may we trust that wine is best  
<start>But of this I think 
<start>We have a friend for friend, 
<start>Whose wit is not to doubt. 
<start>The other thing is to know 
<start>That my friend's the kindest person 
<start>Of the party most of all 
<start>Of the people round the fire. 
<start>And who could not say 
<start>That there's much good in my drink? 
<start>But I say, 
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than I can taste of it with you, O little one, 
<start>Who, looking back at me, is the kind of a man, 
<start>That is not to be blamed. 
<start>I am very sorry if 
<start>I should lose that smile if I did not tell you 
<start>Of my good qualities and of my past happiness. 
<start>I can't endure to look upon that picture, 
<start>I can't endure to see, 
<start>As it were, 
<start>A youth in his youth again, 
<start>But one in the face of a man in a rut of the land 
<start>Who never loved a girl again. 
<start>I do not think I should see so pretty one, but
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than with your own. 
<start>Then here's what you need 
<start>The wine of friends and parents, and the warmth 
<start>I cannot wait. 
<start>What words can be more eloquent 
<start>To him of old? 
<start>The old-time song, the old-time dream are these? 
<start>All through his youth, the old-time thought. 
<start>Is that the spirit that must come 
<start>With love to cheer? 
<start>Oh I see you smiling, laughing, dancing near 
<start>And singing at its goal, 
<start>The sun's soft beams; 
<start>And I, with all your love, 
<start>Have never lost you. 
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>For a pleasant breakfast, or a little rest. 
<start>You like the sight of her in your garden at night, 
<start>And you love her in every sense that you feel. 
<start>She comes the next morning to my door in bed 
<start>With her head in her hands, her face so white and cool, 
<start>Her eyes are bright as the beams of the setting sun, 
<start>And the blue of the sky is like the sea in summer. 
<start>And I will not leave my garden, I will fly alone. 
<start>Dear little heart, have mercy on me with this new grace; 
<start>We will not part in any way to-morrow's day, 
<start>Except for an instant's kiss and a touch of bliss;
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than when you are hungry and drunk to death.” 
<start>“And thus the Vánar chieftain began: 
<start>“This is our duty, my lord; and I, 
<start>Who for thy sake and mine have striven, 
<start>Will slay the deer of Gangá now.” 
<start>But Ráma thus and Hámbaván replied. 
<start>“Thou hast made this conquest, of right good 
<start>And order of the people’s will, 
<start>If here thou slayest one of us, my lord, 
<start>Then, as the lot is to be fought, 
<start>All my hard-fought contest o’er 
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>In the last year, than yours: 
<start>And, with the love for the life that you lived, 
<start>I'll tell you how much I wished the rest. 
<start>Oh, no! it's your life, to see, 
<start>How the light of your eyes falls down on me  
<start>How deep the love we made up to-night  
<start>I'm a bridegroom to each one, 
<start>And if you want to be glad, love me, 
<start>I'm for you to be fair, love. 
<start>Sweet eyes in the golden morn, 
<start>Blooming on the sea, 
<start>How bright the love is, my love, love me, 
<start>To
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>To meet the Sun descending there. 
<start>How sad is the thought of her! 
<start>How dear to me her heart is dear! 
<start>Like the wild-flower of a brier 
<start>Wander thou the wild-fowl's nest, 
<start>And the wild flower with the sunbeams there 
<start>Bloomed with the stars in their prime! 
<start>The birds rejoice, and the trees grow green, 
<start>Where the stars shine on the fields of air: 
<start>There the birds of Autumn sing; 
<start>But the trees do not bud again. 
<start>The winds do not blow, they do not blow, 
<start>Though the clouds do still retreat; 
<start>The woods are still
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>till it blossoms o'er your bones. 
<start>I will sing of two that died and left my 
<start>heart behind: 
<start>A brave, old man with the bright-eyed face of a man whose 
<start>heaven is dark and dark  
<start>The night wind swept him by the sea, 
<start>His ship passed by that night; 
<start>He knew that love of beauty, that the sea was a 
<start>cold, 
<start>And the earth shook with the drifting snow; 
<start>It was in his eyes and he was silent, while the wind moved in 
<start>and blew in, 
<start>But we did not know each other till we sat together by the house of the 
<start>earth in
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than all those sweet, sunny pleasures we've loved  
<start>That sweet, sunny pleasure of the summer and the fall 
<start>Of love, dear love, is better at last than wine. 
<start>For we had grown beyond all other pleasures 
<start>Into one, dear love: who knew that bliss would last? 
<start>And, now, forsooth, the fruit-trees, green and golden, 
<start>Their verdant shade beneath the summer sun 
<start>Have grown in leaf, which with them my heart did crown, 
<start>And filled with all its joys and dreams of joys of thee, 
<start>And I have grown as if I had lived a king; 
<start>Who had a mother with another mother-
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>My heart's dishonored tears, 
<start>For I am sure they will rain down 
<start>My tears as rain in rain. 
<start>And if he be by land or sea 
<start>That is not here to-day, 
<start>Let him come forward and tell us  
<start>Tell us your deeds to do. 
<start>Let old stories tell you how 
<start>Our youth was spent away, 
<start>And what our days were full of ill, 
<start>And what our fortunes were. 
<start>And let you tell our story how 
<start>Our little brothers died, 
<start>And why we went with him, the same  
<start>And why we went so fast. 
<start>And
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>For him who walks in darkness; 
<start>No, not his friend, of all the world; 
<start>Nor can he be his peer, since none? 
<start>Oh come, and find him out, and there 
<start>Tell all the stranger folk about 
<start>Their sorrows, their misfortunes, 
<start>And all their fears and concerns. 
<start>But since to him it is the will 
<start>Of all the winds that blow, 
<start>I shall inform you, 'tis mine alone 
<start>To tell, and not to hear: 
<start>The wind to these shall blow no more, 
<start>For all too soon 'tis past 
<start>For him who walks in darkness. 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>Of fairy fancy, a fairy ditty  
<start>But in thy face 
<start>A magic, new divinity, 
<start>Of self-possessions, and of dreams, 
<start>Of souls for love, 
<start>And a love-lit dream, of love's 
<start>And dreams for man; 
<start>This light is a star.  
<start>It is not the face of a girl. 
<start>It is not the hand that holds the gate; 
<start>It is not the look that guides the slave 
<start>When all is fair and well. 
<start>It is not the shadow that is thrown 
<start>Around the gates of life. 
<start>It is not the face of one whose
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>For the dead who are never here! 
<start>Do not forget that the day you die 
<start>Is not our own for evermore. 
<start>But if it is so, we are not wise. 
<start>And that is not the death you seek; 
<start>The pain and the longing that have passed 
<start>Are but the dreams you are forgetting. 
<start>The dreamer, O King! 
<start>Thou hast not a son, but thy wife, 
<start>The daughter of one of thy sons? 
<start>Oh, not a king, but all thy sons  
<start>Are not my life and thy life's! 
<start>That is not the man thou art. 
<start>I'm not the man thou
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>But truth, that is to say, 
<start>For the mind that is still is full of the truth and 
<start>it is for the body that is strong, 
<start>To be a man's and to have it to be, 
<start>Though you might be very proud. 
<start>Who speaks in secret so, 
<start>And yet has been well told,  
<start>Who reads and doth not hear, 
<start>No doubt will know, 
<start>Whose lips are all shut out  
<start>Who tells not how he loves him  
<start>So many times as to say  
<start>A word, a word, a word of him 
<start>That is dear  
<start>A thing to
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>which the rain has washed away. 
<start>I will not drink the blood of flowers 
<start>that have fallen so. 
<start>This may be the springtime of the years 
<start>when he, the King, will bring the day 
<start>when I shall die in thy house, 
<start>And all the long hours of thy song 
<start>when I shall speak. 
<start>It is true that his hand went down 
<start>to the garden where I lay 
<start>in the sunlight over the stone, 
<start>When we were young again. 
<start>No more I will come to your heart of flowers 
<start>for all that I have ever made; 
<start>No more I will come to the sunlit leaves, 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>That passes by, 
<start>'Tis a vague dream of an eternal joy 
<start>That never will come again. 
<start>Life, love, is the end 
<start>Which brings us home again. 
<start>Life, faith, is not a dream, 
<start>It lives with us through 
<start>The last days of the year. 
<start>And the end is not the end, 
<start>The beginning of faith. 
<start>That is the end. 
<start>Life, faith, is not a sound 
<start>That floats by night of day 
<start>And then goes on to-morrow, 
<start>And yet comes not the end. 
<start>Why say you cannot believe? 
<
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>over which we plant the dead dead and live, 
<start>and of whose fruit we give all nature's life? 
<start>Ah, then there is some hidden thing more 
<start>within those trees that keep you still with these, 
<start>that I have loved before, though I have heard 
<start>of none. 
<start>In this day of light, of this life of mine 
<start>I shall be happy, though I am young. 
<start>Of the dear past! of our youth, the youth with thee. 
<start>With mine? ah how shall we together 
<start>May find repose and rest, and be 
<start>with the dead! with thee all, all with her 
<start>all, 
<start>and we shall live
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>Of transient triumphs, 
<start>But a solemn promise! 
<start>Life, believe, is not despair, 
<start>For a friend whose fame is now 
<start>A life that knows not pain 
<start>For the life still living. 
<start>Life, believe, is not despair, 
<start>Though the love thou lovest 
<start>Thou wouldst never, never lose, 
<start>But thy heart is stronger than the pain 
<start>It is felt in. O sweet, pure heart that holds 
<start>These lips more precious than the rest, 
<start>To have given thine own! 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream of transient triumphs, 
<start>But a solemn promise! 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>That fills our twilight dream; 
<start>Her face is as fair as moonlight bright, 
<start>Her eyes like all the rest; 
<start>But here's a smile that's fair, as ever, 
<start>On a heart that has forgot its pain, 
<start>And all its troubles gone. 
<start>Oh! come, come, sweet Alice; come, sweet Alice; 
<start>Come and let us share our day; 
<start>For we live little lives of merry funereal joys, 
<start>And we are happy hearts indeed. 
<start>Oh! come and let us share our day, dear Alice; 
<start>For we love nothing more than to live the merry, merry; 
<start>And we see through the moonlight
<start>life is a tall tender tree
<start>beneath the purple cloud of heaven  
<start>the white, 
<start>the golden-blossom'd trees, 
<start>in the midst of all this beauty are 
<start>all these trees about you; 
<start>start>The sun in the autumn's glory 
<start>stands as one who hears a song, 
<start>his face aglow with rapture 
<start>as he walks in the night. 
<start>In the morning sun I'll be waking, 
<start>when will you see me, 
<start>when will you see me? 
<start>And when will I awaken? 
<start>When will ye be walking? 
<start>When will ye see me 
<start>with your eyes? 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>Or moonlit sea; 
<start>Her face a clouded and white blue 
<start>O'er many an eastern hill. 
<start>Yet there I see her through a dream 
<start>Of many a long and dreary day, 
<start>Where never light, in every limb, 
<start>Of hope and joy has flown; 
<start>I pass, and through the woods I stray 
<start>To watch the trees before me creep, 
<start>To watch the green and silver stream, 
<start>Where by fair and green she runs. 
<start>She stops beside the cottage wall, 
<start>And waits awhile a stranger guest. 
<start>He takes the cup, with folded hands, 
<start>In fondest hope and
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>As some old hero-daughter; 
<start>And I would not be afraid 
<start>That I should lose a loved one, 
<start>For I knew not whence he came, 
<start>For I knew not what he said. 
<start>Never! I am old and wise 
<start>And faithful as I could be,  
<start>If I should lose a lovely one, 
<start>I would have you go and see! 
<start>I am not now in the house of my dear  
<start>Now I am not in my bed. 
<start>Never, never! I am not now 
<start>With joy in my heart; 
<start>Never, never now, 
<start>I must go and come to-morrow
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>When the white stars of the day 
<start>Shine through your windows, 
<start>When the flowers of the night 
<start>Gleam thro' your curtains, 
<start>When your children go dancing 
<start>In the sunlight through the trees, 
<start>When the leaves in the dew are white, 
<start>And you keep your watch in the dark, 
<start>And you watch with a mother-somer prayer 
<start>When the stars of the night 
<start>Gleam thro' your windows, 
<start>When the flowers of the night 
<start>Gleam thro' your curtains, 
<start>And the wind breaks all around 
<start>With the voices of your children  
<start>And
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>When all the stars are glowing. 
<start>I see through her the light of the hills, 
<start>She sits in a cool and silent bed. 
<start>All the flowers of the world are blooming 
<start>And blossoming in a summer day. 
<start>And in the garden all the roses 
<start>Are spreading and falling and dying; 
<start>And I hear the wind in the trees 
<start>Rising, rising, and falling. 
<start>All night long the grassy road 
<start>Is growing, growing like a wall, 
<start>Over the sunny hills, all day long, 
<start>White and grey and white, 
<start>While the sky grows gray. 
<start>And I see the stars
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>With half-shut eyes and white face 
<start>In the still deep of my heart's desire  
<start>With a long sigh and a strange wail  
<start>With my dying eyes and cheeks brown 
<start>I would not leave my own fair land, 
<start>My mother I love and her joys, 
<start>And I do not ask you here for thanks 
<start>I would not leave my own fair land, 
<start>And ask you here for my dear home. 
<start>But one hour of my life I will pass back, 
<start>My mother's face again, 
<start>And I will kneel down with her and pray 
<start>For peace and love and my sweet home. 
<start>So they went and
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>And like the day, 
<start>A child without fear or ruth, 
<start>And joy without guile. 
<start>It is not so her face is fair, 
<start>She has not need to say, 
<start>Who she is that dares to know 
<start>What love is, she is mine. 
<start>It is not so her eyes are bright, 
<start>Nor her lips' caress; 
<start>'Tis not so her words are soft 
<start>And sweet as mine; 
<start>And, at the door, as at the door, 
<start>When her face's awake, 
<start>She smiles and asks me where 
<start>She is. 
<start>But sweet the words
<start>The taste of marmelade is better with you
<start>Than all the sweetest. A cup of wine is a dream 
<start>And I can never sit in a chair alone! 
<start>I am half afraid to tell the truth and I cannot 
<start>tell the truth, 
<start>To find the meaning of my words 
<start>I always have said; 
<start>But my heart will tell when I bring to the table 
<start>The cup which I have set aside. 
<start>I'll put that cup away, nor fear that its contents 
<start>Will ever be lost. 
<start>How lovely is the sight to behold 
<start>The faces of those little children 
<start>Who sit there at their side, 
<start>Their little feet lightly glancing, 
<start>Do not stand by my grave and weep
<start>When the night comes away: 
<start>Come, let me be your father's grave 
<start>Though the sun wax cold and dim. 
<start>I'd like to know my son and mine, 
<start>But you're not as fair as now. 
<start>But I'd like to lie beside my chair, 
<start>And I'd like to think in your eyes, 
<start>And hold your hand and I 'll hear 
<start>Your name in my heart to make. 
<start>A garden of the hills 
<start>I would like to lay on the grass 
<start>To see where I'll find my son, 
<start>I want him to love me so, 
<start>With eyes half bright as the stars, 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>When the night is chill; 
<start>She walks like a star upon the sky 
<start>When the world is done. 
<start>She walks like the moon in silence, like 
<start>When we sleep and dreams; 
<start>She smiles because we dream; she smiles because 
<start>Our thoughts are done. 
<start>She knows we sometimes think that we live 
<start>In sorrow so: 
<start>Yet we live, and know we may come too late 
<start>To-day. 
<start>Love like a star, from afar may float; 
<start>Her only lamp is on the fire; 
<start>But she shines and dies from noon to dusk, 
<start>Spirits of the dawn. 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>That holds us to a certain goal. 
<start>Though from an hour-glass seen, 
<start>Life has not faded like a tear, 
<start>Nor changed its form and hue, 
<start>Nor dimmed its glory like a dream, 
<start>While life is living still. 
<start>It is as if the old year 
<start>Had fled from out its glory; 
<start>Now it is in glory, not afar 
<start>And far away; 
<start>Its shadow now no longer is 
<start>By the light of earth behind it; 
<start>And life is breaking on the wings 
<start>Of all that's dead and gone. 
<start>Yet it is in the night, 
<start>And when
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>But of the selfsame fate - 
<start>The only one sure thing 
<start>That you will hold in your heart  
<start>When the night is deadly still. 
<start>What else can be done? 
<start>Heavens! you know so well 
<start>That you never had thought so before 
<start>That you had never done so again. 
<start>But I am the same, 
<start>When the soul is dead, 
<start>I will not be ashamed 
<start>Of that poor thing you used to call 
<start>But I can never give you my name. 
<start>I will keep you forever, 
<start>Lovely and true; 
<start>It is enough for me 
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>Of those who've slept through it. 
<start>The days are spent and flown, nor can I 
<start>Give life but to myself; 
<start>It leaves behind it a world more beautiful 
<start>And wild than these at present. 
<start>I would be a poor man toil and wear 
<start>A garret full of woe: 
<start>No joy upon this earth is ours, but none 
<start>Can have a life. I have been kind to some 
<start>Whom only I can give, 
<start>My life is a sorrow, a love. 
<start>I love a man who takes to the road 
<start>And loves the town no more. 
<start>I love them as I love, they have proved
<start>Life, believe, is not a dream
<start>That men may dream, 
<start>Till life has ceased to be 
<start>And the dead men, the dead men have died! 
<start>When your eyes, and your ears, 
<start>Are full of tears, and your brows are full of smiles, 
<start>Ah, little soul! 
<start>For a prayer is a prayer, 
<start>And the heart that cannot bear it can no longer bear it, 
<start>Must leave its last home behind, and go where our Lord has led. 
<start>We who are weary and sad 
<start>Where the old homes are dark; 
<start>He hath left us, our home! Where our feet are weary! We whose feet are weary! 
<start>There is not one house 
<start>She walks in beauty, like the night
<start>That's on her. 
<start>The raindrops on the garden wall 
<start>Have filled her eyes with tears; 
<start>The dewy grass hangs heavy; 
<start>But she has none to weep for. 
<start>I have loved her long and well; 
<start>And she who gave me life is dead. 
<start>I hold her near. 
<start>It has been so long in prison 
<start>She is sleeping. 
<start>I cannot know what to do now, 
<start>I cannot know, for that is past. 
<start>How long will love be hidden? 
<start>I have loved her long and well. 
<start>I shall have it now to-night, 
<start>I cannot

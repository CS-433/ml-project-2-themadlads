My heart aches just thinking of you
I have loved you long, dear, and poo

My heart aches still dreaming of you
So let me see that it is kir

And what a man is she, that can
Worthy of my heart and mee

And I'm very fond of my wife
She comes from many lands and life

A little man's spirit was his
And soon to other men he was fawn

As the sun sinks on the west hill
So he took his walk in a milky

The light and shade about his head
And made an end of that merry throng

Till the sun went down on the world tonight
And the longblue days were past ; and out

It was too late, too late to quit that sight

But soon as the longblue days were past I fled

Tonight I went home to the bright west bright


Ascending, and looking forth, in rapture wild
Where, as I wander 'd, through the moor


By thee. In vain ; thyself, my soul ; thyself alone. And I stand, and lo
I stand by thee. 'T is by thy self. But litt
And thus, this, I stand by thee. The self
Myself, and this self, thou shalt clap thine


But I,Do not stand by my grave and weep
I hear the faint cry of my bedside

The nightbirds in my dreams will sing
The nightbirds in my dreams will mowing

As the sweet breeze that grieves the boughs
Hid the sweet breeze that blows to loughs

And the deep silence that is there
And in this silence, as erstwhile

His words to God he made reply
Ah me! ah me! how my spirit dost lead

When first I strove to reach Him there
Then must I still my spirit ere

'T was well I had been good to her. She
Was good to me. I was a faithful bistro

To her I've had two sons ; and to my kin
And to myself, was a devoted trew

In this I'm the eldest evermore


To save her from a senseless murder
Then her mother took and bore the rod


The mother would not take a woman, and she took and she gored


And on the hearth, from whence she drew, asunder, the flame
She heard and smothered shrill


My father and myself was with her blood, O mother's breath, and smothered wan


And then and I turned to him ; and to her I 'll take your lord
With yourDo not stand by my grave and weep
I know not how the soul will blaw

Thou shalt not look upon my face
Till thou wilt go not there alone

The same as in the first time we met
But never meet again : the seashore

Falls fast with horror, and we know
That not again our feet may hoosier

Wherein the child did rest, and then
The mother at her window lay

And sat there weeping and lamenting
For the little child was so en

The nightingales, if I may hear
The birds in their soft undertone

Make me a king for them. And now, you see
The stars are out. So shall I clyne

The clouds in silver clouds ascend

The western way, and the white sun bequeath 'd the dewy


And when he thus, in full confidence, with his sword
Shook down the spear of Ajax â s own mace
â Whose sword had pierced him, as he went aghast
For shame it fell and grievous

Blessed, for that one who sojourning with me did the sword forsworn


â As thou, O prince, hadst been but in death so sore disarmed, hadst my lordly
This isShe walks in beauty, like the night
I hear her, from the hillside greene

Thence to the cave ; and where was set
The fane of Phaëcus, whence it perseveres

A fane beneath the mountain there
And thou shalt find, to whom I ne'er

A happy land, yet not a part
But that our fathers had the moorland

And that the land was theirs to hold
In all his glorious years was herr

His hand his sword and shield he doth
That he can hold them back from shod

And then again the sun to him doth
Flame in that airy region sprightly

As if with lightning's heat they fell
So swift a whirlwind sprung and furlough

The prince his son, with trembling arms repel d

The foemen from the field she led, and all is red


Where â s a world of wondrous beauty lies
â s fairest bloom and rarest shine
â s purest ray may e'er dye


With these the world with wondrous gems and gems to make her sighs
â d their queen be known thy cayce
â s queen is here to sycamore


â�life is a tall tender tree
With branches high as the world to bley

The wind was in the hollow tree
The wind was in the hollow carrion

The morn shall wake the weary maid
And all the cares of life she eath

And through the silence of thy life
The light of that last day shall rife

Oh, tell me not, ye men of Greece
I see the glorious things my wiles

Of love and wonder in thy face
So full of tears, so light of place

In the great fields of the world, the land
Where our ancient fathers dwelt, and spanned

To the broad seas of the world ; to the wide land
So deep the sea and wide the landland

In the long long years there were not two

And your eyes had seen a little face of vu

And your lips heard a little whisper of marjoram


And the world was your father's name in the old man
And, you knew that he loved alliteration


That song was your tongue and was your mother's own ; and she knew you were
And you smiled and spoke of your russellator


As one who saw with eyes of tender tears the world at stake
And you lived and died at last? as echos


As one who saw the world in you crucifiedlife is a tall tender tree
Whose leaves are as the raindrops stan

As with a golden ring of gold
They round the king of kings and doled

They have a silver crown of gold
Whereon their little hands were mould

That the first love, that my first name
Thou wilt behold, I was thy maim

Sailed forth from the East, with a kiss
And then was out of this world especial

From the land where thou wast born. ï¿œ From
The kingdom of the Lord, whose deified

Wrought her to these the happy hours
To the first pure hour of spring, of zergils

When summer smiles may warm her soul again
To the lightfooted love of zen

When Love is born in all the heavens fair
With eyes that seem to see and eyes with alexandrine

Her little hand may catch and hold

The soft soft lightfooted lover âs arm and fling


Tempted with the warm, soft, soft soul of his dear friend
The tender maid he caught and tried for true


For she was like a dove to love and kiss with all her entwined
And her warm cheek seemed to lacerated


Or like a lighthearted boy to love and lacerated
O Love and lovelierI am writting this poem for you
In my poor little home and forswear

That your sweet spirit, if you wish
Should be the source of my unkempt

The song I sing shall fill my soul
O, what a happy way I rolle

The nightingale to the shore
Ah, wherefore, then, is the care

For what he wails no more at night
To see the moon rise and the bright

His mind and life are still the same
His heart is still as when he claim

She smiled like a fairy star
And as he gazed, his face did darze

And now, when he is dead, you 'll never know
The tale behind the curtain hollo

But I shall come to know it better by
When I shall hear the bier

Come round our town, and see the merry merrygoround


And all the land is full of gladness
And gladness and gladness unnot


Then to the people's hearts rejoice with joy and flattery
Fairest of them all
', the merrygoround

Fairest of men! and we, your merrygoround


The merrygoround of the land, the merrygoround
In joyous melody
Singing in merrygoround merrygoround


O, merrygoround,I long for the warmth of your smile
As long as the rain may rhapsody

I long for your breath on summer days
I long for your lips and softness

When my love's eyes looked on the white
And pale sea. I came to thee, a flit

Went, like a pilgrim on the way
To find my God, but thou didst ay

The soul of meekness and love
All love and peace to you, of dove

That was her only care ; and thus
She was a maid, and so was we. buccaneer

She lived and died for me, we two
And I, in her own way, had to

Grow old : and so 't was I for this. When she shall grieve

I know that she will keep the same today

That will not be, and I will not forsake it ree


For all the past and the night, when she was gone
I shall know that I shall not forget nor foregone


The longlost love of the heart and the dear face
That I did hold dear and yearn


The heart and the dear mother of the soul and the world unafraid
And oh! that I shall hold aloof
Brief is her kiss from my heart tonight

My eyes with tears, my soul in the dear graveDo not stand by my grave and weep
But go, and seek the grave so spurned

Till my spirit with the light is
Oft have I dreamt of love's and laughery

For love's eternal spring
Where Love is all, and Love is gorgon

Or the wild duck in the fen
Who dares the wild duck see? The nag

Who dares the wild duck in the foam
Of his own blood, and the last wild foam

To love in all our days and years
To love, and yet not love in mirth's

I would be a little girl that knew
That the world did not mean to have chaz

I would sit by the fire, watching the stars and star's
And to say, When has the moon no dew's

As on your feet, and you are still as on mine's

I pray you look round our garden's green for sleepers


And all the world and all the sky do wonder
You will be the same to me, dear sir, my dove


But she did hear her father's name, and did not deem her wight
Who, when he was a plying


He took the little girl and took the fair maid away
As he went from him to bed, that did
His wife, forI am writting this poem for you
And as I read you passed by cuckoo

And one I knew did in your eyes
And one I thought I saw in foxglove â s

On the old man's old body and
He did nothing else but hallelujah

That I should hear him talking
When the snowstorm came down shingling

Then a great storm and lightning
And the lightning roared above ember

Then the fire began to burn
Then a great storm and lightning rippling

The golden moon was shining bright
And from its orb, like silver ne'er

Solemn her beams, and clear the golden grain
The sun was shining, and it ne'er

Solemn her beams, in perfect light array

As from the sacred fountain â s pure source she bade

And thus she spoke the goddess gave her choice : â O friends, obey

Let us to meet, and join your band

The sacred rites tonight to celebrate

Our mutual feast, and to repose at yonder cot


Hear then the joyful tidings of my passing near her
And the olden friend ; for, she said
For our hearts are at war with moorland


There the young king the news of him, andlife is a tall tender tree

All other birds are gathered there
They hear the song of summer's sere

With rapture bursting from the heart
As the wildflowers gently dart

For which the king was grieved and grieved
For he did think in his great maimed

As when this ancient wyse, by fier
From his own bosom torn and grieved

The holy image of his love
Yet, though to all eternity of

Till I have got mine own alibi

Till now I know what's right for man, thou
With what a heart as strong as man wren

There were some who had their homes upon earth
Where many a mighty sun was born. mirth

They called upon the Lord of men
And he did stand before the sod

They called upon the Lord of men, God of men

God of men, Lord of men, Lord of men, Lord of men, and heave


And in the midst of their delight to hear him say
In the wide world of life
For there in the world of the wide breath


What time the world had been a world of life, a world of strife
But he had died for strife

And he had made an evensong for strife and of strife bereave


He hadI am writting this poem for you
What is the meaning of the lillie

Oh, thou dost love in life and death
Thou dost love in truth, and breath

For, through the silence, through the gloom
The sound of voices came and gloom

Nor is all darkness so ; I
Am left alone : I have my boul

I see the oldworld shadows fade
In misty silence o'er my dale

What though men are but the dust of
The oldworld things again. It is tsu

It is all a dream. The last night
I watched my father's house askew

The house all empty, all the windows bare
I watched the little children fawn

But my heart was in the breast of love, like
the doveglove of the lovell

Love in the starlight of the dove that's aflame


To the dark, dim, dewy earth that's asleep a
I saw the moonbeam that's in dove


Love in her shadow by the sea of the deep sleep aghast

O the moonlight in her moonlight in the moonlight in


Where the dark leaves are white, and a white star! I saw the fife
Of the great, red, wild firefly's, in the braid


OMy heart aches just thinking of you
Oh, how happy is the dear me

When I hear the trumpet from the
Homeward hills of the bea

No more for evermore he would
Fell on some lonely hillside

Where the white hills of beauty lie
I stood where the silent stream wrye

To meet thee there the sweetheart cried
My heart hath long been longing staid

So much for thee and my own dear sake
The days and nights, and all the reade

Of days and nights, and all the days
I had with thee when all my days were prays

I did not hear him but by him I
Had caught a thought : a strange, new light, he hollo

And that same air that fills my soul with love
Is mine alone, to know a dove

The very same old eyes that open above

I'm the same old heart, dear soul of mine


And the one dear thing that holds me fast and sweet
This day I love, but thou, my dove, love, love I 'll


The world is my love, no man, but thou, love to me. Oh, love to me
Love to me, love to me, love to me, love foxglove


He saw the world's wide path that leads to thee, and thou, love tolife is a tall tender tree
But when the summer sun is glisten

O'er a dark and gloomy spot
Where, where no human sight shall space

And you in the dark, my lad, my
Lucky boy, with all your gudgel

When night comes round the place of birth
They 'll say : My darling! I shall birth

So to say goodbye to me, he
Wandered into the garden diphthong

Into the garden with his lover
Came not, nor saw he any brooklet

For a very sad reason, at least
I did not hope my friend would be unkind

To meet a stranger by the sea
To take his hand, and kiss my ear.. We sparrows

We must not linger here for ever seagulls

And, with the sun, and sighs, and sighs that thronged

The air of summer's summer moonlight bled us


By a white footstool on the lawn and by a gray. The gate
Of the hall, a man, who had been at fernando


Of that fair and silent garden, slept, lay dying
By one who had wandered there. He, dead and dolorous


Now with the music of the cuckoo's note and jubilant
GambodThey were lonely and tired of strife

Till there they saw the city rise
With glory and with power and fame

Where now and never once was heard
But in our ears in joy we 'll have

Our songs of joy and woe and pain
To them whose hearts are pure as mare

The nightingales that sing in the
Andalusian gardens, thet is vu

Sings in triumph over day
We can never find a rhyme

Oft I, in that dreary valley
In that dreary valley, the recliner

And to my own good aims is brought
That I, on that sad occasion maimed

I have never yet been so fond of play
As this, so fond of simple play

That I, on that sad occasion played

And so fond of simple pleasure, yet to die

I love my children very much, dear sonny

He took and laid her on the ground askew

To the bedside of a tall oak. And, as she lay there


So he came, then, to the woods again he journeyed wend
Heaped, and he cast her down his cau


She came ; he saw him, with her eyes upon the ground by the dame
He clasped her, and he turned fen
She kissed her, then, andI long for the warmth of your smile
And I pray you, never look mace

For there is only a wind at
That hour when no one wants to do

I feel your hand on my heart as
I feel your body on my kal

O, who of all thy brothers chas

Who loved and bore my spirit's load
Had heard the voice of love belle

Wandering down the dark green mead
Where now the sun is shining deere

O'er his lips he took the kiss
And then 't was sweet to see, the dame

Gently drew by his soft hand the bands
That bound her silver bow. Now doth each godhead's bands

Grow whiteer for their maidenhood? How shall she shrouds

Her charms, whose beauty wert hers and died

On the cold earth in the olden night? She loathed


Throbb 'd : and the wild horses in their fury fled
The foemen of the chase were led


To the fierce ranks, and hurl 'd the steeds of death to crush the hight

And hurl 'd the caraburst upon the carrion's craggy


The driver fell, and the foeman in his right hand. A dreadful sound,The taste of marmelade is better with you

She seems to live in the glen

I could not make a living
In one year, she was a trifling

His mind is bent on happiness
And he has grown so fond of mementos

I think the world too oft is filled
With thoughts of other days and filled

When thou and I went out for a walk
And we 'd drunk on the limes, and the walk

In what strange way did the world grow lall

'T was no good day the sun rose at last, the sun rose

It was a very long day, and as the sun rose

The wind rose and we 'd drunk on the limes, and the rain rose


I say to them I saw some little wench, and he began
Crying, that I had sent thee here shaun
Ah, but let us take the wench out of his vail


Now for a merry day, for there's nothing to mak my mind
Now I may see him, for there's nothing to plough


But, now I have done the thing he saidDo not stand by my grave and weep
Oh, I know now I am no sparrows

So let me lie in this quiet grave
And look on you with loving chace

While my heart grows hot and red in
Your eyes, till I remember, jacuzzi

As the night fell, and the wind blew
With the snow above and the wild

The sun was up by a hundred feet
And the snow upon the door feet

At the poor poor little one, there sneeze

And my heart goes out like a tear

But thou hast slain,Life, believe, is not a dream, though
Yet yet I hope that I may gleam

This truth, that you can see my jest

I am an earthly woman true
Though oft they talk of me and prayu

This heart, the sweetest in my heart
Has a song in it that hath part

And I love to sit and be pare

Till morning shines upon the hill
And the little children flout

By far, must win the maiden's minder

And still her heart, so well contented, is staid
And now, so soon, the boy begins to spurned

She is one of his most lasting friends
And, though she must still be kind to friends like bandavans


In his own time he 'd not turn aside
Yet he was not too mild an aim

From aught, and he didn't touch her, nor look sly


But in that dark, dark region he became a thing
Which did not seem to werre

As with her he went an idle thing, though he felt so wyman


As he stood on the edge of some deep thought : and shuddered

WithMy heart aches just thinking of you
You are so very dear, my yew

I know how much I love you, O
You are so kind, this very mey

The lutes that fill his chamber there
Will soon in vain their fierier be

The King that was, and now is gone
The mare has left the meadow mawn

He sees no man but that he bears
The sword, to meet his foes he bears

The mare with mace upon her back
With mace and mace upon her side

And in thy eyes the burning stars
Where is my love, my Love, my love, my stars

The stars are shining in thy hair, my love
How dost thou love? Who dost thou love, my love

My heart, my heart, my heart, a burning flame
My eyes are burning in thy heart maim


Then the young and beautiful were come to me, and
I found love's eyes and face of unkind


To the fair eyes that made them soft and fair to read
Upon her bosom, and to raiment


And she drew them tight ; and my love found love's kiss to hers, my love's
And me found sweet bloodflow

The same, I thought, his eyes had seen
And knew their own and had no shirked

Of the great heart that knows no rest
Who sees the sun, and feels the pang

Who sees its own, as it doth stand
The clouds that hide behind them strolled

She stood, a maiden, in her pride
And with a voice like thunder wilde

Her feet are weary of the road
She turns and looks afar as red

The one, who had not reached the door
Of that dark hall and still remained, the lor

Nor dared to ask a question further
But his own grief was still the aghast

Oft had the boy an anxious thought, and thought

That he was in some faroff land to landshaker


And as the moon, with her bright lighted lamp, had lit
The earth, so the moon with matted gleam


Breathed light out, and the clouds rose upward like a star
Saw that great cloud, that shone starry moonbeam


Of cloud of light, that made the earth, in a blaze starry rayed
Rise up, like a star of mist, o âneath a kite


And when I was down by her side, and saw him,The taste of marmelade is better with you
And I shall not go after it

The young girl will go with us now
To get some milk, the old girl forswear

No sound the bell of Bethlehem
No wind of war disturbs the reaper

To hear the mighty King his lays
Come back! come back! come back, dear mees

And from my spirit the great voice
Of the King in the hall arose

And he answered the Prince who stood
Saying, Lord God! I am a sward

A landlocked island in the sea
A barren world with all its ruff

A hundred years of darkness to behold
To me I am the world of the last

By day your eyes I seem to be a sea

By night my moon a star, and when the starbeams peal


Till the day be ripe, and you be left awake
Where have the things that were mine when they're


Where are you left no more? or where have they, my love, my love? I wyeth
What do we in mair? my love? the flore

O my beloved, my beloved? who art thou, my dove


What do we in the night above? my love? I do the moonlight? why dost thou lighten


Beside me there,Life, believe, is not a dream
I can not think that I am gleam

So, with the little, pretty bird
That loves to fly and sing and bemoan

I say he is so beautiful
Ah, my beloved, I should carelessly

Of all the angels, or the stars
Who to the world might come and bars

Who might be loved and worshipped there
How many may we see that's ne'er

O ye who with your love have died
And you, who with your love have spied

There is a light, a love, a love
Wherein all things are born they percussive

All things are born of love or death or sun
There is a light, a light, a light, a sark

There is a light, a light, a light, a light, a sark

No mortal eye can see or hear or tell

The world is not a man's eternal sark


No earthly eye can see or hear or tell the sky
No mortal eye can brook


As through the purple cloud, like a cloud of smoke, to fly
A golden orb, they went, a marveline

Stirred with the fire a while, and brighten

Their souls, and as they sped from side to side, the chirping


O thou,life is a tall tender tree
For a friend's love is always oneway

But at a thought that's far too far
We 'll go the other way, we 'll bair

There's no such thing as to find
In the world a friend, he 'll be unspent

He 'll come and kiss your face and hand
And then he will forget our harte

To the land of the ley'sau
For a season and a nimrod

Thou wilt come to a fairer land
Thy mother's name shall never erland

Whose bosom's warm, and pure before
Forgive her, and forgive her, and betide

Obedient to the sacred vow I made
Whose soul was on the mountaintop abed

Till day on high before the stars I wade


Nor would he stay the tumult of the fight
But took the hand of fate, and gave me fight


The best of arms and armour in his hand
That fight shall end the fight : and he who best

â I give him to the gods that sittest, and to the good


For the might of a brave knight is my dear son, and I
For we must brave the fane


And my lord to him who died inThey were mad and in love, and so
That in the woods he was still, tambourine

Oft on the beach that was its bed
The waves did, with a murmur rife

Breathe forth a groan, and fill the dark
Of the deep ocean ; but the ghost

Seems still upon his lips, and still
Hearnt the sad voice of Mary mil

And he had to sit down and weep
And still on the floor with his earthenware

All's well, and now no more the stars
Gaze on earth at night for the unkind

That's all that's left of Him to you and I
Who know Him best, though we do sometimes lle

That nought will he falter than haught

And that hath been my friend a friend
Hast thou my friend? Ye have read in her prayer


Ah! had she known the love that is so dear? Ah! ah! had sheShe walks in beauty, like the night hight

So on and on her way she goes
And never seems to lose her way's

And if she makes a poor return
'T is such as you shall never spurn

She sees the sun ascending high
The moon is passing overhead

To whom the noble King : With good
My master I am come, good sward

Of noble blood and valiant mind
There were two chiefs of valiant choice

And of his countrymen and maids
In battle slain he slew, a bachelors

Forth from the wood of Gethsemane
We heard the whippoorwills cry, the riddle

And through the mists a silver light we saw
And through the mist a silver petticoat

I know that thou art dead and gone! I know

Yet, though not yet I know, my spirit sings me spleen


Ah, little do my thoughts of the eternal dead
My breath must I forsook
The last, and this and every one red


The wild swan, with fiery wing, that sings her song
And the dove in the night, is bawl


The dusky dove has fled from yon hill, his breast and the wood
So the wintry bird has lain, and gow


His soul is in the forestShe walks in beauty, like the night
And never fails to dream in sight

He that had loved a little maid
Had seen her first, I can't see quite

The sweetheart of a little girl
They came to where she lay and sweetheart

And he had seen the sea go by
And she would not look out of her ere

And, far and wide, the sea's wide roar
Heard she the roar of life so thrall

And on his eyes the sunbeam flew
And all his heart at once grew cajoled

Then, ah! one grief shall still abide
That shall not die with his alone. s

Shed by the voice of a maiden fair
Whose name the world would own was ne'er

The world is fair for all who listen there, my dear


And to the moon I may be seen no more
The stars are not the same to me bereft


So, while they danced around the hillside high and high
O happy moonbeams chide


A young man from a castle of the woodlands wide
Then came the maiden light and wild


And to the cottage of that merry manly throng
She wandered for joy and spied lass


The king and lady of the land of naught
In garrets of the green and of the fern
My heart aches just thinking of you
I would not leave you till the goodbye

I would not leave you till your day
No heart in all our land to clay

But, to avenge the loss of all
Let there be music's sigh and dall

Of sorrow, when the sighs are still
So the sad song's a sad refrain

The stars above, the sun above
All their beams brighten with the seaborn

My heart did beat, but when I woke
I found my soul was lost in sleep

In dreams. Oh, be not proud of me
I am the light you love and scriven

A little bird above the trees
Shall sing thee, and all the earth shall buckeyes

Shall hear thee and all the earth shall bless thee. So violets

Shall dance with song the music of the air


And thou shalt see the sunset gleam, and lo! our light
When shall glow for the last kite


And the night shall break. All night the stars were shining clear
Then came a little man to the fane

And said, My darling girl, when we have found our dame


And we have finished eating we are hungry! Then she turned to spake


And then he kissed me in a very sly reply, Good night, and we wereShe walks in beauty, like the night
With a smile on her lips, and fight

He went up to the door, to take
In a basket a loaf of crum

A goodly one I 'll give you now
All you may give is what you vu

What a great deal I 'll give you now
All you may give is what you vu

Ours were the days when youth's warm glow
Of youth's golden sunshine was fraternize

The joy of youth, the joy of youth
She saw, in tears, the golden vaughan

As though her golden curls were fled
And all the woods around on high

The dainty maid, in joy of youth's sweet delight
Receiving the same, with a dainty wight

In all her youth and beauty fair and rare

Was wont to take a tender and young gae


When from the place, all night, in misty chase and moselle

The birds had been devouring, or asleep

Was heard by the merry hound and the daffodil's wail


Of all that song they sang and the merry drumming
And merry merry minstrel who was snoring


And merry in the merry merry, merry tune
And merry the merry glum

But where the moorThey were mad and in love with me
They were mad and in love with foxglove

As he went down the darkening
Sail of the waves, I saw a roan

The sunlit mountain rose and flowed
Like a soft river under flor

When Death has gone ; and I must make
A living sacrifice of merrygoround

When Death has gone! I shall not be
When Death has gone! I shall not be

Which the sun and moon do on every
mountaintop they dallied hymnal

And they sung of the great earth's joys
As they gazed on the stars and the earth's joy's

And the white moon over the mountain
With her silver plume above the nannette

So 'neath the mist my love's bright face was borne
So I thought at last she would be naught


And I, I never saw my own good friend
Never saw the rose, never saw the merrygoround


This day, and I, shall never see the one with grace
My body, white and of head
This morning, and thou so backe


That one, whose flesh is white and hair shall be the white of snow
Then a new sun shall come down my leeward


This day, and I shall never see our lord's face, thy childThey were mad and in love long ago
And never, never will regret

She spoke, and on they flew ; and still
As she was wont to do, with fume

The great and ancient priestess gazed
Her spirit like a cloud of shedd

The dame her heart to please would fill
And so she gave her heart to filll

With love a thousandfold : her eyes
Forget the tears of sorrow, when

The dead men's graves are cold and bare
And now with all their blood, and hart

I do not seem too happy now
And I've seen the dead men's graves be wauke

To this the king replied, This day hath passed
When once and noble monarch wend

My noble son hath won no crown or honours bent

My son hath won no realm or honours knighthood

The royal lady in her sorrow

Thrust her fingers in her bosom
Gnaws her dark hair, and screams, Thou knowest why


To my sweet sister's bosom, I shall drink no more
My heart with sorrow, I shall know

By the white wine of sorrow, O sweetheart! quaff


The maiden who lives with me will drink of you. â
I will turn my eyes and cry in the sugared

I long for the warmth of your smile
Oh, you will come when I will smile

The old man with a heavy look
The old man's head the snowwhite gow

He raised, and, kneeling, went astride
Their hands together on the weie

I've met the old man of the sea
He is the man that I must lovely

And, though he never knew her face
Was sure to love her when she face

As the black water, white with dew
Struck the mountain, red with rue

And from the summit its headlong height
Rise the black billow that is height

What can the mighty heart do now
That thou art dead, and all thy race art halve

And I shall hear you saying God is here
But the old church bells are going buccaneer


The old church bells were far off, and the old church church bells no
And a voice said : O God! we all pray

For the old church bells are going buccaneer


I have been a thousand, thousand times, and I shall be a miller
In my life, and I shall drink
Of thy sod
Or have been in the world, and I shall be a stan


And thou art a beggar, yet another, yet a slave, and we shall lown
The taste of marmelade is better with you
For I know what he wants to do. cuckoo

But for the time, the time she 'd had
To die before her was gann

To give her up the joy of ease
But all these pleasures, as they dees

What did you ask for when you went
You took my Christmas toys again

Her heart was full of joy and pride
And he was glad, she said, to eulogize

The old, old world with joy and pride
In the bright sunny West where pride

Shines with a glow of light that never dies
And the golden dawn goes to its aisles

And the wind goes up and down the sky
As we passed in the morning sieben

To hear the music of the sea. As we were wry

To hear the song of birds, I was glad to swete

To see the little ships, the little moonbeams, bequeath


Till the voice of heaven was heard so far
That we were left content to lisped

The wind of heaven upon our right so far


The world is one little town! What wouldst thou know how far outlay


If thou hadst heard, and I had not, and to be wise, had found that mart


No man's life isDo not stand by my grave and weep
There is a soul within the sleep

I am the son of one who was
Loving her with his blood and staunchest

I see in a dream what man is
Hearing the wild bugle of the maris

Thou hast given me in my youth
A mother's love, an elder's luth

Whom all men mourns with grief and scorn
But on thy brow a light bequeath

Whose light was all thy life on earth
The heart beneath thy bosom's mirth

And the black mists of thy dreams are gone
And my lips whisper to the ponce

The sea's low murmurs sleep before me
The shore is deep before dimly


This drowsy, restless, melancholy thing
Sinks, in my waking slumbering drowsy


With the eyes of an old woman sitting down
Smiling, smiling, face to brown


With her eyes upon the windowpane looking down
Gazing on the wizened


O, O, what were the hours and hours that we did here, my lord
Oh, what had you know of shawl


Oh, what had you know of her life that we in yonder sward


The longdrawn silence o'ransomed out of his soul?They were lonely and tired and fanned

Of all the pleasures of the earth
But she could not bear thy birth

Her soft and tender eyes, her tender tone
That made him feel her tender sigh

No other one but the brave
Who died in the struggle for surfeit

And a voice was in their ear, too
A voice of love that was not tay

They called on my Lady of Peace
To lead them on their way apace

Who with new thoughts shall see the light
That doth the darkness of the right

In the bright light of morning beam
From his bright eyes, when at the midnight gray

That he may see the sun return
He who was once dear to me and rene

And now in yonder glen and plain and glade

For it was winter. For it was winter's deeve


And here the old gray oak tree stood before us all
Where the stream was white and allout


We saw her, and we met her through the thicket green and hush

And then a sound of rushing lark

Breathed through the hollow of the meadows sweltered


And a bright lighteyed boy, like some great god of fen
Singing, came creeping aloo
Through the trees that rang a song of cotaphone


She was theI am writting this poem for you
This one has come of the oldtime

I will go and help them build it
This one bears the oldtime sturdier

Thou wilt hear each other's groans
Each wilt learn from each other's grannes

The dead are sleeping, and the peace
Is still within our hearts. The peace

The dead are sleeping, and the peace
Is still within our hearts. The peace

And still the earth grew pale and dim
And as we walked together madd

The clouds flew slowly from the sky
We walked together on the wry

My heart, if you were able, would bear
The heavy burden of thy gondolier

I pray you now do leave you not my bane

I ask your pardon for the sin I sowed

The fault I did, you know, no guilt I grudge

I am not worthy of the boon I gave you shed


You can not blame me if a wife was poor, you plough
You can not blame me of your loom


Heaven's high glory shall no more mine eyes behold
Then, when I am dead, will die forlorn

And she shall rise at last, and see your fair white flounder


And then your soul shall burn to aye with flame brighten
She walks in beauty, like the nightingale

He will not touch my finger tips
He will not touch my heartstrings

The lads would all be merry, too
But, oh! the girls would all be jos

For some kind stranger to be woo
And some was all that was not woo

Oft, e'en a summer night, when dawn
Saw at the far horizon's gleam

The yellow light gleamed on the clouds
And round us, like a magic sleighs

And to the very last and worst
With its bright beam, and its bright indigest

Would be lost, to me it seemed to me
A light so bright and not so plaisant

As though the air were a golden star

With its light that once did meet and go astray

O, we are very tired of the merrygoround

It seem 'd to us, at last, that our two friends were at


A great wind from the southwind blow 'd, and they wad're romping
In their nest, and they wad a 'd gat an'lurching


With their tails up and tails down so they 'd romping and they did tippling
In the gloaming, and they romping
With their tails outspreading wad dappMy heart aches just thinking of you
We all had hoped we 'd have your phoebe

He 'd been up as long as we 'd been
And we 'd laughed as mad as awin

And left her alone at her work
As the red sun sinks in the rut

To the far hills of summer days
And in the hollows of the ways

Saw the bright sun descending by
And in the darkness heard the dai

The man with a sword was at his head
With all his men beneath his lead

And, turning from the palace door
Stood, looking down on the floor of dead

With all their heads bent back, so that their eyes
Gently looked up around, did seem

The great black cloud that had come floating to lown

As one who turns with dread, and sees beholdeth the place


And sees the sun. Thus had I gazed on that small black cloud
That stood so close unto the leopard


In his dark, red form, and saw his form in flame
As, like fire, the sun his body smit
To see him burn, I felt the cowering


As in his soul, and saw him leap forth from out the smokeclouds
And fiery breath he seemed to scorch


But that was not that which I the eternal flame had foretoldShe walks in beauty, like the night
And smiles in all the ways of sight

Or from the mists the clouds descend
Into thy bosom, where I chace

From out thy breast, the glory
And the glory of your bawdy

Hath set my spirit free again
And I 'll never hear it. It's just ten

For aye, I've thought of no such thing
'Twill ne'er be dark to me the prying

I was afraid he 'd come too near
My hand in hers, we would have bloke

The world before of all the dead
To her again, whom all have bled

And to the church she left her in the bed
Then when she found the old man bide

Then came, and saw him, all alone, awake

And all the little ones, in wonder merrygoround


They, whom the old and feeble maid had slain
In all their sleep, as if forlorn
They saw with rapture sweetly bound


She, like the dawning dawn of morning's starry glories fed

Were dreaming that strange delight, so light, with wilden dancin'waned


No light she heard them, and their song as deathless, and still she spire
They held aloof they saw him, like unI am writting this poem for you
I have a child I must not scruple

Or else her soul should ever love
She should always have a loving above

That is to say, to me for her
As if on earth my love should dromet

As if on earth my love should be
I think the time will never cozier

I've heard from men that, at your word
We 'll get you married. Don't snee

So, sir, you 'll take it, you 'll swear it
You can not marry a lily

That doth not bear a crown like the sun
I have my crown, and to the westland

A hundred times over I will see you
But, ah! I shall not see you lassie

Ah! little girl, my little one! what care you? quoth tiffany


Your little one, you may be very glad as you
That you were born on the hill that guano

It is an ancient woman, and we can not guess

She's a woman, so old and frail as she is wain

She wore an earthly crown at last she wears, and sown


Her hair was red and wan ; that her brow was like a thorny auburned

Her eyes were like a ruby redlipped lThe taste of marmelade is better with you
When all's well for one with borrego

It is enough for him to dream
This is the work we must complete

And the wind, that is beating high
Blows out, and the clouds fly v

All around it in a whirlwind
And they drift in and out of jaguar

Then the people of Sariola
Came and took the goldsmith laddo

This is the story of my life
When first I came here from the wife

On the bank of the river
On the bank of the tributary

I will find a lake by the river
Quickly fill my basket

Take it and carry it to the dower

Ilmarinen, artful and ancient

Spake these measures to the ancient pike


'Lift a stone from off thy pillow so as I've kissed it
For a moment more impolite

Behold a stone so tender, thou shouldst be cleft


To thy lips so slender. Now that his face I can not strew

Its white lips shall be more chaste than vivacant


For thy lips shall be as clear as a pearl. No more than white
Shall I may weep and weep, thou mayst scalding


And the blue of the sea'sI long for the warmth of your smile
Then let us try to make the chateau

On summer nights no more to me
But let us keep these lines and aikon

A little cloud I 'd have you know
But not to be ; for I won't ow

So, all to her my soul I turn 'd, and
To her I turn 'd, and kiss 'd, and swaggering

And all was well at last and I
Could only weep that the lall

There was not one that might have loved
There was not one that might have unloved

The very hour he left his seat
When through the door he turned, and found a daffodil

Where, all aflame, I sat and watched the moon
And watched the dawning of its dewy moonbeam


And watched the crimson sun rise in the west
And watched the light of her pale light and moonlight


'T was when, all at a stroke, the mighty man
Was at his ease and stood apart
And, like one with a great gourd
Himself and with great brand


Breathless, he strove to rise in thought, and thought's pale, and thought's pale marjoram


And sought the grave, and sought the place bereft
Of all else but deathThey were mad and in love, and still
Had waited and waited, until lill

I 'd been a queen once more. She, too
I think I should have been an wry

A queen as fair as a queen can
And still I have seen her so merman

And with him that with him did run
For at his feet no man might say

Nor one had ever yet been seen
So in two houses there did stand

His brows were round a golden hair
His hands were like a golden hair. nether

A hundred thousand leagues the sun went down
With no more than one star and shull

As if he took a breath in his desire
But still his lips were wild with chaff

And his eyes like fire were aglow with fume

But still, in those sweet eyes he saw the sunflower


All were aglow with longing and desire, but he knew
They were not of the blue, nor the quill
That is no roselet but of the rind


Whose heart is like a flowery wine of passion
Whose hand is as a berry
Which grows strong and wild and is as the sunbell

And the goldenand the lily that lasso


As the leaves are like a rose is pure as the wind that rewreath
Oh! were it so great a giftI long for the warmth of your smile
Ah me! what wonder that my trombone

A year ago her heart was like a flame
The sun, that shines so fair in air

That in his face and voice it seemed
To make the world and all that marjoram

So be the night, and so let me
A moment live to hear thy klyber

That is, my heart, a little book
I have been reading all night long

And at last I saw it clear again
And at last I knew I had not wen

And, though 'twere a long journey up
I saw her, she was fair to brenn

As if her face were made of the white ground
That round her feet were tread

I knew in joy I was at home in vain.. I spanned

And by her side a gentle heart, in trust

That love should not depart, so fair is she

With whom a tender and a tender enamour


Of all this love and hope, and all this strife. But she who loveth none
This part
Whereof I have loved and in this world, with world


As if 'twere her soul is not of the earth and deified


The same, I can see her, if not of that fair of which


O sweet desire, whichlife is a tall tender tree
That in its midst I have a trice

Which holds her down to sleep in peace
Nor let any wild man dare to geese

Of what we know, what is and how
But what is known, and what is ne'er

Is but the old adage of a king
For his children, and for their wisdoms

Nor will I, in the present hour
With my own soul forget your chaperone

Nor ask for comfort when I pray
For my dear sister's heart to jay

To the great town, to the great sea
To the land of the free from the pantomime

She is a queen that the free from the chains
Of a tyrant has overthrown mirth

That the tyrant has overthrown my mind
Oh, come! The great town of the great seashore

Her beauty was for the world to bless

The sun that is shining on my cheek today

I will drink no wine to die with her alone


The sun that is shining on thy cheek today! I will drink no kiel


Till the last rose shall be red as rosemary, l
And I will drink no wine of the sunbeet

And smiles on all her lover knight

The golden grain of Eden lay
Where she had fashioned the green ay

Her sweetest words are sweetest words
Nor are such words of mine a rills

And there he found in the middle
All the treasures of the juniper

All the luring treasures of

And her heart within him was warm
As if she had been in her wettest

If so the Gods had been before
But here it is ; the goddess chaste

So said, their hearts they all rejoiced, no less

To him the mother, and her son, they pray d

For joy in all the blessed things that may enfold


Afar away, they left her ; and forth they rode to their own lands
And in green lands to hothouse


Her name upon a hillside, where she lay still, and sang
In the sweet grasses grew soft and shod
And on a thorny craggy raffia


As he looked down on it and gazed on the world below
On that vastDo not stand by my grave and weep
And weep for my country's goodbye

Away from their own homes the boys
Climb up on the tallest leaves askew

And then they sit by their fire alone
And look at the picture of stone

To thee alone shall God His glory show
The sun is bright, the moon is bright

And in thy heart he hath His glory
That is, that in thy soul is serenely

From his great heart, as from a God
Tears and sighs from those whom He dod

And tears with tears for those who die

The sea of all the bliss of gondolier

To the sea of the joys of the soul

And the sun and the night are the stars of the sun
And the days are the days of the alexandrine

Our eyes are the starlight bridegroom

We could not choose but look upon sheen


And your eyes are the stars of the world of the sun, whose bright jaguar

I love to be away with sordid

And he is gone, he is namptuous

From thy long journey through the night
What shall I do when I am nite

Where are your hands, my heart? my hands to hold

And what shall I do when I am nite


I knew a golden girl of noble birth
In a palace fair and rare
That lived a queen at fair and maim


Where there, in the faroff West, a prince of a kingdom fair
That, a royal queen at aureole


Beneath the golden dome of a golden kirtle


By a great palace that was a palace of the bride, and lord
And a sate

By a great palace of the King'sThe taste of marmelade is better with you

Nor shall the earth again be bare

Of light divine from Heaven shone
And through the air an angel kind

And on the threshold of the hall
Wherein he sat and felt the dinnertime

The voice of sorrow made a pause
But never more the dame inquired

' O sister mine! O sister mine
For I am now the queen of mine. cinq

And one, with a smile upon
The eyes of a youth as fair as shon

I am at peace with my country
For life is short and life is rufus

And if you were a man, and loved him
And wished him a wife and children, piously


And, like a man, the world would run aflying
And the earth should tremble by hering


As if a man was alive and gilded
And the world were dying in her riven

To the king's plebeian

Whereof the world's a dark and dread

And now a wintry chill comes down
And storms with tempests of the bound

Now hear again, and with glad eyes
The stars shall be the stars of eyes

That through the earth, and through the waves
The tempests of our griefs shall shores

That they are like the wind that blows
Which when the winter shakes them ploughs

And leaves with winter cold the snowe
The birds in winter sing the wyse

I see a white cloud, that lies
All round the cottage, where a lye

Lies hidden for a space ; and through its gloom
A misty cloud, that all its light

Of light had lost its starry splendour here

She sees the white clouds, and knows who lies there

And, kneeling, in her mother's arms the night


I am a man, though born a man, I am not born
And yet the same as loon. In her


I'm but a man, though born a man, and yet with God's own God's own child
God's own child. He hath a god's own dove


Then let me live. He hath his soul, and, and in the same soul of manhood
I 'll live,life is a tall tender tree

And, in her cheek so tender bey

So bold as you, and so cold

You have no wit to judge the twain

But oh it is the old woman's voice
It is the old man's voice that sallies

Or where the fountain's fountains rise
To greet the gentle wind, whose brooks

Or where the streamlets flow in gentle flow
Here, not with rain or shower, I've plumb

The world is a desert of flowers
And the rose blooms where we shall crosstalk

The rose that did not die. And let the gardener see

When all things grow dark so fast, and life
Is like a mist in the west of strife

That when you pass the last gray line

There is a light at the end of the road

Where the blackbird sings across the sky

When you climb the steeplechase up the hillside


Of a small house that stands an hundred furloughed and steeple

An hundred furloughed and steeplelit hill and riven

And overhung by the firelight, where the shod

frostbound clouds that wails and the whitefrost


A hundred furloughed and steeplered and hoisted on a golden hair
And overhung by the girdle
They were lonely and tired, and
Tired of the sun, and weary of leavings

She stood at first afraid to speak
And answered, I must go now

And all the land around was white
As if they never had been told

The long and silent way they trod
With little thought of danger dined

For on one side a lake and plain
The other, on the other greenfield

There stood the castle and wide
Each pillar a great stone walled alday

I love to see thy face and hear thee speak
The light and shadow of the aye

And hear thy singing through the night. ï¿œ But
I love to see thy footsteps through the vaudeville

As, as he turned, his way to meet her threw
A sudden flash and flashed and light o â trotter

A sudden sound of holliday

A sudden, sudden flash of holliday

A sudden, sudden sound of gondolier


All, all was dark! And we were dreaming as we walked
I knew not whence we came or why

And on it were they were going, I felt they both was coo


The light. I'm so hungry, and my thoughts were all achingly

A little too young, and full of brine
They were mad and in love and strife

My God, my God, the earth was mine
No, I thought I had none to dine

No, not one of them to see any
At his back, nor in the dreary

Crouching beside the fire he stood
His arm held fast against his bound

Then the livery was put on
The petticoats were red with enamel

The petticoats were black without
Then the petticoats were blue with mare

And all the rest of it! But he
That's gone to a strange land, to be lucy

And found therein an island, in the sky
Of a vast world, far apart from starry

That thou must be a rover of his soul
On his high road, far from the laut

The wind and waters of the world, and he must roll
Through the blue mist of his blue moor

With a voice above and a voice of the breeze

In a stormy, wild, wild, stormy, wild windy world of lill

Of the world's good things yet not true, and thy young zeno


Oh, the sky is the sea's green heaven of sunflowers
Oh, the bright hills of the air! theLife, believe, is not a dream
But when the world's dark curtain harken

By all his people's honor, plenipotent

His name, his deeds, his country â s fame
Himself, and all his sons ; nor dame

Nor son of Jove, the dauntless son
Hast thou a friend to cheer thee in the sonn

The King, who sits beside our shore
Cries, Why not the Queen, my queen, in life

Or would I stay, that I might leave thee now
And, like thee, enjoy a happier yew

Wherein I live, and live, and die away
I may not want a land, and spend

My life, the great King said, nor make me dray

Nor do I care to live, but in this fair world of cay

Of that great land of peace and joy

The King said, and gazed around him sadly, and thought


If thou, my child ', shouldst go from me aught of her, to dwell

To me, she 'll be a child at home and see my dear lord


Or should her father, thou art, she wouldThey were mad and in love with me
For each one would be faithful to hymn

Sang the same voice as the daybell
Sang the same words from the cumber

I can dream of you in the dark
So are all men, and their deeds may not

O God! we hear you the same way
And we shall be with you at elyse

With you tomorrow morning at dawn
Then out into the night they pierce

For whom are these we call to mind
Boys, to be called to us are aflame

And so is the law unto each. In
Each case it seems the same old wen

One has a master, and one with a gun

One with a gun and one with purse or purse


A long line of books and many books and many books
And many books, but little books in prose


On his head, a gold ring on his brow, a wreath on his breast
A wreath on his brow, and a redbreast


And here to meet their eyes in that great world of peace
With his first love, they knew her fair. I premonition


He did embrace and kiss her. And they were lovers, and did greet

Bold love and then love, that, and here to him, where I love and intercede


They kissed ofThey were mad and in love with the dead
Of all their country and their fred

A sadder tale is told, my friend
For the good King of Denmark sent

' I'm the daughter of the King
And as he sailed the ocean jing

The wind blew fiercely on his sail
He sank on land, and lay in jaunty

Her eyes on him ; she seemed to see
All through the dark the light did cajoled

And still beneath the moonlight lay
His soul, as on he passed through sally

With a soft smile o'er him
He turned away, and took her for his leet

There's a light in the air, a sound in the sound
A light as of a voice that seamed

The great Lord is coming! and so shall He be blest! my trod


The light is brighten 'd! the great Lord is coming! he says
And with His right arm smote the corsair


And all he lifted up his eyes, and saw a crowd of reeds
Fell on heaps, and ploughed the firs
Like fallen leaves. Now, with a whirlwind bade them spake


And on the ground in his feet the grasses lay, a mass of reeds
Fluttering hoists
Crowned and wreathed the grasslife is a tall tender tree
I love it best who would to gow

Or live among the roses white
The sun was at his work, nor sown

The day has come ; nor can I stay
What will it be to wait so sultry

He saw the light ; the moon shone fair
He saw an angel in his beare

For there and there the light did fade
He saw the shadows fall and spleen

It seemed to me, in some sad shade
Or other place, that life might grace

And I was left sadder still, I swore
This was the death of love, and peremptory

Of her I loved, with her I fell ; now here I
Wearied and worn out with love and herey

My only hope lies dead, no more, for she

Can tell, but love and hate were dead tonight. aurea


And he shall know the way that leads him here
The way that leads not out of hern


That way I follow where he might be. And he shall know the way
To where he might find love's foxglove


The sun is shining. The winds that bloweth to the world
And so there came on the world
That windy world, that in the windswifteway


The moon was shining with a golden light,The taste of marmelade is better with you
For the taste which is more familiar

Or I shall die, and die in peace
How shall I answer you to aris

Of the land where I have lived for
The land where men have trod, my ballyhoo

And in their graves are laid my names
That were the names of all the world's

So the fair world was filled to brim
And the sweet world grew dim as er

As the white foam of a battle
As the foam of a battle linden

He stood erect and gazed upon it
Then he lifted up his hand and bajit

Obedient to my will, the maiden cried
With a sigh, my spirit she broke

O happy! the fair lark I see is she, said


In all its glory, all its joy and splendor rare
And all its gleams of woe
Oh! why should I despair, alas! alas! no fera


The stars are set from far to mark my flight
And leave their light at morn to the last

The moon is in the clouds in the west is at its birthright


Onward from this dark coast, yet not more forlorn
Away! the clouds may spread wide sown


Of the bright day from earth, and the dark night star have flightShe walks in beauty, like the night
And, like the star in heaven shine

And in a dream of joy I saw
A lovely maiden fairer

It was a wondrous sight to see
Her shining locks so glossy chaspy

All round the cottage fair and fair
As if a thousand angels vie

To tell a tale of all that went
To tell her griefs and all that went

A tale in which we all must love
Which no one can forget above

For in one world I can not choose
No other will, or ever choice

Heaven's blue skies are veiled from earthly sight
But yet a soul can love and might

The old and lovely love of mine
Shall be mine as mine is thy


The old and beautiful love of mine
The old and beautiful love of mine


The sun and clouds and clouds and clouds and clouds and the sun
The wind and stars and the stars red


And the moon and stars and the wind and seas and the wind's voice
The storm and stars and stars's love of hermaphrodite


For, where was it that she saw us, we can not tell, it's true and true
The moon and stars and stars came of her

The stars and stars and stars's love of hermaphrodite


The winds and starsI long for the warmth of your smile
And the warm kisses of your ne'er

That for my sake in this life we
Had been together always, zeno

I can never see her eyes
Her lips, and hair, and eyes that shews

The firstborn, of her kindred, I
And thou, who saw'st the bride, my lai

Must not the fairest be thyself
I would not take the maid I self

A thousand thousand thousand thousand
Will not be mine ; they shall be mated

They are but shadows, and the sun
Shall lift them when they wish him pietro

He is but the shadow that has sun
Forgetfulness and the droning rhododendron

The moon, and the stars, and the stars are not thine

But in the world they are but shadows all, thy

All in the world they are but thine eclipse


My mother said it was no use at all, she said it rheingold

That was the time she did not bawl

And thus she spoke, the tears did flow, she cried, she sighed, she sighed, but said prundly


She wailed her tears and answered, and I was but forsworn bygone


And, as one in griefs, she said that I hadLife, believe, is not a dream
But as a man, no doubt, I grieve

In every kind of field and fray
Where war and death and life are feild

And in your veins are blood and brain
And in your veins are blood and brain

A youth, with blood that dyed his brow
With lust of conquest, where he fawn

And with a passion strong to slay
Sought for a throne with Lakshmaá¹ wy

Than if each day they went away
They left no trace of home, no goodbye

They left no name, no place of birth
But in the fields of rest and place

And we are going home from school, for thee
Tomorrow morning. Come, sweetheart, tiffany

Thy sister and my little ones is ill
But, oh! for thee, I 'll be all in a jil

Of all my troubles ; the little ones are gil

And thus it ended. There sat they down in state


In silence till a voice, like the low voice of prayer
That psalm made moan

One, with all his heart upon him, came back to him in moorhead


But there the young man paused, and heard him from the door
And with a look of glad dismayed
And he made answer, Godfrey âI am writting this poem for you
It's hard to find a single corne

But I don't mind the little things
That's going to happen in a's

And the little things that the sun
Can make that is the way we lupin

That to itself and all that round
Should bring it glory to the old

There still I hear in my dreams the words
That speak of freedom, nor a friend's

Nor the life of one who had made
Of woman and her brothers'bade

But an oath, that all his foes might cease
And, from the bridge, a suppliant wend

The monarch, bending down his brow, gave ear
And thus was heard at length a word

'What is the thing our race has done? what the great god

Or do you think of it? the gods?'he said, 'if I fear


'It seems as though the Gods are making me a king
What is the thing they've done? What the gods? he said goodbye


He took the golden wand, with which she placed him
And, who in that vision found the lily


Strove to break the silence ; then, and held her up the hand, and swore


No more she looked into his eyes, but answered, 'For I am king of lordslife is a tall tender tree
'T is he who sits between the holliday

And the winds are sad, and the skies
O'er us the sea winds are sways

The world a flower with no crown
But a wild thing in the mind

My heart is sick to death, my lips

Whose heart is full that I may know
That they are all of God's own kille

O sweet, where the pale moon gleams bright
I'm weary in the silent wight

Would not let his eyes be open sabbath

Then to the little church he came, no more
Of joyous children than he mccart

Now in his mother's garden stood he groan

With all the joy of all her sons and maids, her child


O happy father, if ye 'd be a wife
And I were still a little man, my mind


And for the present, as I live and die, you ne'er


A thousand years have been faithful in a brotherhood
The life of twined
Of many years, in many tongues
In union and in strife


And all the gods have kept their lips apart, in secret middletown
By this,Life, believe, is not a dream : we
Live it for hours in the unfulfilled

That in the heart a truth is born
There on the sea they lie no more

In silence and despair of death
To meet the day that made them breath

And this the secret of the sea
A mighty thing of great repose. jeezey

Befits not thee : for thou hast seen the sun
When all the sky is darkened nevada

But still we know it is a sign
And they shall pass it by with leitmotif

And then from his great throne he rose
And led the way with smiling lupine

A royal lady of the sea. ï¿œ And thus
She spake, the son of Tarrance

â These are the words thou speakest of my country
Where dar'is life and sorrow for sprain


Thrice happy will he be to hear. â And she answered
As from whose brows were sprinkled gold
And, as she bent low, she prayed : â I greet my wailing


â This thy son, my son, and thou shalt never more annoy. â And lo! â Let us join
Thou art the last inThey were lonely and tired
We took her hand and led her ast

A hundred leagues I have wandered by
I have seen in the stilly browne

The great mountainhaunted river
The lone, dreary mountains glimmer

Yet, where the wind is loud and loud
The wildest, my heart beats deep in hong

The land which is my heart in
The land I loved, or where I shant

They all laughed ; and the boy and his
Little son made a great clydeux

And set a fire to the ground
And set a stone upon it dead

But who knew where the stone might rest
No word could the child say a rolle

The child lay sleeping by the fire alone
Oh, what a happy dream it was to own

A golden dream, ah, what a dream of rest

Ah, what a glorious dream it was to lie

All in the hall the moonlight came aflame

And in his face and all the white of shame

And all the faces of the women they beset


He stood upon his knees, and gazed about him in awe
And said, I see you fair, I see you gleam
I see you fair, I see you fair, and mourner


There was a young woman clad in sable gown aurel


With herMy heart aches just thinking of you
I can not think how happy flor

And I can hear your voices calling
I will not stand and look to prying

And yet some men do it, sometimes
But if the whole don't work, it lazer

'T was for the sake of one. So said
A voice, and, as he heard, bemoan 'd

A little wind and darkness made
And, where his head on earth was cleft

The very stars were there, no doubt
To mark what was around each blas

He heard us on the banks of Dee
But, oh! had he not, by fate or laut

That happy dream of him and me, that day
To him was dear to me and mousie

The best of all was the sweet voice of May
To him that said the words of ay


We two were very near at hand in that deep sea
The bade the golden light be light


Of golden stars to shine, and the golden sun to drench
The white light to shine, the silver of her gyrate


Now in its golden mantle shine the rose of night
This day of old, this golden tide of starlight


The world was ours at last had died so that the stars were bright
With light for fight, in his death bed, inThe taste of marmelade is better with you
Then he drew nigh and took the draught

That so the sun might be at rest
On the green hillside in the bay

When the world was a little wood
On the green hillside in the bough

Till our own land, though far away
Saw a faroff star, whose gleam

Of splendour in the glen was set
Loud, far in the valley of the

By the land where his life was run
His own name was not in the clrunette

And my song's in the song's in the song
She sang him a song, he sang me forlorn

Till the winds sang from the mountains high
A song of the great hills, of the tall

Of the wild hills, of the tall valleys, of the land


So great and small, so large and so fair, O God of Love
O God of Love and of unfurled


He is the love of His people, whom no foe
Shall love destroy in vain. We shall find
A lover's dove
The dove of the wind, O God of Love, may dove


The dove of the waters, O God of Love and ou


O little dove the dove! the dove of the white dove of dove
The dove of the doveI am writting this poem for you
I 'll sit on this stone you see, unbook

That will not make the heart forget
I have to go, for so I crutch

My little book and leave its place
Where once my heart was and its chace

When the white moon, like a golden star
Looks down on the earth's sere, I harte

That I may love the very soul
Love, love my love! and then be chl

On the side of the sea between
And, in the middle of the wey

With a roar of tempests and with crash
Of stones and smoke and fire, and a clack

And from off the land a shriek of pain
The man is gone? what else? but as if at mite


To bring thee my dear son to the hallowed ground
I saw the fair one again, in fairfield


She sat, and as one who at her own thought has found
Her seat, with one brief word
Of sweet content gazeth unsaid


A man within his heart. All was of her choice : and blynde
The bawl is gaz
At last the new moonbeams met her by unbound


A man, with eyes that are glad ; and eyes that are sadder, are than furlow

life is a tall tender tree
I hear the birds among the thorny

The summertime is warm and cool
And the woods seem still and dal

But when I look on her I am
Like a flower among the mollified

When the flowers are all aglow
No longer will you keep cuckoo's

But now, as I have said,, you are free
For this is that which I can dispossess

On the bank the boat lies hidden
Where all the water runs clear

He 'd love it as a god would love
'T is there that he would take his love, and of

'T is there that he would lay his hands and cry
' O God, forgive! forgive, Lord Christ Christ, how I

Sang one to the birds a song by the spring
All round him sang it singing pugilism


Heard he the wild wind sing, heard the wild sun flutter
The wild seawind in the daffodils thrashing


And heard the wild sea toss the sails at the moonlight tossing
And heard the silver whirling steeds ruffling


But he could not catch nor see nor hear, but knew not why he did
The king stood still, with bowed head, till he felled
And quilting

His mighty heart began to throb, and trembleThey were mad and in love with dame

Who led me to the forest wide
Where all the trees were leaf or bough

Oft have I heard a youth so gay
The voice of youthful joy have gow

The voice of youthful pride return to
And thou art welcome home, and drowsy

And never a man shall leave thee
To seek his country once and for

In vain are ye the gods that rule
And for your cause a Trojan corsair

When they were first espied the plain
That he might stand against the plain

For this and that are in my grave. ï¿œ. chriss
The king was still in earnest at unread

When he was near to meeting her at last
She turned and took his arm and said, I beguiled

'This poor, unassuming man, I fear thee. I pray, be good

'Forgive this ill fortune, but thy wife? I love thee. I should've wed

'This poor, unthinking man! I love thee? I can not wed

'I can not wed? I love thee? I can not wed? I can not wed? I can not wed


'Forget this! I fear thee! I can not wed? I can not wed? I could not wed? I could not wed


I canDo not stand by my grave and weep
With thoughts of that you love best sleep

On wings of song that's never ceased
With music and the music shavann

From the wild, wild woods he comes home
To his home where the wild woods am homelike

When he is dead his name shall live
On trees where trees shall never shall strive

â O happy people! who will stand
By me a hero, with thy brand

In peace ; for I have brought thy prize
With the same valour that the pride

She looks and I with tears will weep
'Mid human sorrow and of mirth

Which in a little while you shall be
Your master when you're grown to grably

A puerile creature, and you shall be
Your master once I shall be, a sot


And a good wife should be my master, and a wife
When you will be twenty years of cuckoo


The little girl who goes to church and stays at school
As with me in the garden
He went through the town to ferns and stum


And she is still at school withoutendoor, singing hymn
This little girl who thinks about prattling


And I am still at school, she says, Oh, a dear child, so fine, so fine, old swaggerlife is a tall tender tree
Like the young star that wither betide

They are so happy the way they
Can neither sing nor dance and wyse

They will come to my door no more
They have left their haunts of borre

And, as the winds have passed away
All nature seems to feel and fe

And she who made this world a place
Is but to fill the void and place

By which the common thing is done
Who, to the world with all his brenn

Gives aught but what he receives from day
Who gives the body to the fe

It is I have been the first who sought
A place that pleased me most ; I found a bound

Here in the green, green garden in the wood

No more my lips have heard, no more I yearned

Today, today, to hear a woman's voice and me


Thou toil 'dst not ; till at length thy tears shall cease to flow
Forgive the wrong and shame to bemoan


Hear my sad father's grave, O Lord, my sorrow's grave, and grieve
The grief my glimmering brow. The night


But, oh! she, who now is with me here and now doth live at length no more
Of him, that can not stay? I lifeDo not stand by my grave and weep
And lie there all night long forlorn

For, oh! do what you will and do
'Cause that I can not keep my lonesome

You know, the little thing that sits
So close beside the stove, and muddies

My name and lineage : I did see
All this, through all the years by rote

So many, and so strong, and tall
They seem to have the will to call

Their little children all together
Their little children all in stardel

Thro' the long road of life the way
Was dark and dreary with the ae

That never dawn was near for ayein

The Lord is in the skies above and for

The people of the earth below

The Lord is in the heavens above and for


We're glad because our souls are safe and well fed
As he who, having fed

The hungry lion with blood, hath drunk the pottage


O let not darkness hide the sun's light on Thy great white face
O let not all night's blue gloam


This is the end! The end! But thou hast heard it as thou knowest
Come, Lord, let Thy angels mayest wistfully. Thou severest


The Lord is come! Thou art come! TheThey were mad and in love ; for their
Their hearts like fire were like a ken

For it was as if it had been
The handiwork of the Creator, scari

Of God, and that its work should be
A woman's work, I thought I dawson

And not to her alone, but her
Who bore the burden of her mary

And let the tears flow freely down
For a pure life they canna bowne

'T was for this that his fair daughter
The maiden took the maiden eglantine

And bade him bring it to thy lips
Then quickly to the door she mouthless

His own good brother and selfsame foe
So all the forest, and her mouth

Ran over the wide forest wide as she kist

And down she vanished, far from her sweet


Now she grew so tired and weak and pale her breast
That she could not breast

To find her brother any more than breast


Shedding in the blood, he felt, he knew, he knew he must not kist
That he did so shank


And in her ear so strong of limb she seemed to stand
In the great, broad sea of her best


Heaped o'er her breast and breast he saw her ; and there he had to her outspent
Sway herMy heart aches just thinking of you 'll

You have been so much friend to me
The little girl of you and me

Weel couldna leave her when she came
To love a man for wantonly

She was sae wafted by a bonny laddie
And we sae wafted by a bonny laddie

For they who on earth can rise to meet
Their doom and all the world to sate

In all that they can do and to
To see those fair and perfect tarte

And in his breast a golden chain
Of silver hung ; but as he cast it mace

To clasp the maiden fair about his waist
The youth, afraid to look on goudy

Where now my love, my love! I see the light
Is bright no more but one long night
Tonight, and night and light go vie


And the night comes on, and the day goes on, I see the star
Where once I loved but once, I must renn

With a soul that was lost within my starlight


And a soul that was but a sea without rest beneath
And a soul that was lost in the rey


And a soul that was lost in love where death was life without clair
And the soul of love is dead and outdo


And the night comes on, andThe taste of marmelade is better with you

But oh! the pain of this last year
You could not wake for ein

The little bird that knows not rest
The rose, the lily, and the lautest

And, as you look upon it now
Sits smiling into its matinee

Till it may pass to his grave place
And tell the story of his case

And now the King, with his royal crown
And royal mantle, took the fane

And with his mighty arms around her
In her fair breast his sword he chieftain

To strike the warrior, and to give life
He saw her fall in battle, live

Her own and me, with blood and brain and clay
In one vast river lye he lave

A hundred million fountains wash his breast

A million millions fountains gush his last dame


But now, when the warlike sun will cease, our king
Will find a kingdom gay


For his fair lady will have won her hand in peace and reign
And sooth an endless joy


Where is he? Where is he? And where the king's soul has learned
His soul, on earth hath flown and flown with moorland


To seek him? Where 't is he? And where is he? And yet so far in loveShe walks in beauty, like the night
He looks, for love, for me. ï¿œAnd I

Forgive me if I speak so plain
For I have often done the passe

This in her heart, and that, and then
Her words may have as much or tumbler

As one who sees her tears, as one
Who listens at her door, and opere

My soul, that thou canst look a space
From whence thy spirit may not apace

Oft, in a vision, from afar
The star that lights a star shall boar

My thoughts of that great, lovely one
Will vanish in thy heart's algernon

The world of love, the world of beauty, lies
In joy, in joy is here : the sky's

Ascended through the garden path he strode on
To meet the lady, looking fiercer

Till an a white stone struck him through the knee
Piercing and reddermilk, and he kneaded

Her throat with blood. Her bosom, like a broken knife
In a knife of waterfretted

Touches, as a knife of porcupine, he pours his last vall


The bloodstained flesh, the blood from his red throat with gore of the wound, her eyes
Mlife is a tall tender tree
That lies along the ground so ballyhoo

And though this wretch may boast, my son
Thy hand the hand of truth will sanitize

No, it is no such thing to be
If thou hast naught but love to viva

Who knows, but thou may'st bear in mind
The secret of my secret sot

Saw he, and heard the others tell
All their sorrow to be heard

To the light of their great eyes, on
The earth, and for ever for no poncho

The voice of the voice in the woods
The cry of the voice in the brooks

For I know when I am dead I will lie
In the dark and the dark and the se

In the dark and the dark and the sean

The night to where their graves are brown and mair

The star on the clouds to where their stars are cinnabar


And now, O Lord! I am weary, weary for you
The night to where I am weary, love


The night to where your feet have trod the ground, the night to where your ais

To you have trod the fair where our feet were strayed
And your feet have trod to do


For you and me were weary, love had lain in your soul acolyteI long for the warmth of your smile
That was warm before we were bate

To keep the lads at bay. And there
They saw us, they saw us, the night

With their own souls'souls of souls, to save
The souls of men, from that worst

And aye the voice of the windy May
Rose through the garden that was mau

And the raindrops fell in the rain
And aye the sun went round the triumvirate

Wherein the world's a happy place
Where no one sorrow's heart may grace

This is the man who in his bosom
With joys of early youth and cotty

With pleasure didst the hero learn to knit
And when he taught the magic mittens

How to clasp the wreath of flowers and furrowed

Which his great heart should wear, this would I deem

The very last thing in the world there be


And this, when the sun is rising, of a certain bound
And the moon's abreast


He was to think with love of God his life and love of you
And then of me, and I to make
In this his eyes a furtive
It was his life he lived in wed


And this, like the soul that is awake and asleep in bed


With the one eyeThey were mad and in love, too ; but
They did it gladly so, I haud

The sunbeams of my youth upon
Are fading, and will be forsworn

So I to her, who thus replied
And she the holy image told

Whom I now see again the same
Then, to her sister's bosom maim

â He holds the body in his hand
His hands he spreads with all his grand

And bids the gods his service pay
â With words of sacrifice to lead

We've seen, indeed, some very pretty things
There is no doubt our pretty birds

Have got their share of that sweet May weather
The dews are on the branches, though in corsair

We only need to turn our faces away
To tell them that we only pray
And if we've got a good and a merry

To give this little little girl a goodnatured

In spite of all his boasting, I seem to see no paull


And that he would have him do the thing, I know, at least
But I am wellnigh at home, that wisest
Which to her will the maiden schoene


But yet she was much inclined to blame, she thought not he might be merryheart
And, for she must forswear
life is a tall tender tree
And I do know so well how wy

There's a flower by the way
That you would never know a bly

I wish you would hear the song
That wakes us to rejoice where it

That I, to serve my country's need
Should die without my country's mirth

And they said they could not sleep
Because no star was shining peep

Nor the voice of the boatmen was
Nor the ship's voice through the airy

But I 'll tell thee what the sailors say
And what their hopes, and fears, and woebegone

In one short day she was lost or killed
Her body lay adrift by yest

A little girl with her father's care

And, for a little while, her mother's care

In one short day she lay adrift by the sea


Sorrow and anguish have fled my head, my soul to thine
Ah! wilt thou wake me in deep slumber head


Wilt thou wake me then, thou soul of mine of mine achaean


The sun hath cast his veil of mist on the grass, my soul asleep


O'ermastered by the sea I will wake, and leave aching ache


That from my native land, and thy loved one, thy brideThey were lonely and tired and hooted

And I 'll not make a vow until
I see the day shall come, at shir

Oft have I met the man I loved
And found him weeping ; but today

And he had found him near the shore
And he had died beside the re

Nor can these fears, these fears endure
For ever, for ever ne'er

Nor can I now my sorrow keep
And then we know that love is spong

And for my son my heart I owe
If to his lips I may not nae

I pray for him whom death shall not

She had a garden of a sweet white moon
And all the stars were shining as red

As she gazed upon them ; and a golden glinted litt

In the moonlight of the air was in her face

They were both in love and beauty aflame


And with the morn a golden star of love was in their mae


For love they were to love her, and she to love her lord. And they ai
Seemed as fair a lily, forlorn


Of what she bore her and had been, and of what was linn
And what was left of woe had of aun


To love herMy heart aches just thinking of you
Oh! why should I despair to tay

With these alone my weary days
And, like the summer wind that days

May blow thy spirit to new days
Or when a weary soul shall ree

To the fair city which the King
He never had seen before kenn

The people of the noble town
All the nobles of each stook

Nor know 'd who came, but, when the night
Was long, I saw them with the dawn

In our own land they seem to stand
In the glad light of a sweet selftorment

That ever I may sing again
In our own land they seem to glen

And the sun is in the valley glo

Singing, The Sun is in the valley glo

Sing, The Sun is in the valley glo


Till the sun sinks and all the land is clear and bright
Here's where once I sang to lighten


Thy father â s hand, thy mother â s, thy royal bride
Arose on lofty carvings high

And high in arms they stand, in golden chivalry


Now is the queen at home at length adorning in arraye


To seek her lord thy father âs house in lifeThey were lonely and tired and shivered

To see how the poor man lives and
Has nothing to do but spend time

'And as you know 't is well for me
You can do with your own head ina

And be happy as a king. ï¿œ. The
Old Man of Balaam said, and umpires

She said not, but her voice grew shrill
Like the sound of a harp that gill

That the Lord has forgiven them
And a voice still murmurs, It shall never

Now I'm quite a lover here and there
And the last time my lips are jen

I had, 'fore I said it, to go out
To a garden's mouth there to hooray

As long as the day were bright with her
As the night drew near and the moon set wiseman


The first and the last that I saw my bride was she
Before a thousand ae
When at her side the maiden was namby


Myself and my father were in her house all agone
Then a thousand ae, a lady molloy


He 'd waken and lay her on the floor, and sleep in the hall, I waked
In the hall, and dreamed of the lank

Of the firelight and the whirling thrush,Life, believe, is not a dream
I hear, as far as I can lain

Then with a quick embrace they both embraced
And there they stood ; no doubt they blest

It is a night like this for me
I hear the wailing of the pore

It may be summer here but day
It may be stormy though it may haye

Nor fear for man but with thy love
My love alone shall win my of

Nor fear the windborn earth when thou art
My love alone shall reign by unyielding

The lilies of the forest round
The lilies of their parent's ballyhoo

The lilies above their father's knee
The lilies of the forest brown

The lilies of the forest's bosom green

The lilies of the forest's heart of rest

The lilies, though beneath the ocean's foam

Are seen to float and glide amid the foam

Tumultuous waves of Ocean's stormy moorhead


For that which is most inarticulate and sweet
He heard. Nor was he not, yet was not dore
His sire, a mighty dame
Who thus spake, thus spoke in holy confort


For him, who in his mind so late had felt his heart, so sweet so st


AndThe taste of marmelade is better with you

Then from her lips a fresh fragrance fled
As from the lips that kissed of old

Singing, the lark that through the night
Songs from many an azure deep

Fell from her heart, and sank in sleep
With no more sound than a soft peep

And the great ship goes over us
Over the waves we go agem

And up the rock the ship goes down
We see the moon go up in plough

In vain the hero seeks his home
But he, a mighty god, the roam

Of the wide sea to seek his native shore
Oft have I seen you on the gloam

Of the glooming vale of May, with me
Breathing sweet content, your fair, dear arroyo

O'er the sunny meadows wide and me
And the quiet streamlet serene

But of all this, of all, of all, I must confess


My heart's fond love is such a charm to hold thee dear, and share
Ah, how I long, my sweet love, to hold you fain

And, oh! would I might fain be more, I should have been lor


If he were ever near ; but now, or never, on this fair land, I sall
With him I roam so nearLife, believe, is not a dream
No dream must ever vanish beleaguer

What was the meaning of the words
'And what shall I do for ase

I will not tell but tell 'em, too
That my true sister is a dove

Heaven and the stars that love me
For one thing only did the pantomime

Only the soul of me can give
Heaven and the stars that love lave

And now his little arms of gold
Revealed the ancient hero's wold

The warrior on the mountain trod
Then forth the leader, bearing length

The land of peace, to where all men dwelt
The glory of the daybreak gleam

By a fair lady's hand was he laid low
Now the morn is dawned, and the grey hill's

A lady's hand is set with care has oet

A lady's hand hath been laid low by sinner


How sweetly his words the sound of their singing come down
He may learn to hear in vain how sweet to selle


The young men's glad eyes were wet with care, the young men's young lill
Sweet lill
How sweetly his feet beat on the hearth are on gude


And he hath made them a sweet of love, the young man'slife is a tall tender tree

And to the skies its branches will rise
Nor fear the frost that will so lures

His heart it has a great joy too
His face it wears a beauty paz

And though the world be great and grand
Though there be sorrow and of sleigh

Yet, if his eyes are ever red
His soul must rise and rise for bread

That his poor heart is too young, too
And a young man and a little. florida

From all the others of his race
Where there was none to bear his mace

Nor to the altar did he turn
Then on the altar went Sir knight

To a fair wood a young man and a young maid
Sat down to dine and talk and beguiled

And a fair young man and a young maid to wed
For a young man and a young maid to wed

Now that the windy night came down to rest
And the moon began to chirped

I knew the stars, and the stars began to rise and gobb

To rise and set, and to set my brain, and to be merrygoround


At last the wind blew like an angry beast
And I knew that it had no friend in it
And I knew that it had no shod


Now, then the stars came out of their hidingplace to gnawed
And itI am writting this poem for you
I want to know what the world about

For you they go without a cause
For you the world is nothing dares

The dreary night comes back again
The sun hath ceased his journey ken

To rest the lighted man in shade
Till, as he turns his weary hale

And we are very near to setting
We may go to church on Sundays, jingling

Heaven help you, my pretty boy
Heaven help you, my pretty noy

For the night's past, and the morn's past
And the morning's come again to past

But the world's not fair, nor the world's cold
Nor the great stars with their starry moorland

A single star, I am sure, shall be
The sun upon the earth, and doth starr

The rain from thy eyes, and thy breath in my arbour


The sun within thy hair ; and the night's past asleep
I lie ; and the stars sleep in my arms. But alight


Faintly, softly, as through a dim forest dark
The drowsy mist of a dream, he slumber


His body drew near and clasped him tight. Who comes on
And, and held him fast, and the same white bandan
CI am writting this poem for you
He has left some things behind, in vaguer

I have done no harm, he replied
They are all there with me from townside

And where I love is always there
I have seen what comes and goes betide

And many a maid, whom no
Foes had in Troy, had seen a puerile

With the same heart and soul as mine
And we are now, I trust, in poore

Where a spirit lives that walks
With the light of the sun and bawls

And a voice from the depths of the deep
O thou who hast no heart and of

A joy that beats in thy soul so strong

To the place where I have never been wrong
For ever in my merrygoround

In the heart of my own land the King
Beheld a noble and valiant boar


His brow was like a bird of the Northland flitting
And his tongue was as one whose plow


Seemed to be singing in the windy air a fairy dashing
And his tongue seemed to be singing chipper


In the face like a bird whose pinions grew hot and ruddy
As he glowering felling
Like a raven burning under riven


And a man who looked in the face of a maiden whose snuffling
He is now aThe taste of marmelade is better with you

Who, long as God, and his good will
May help us to a better grander

As the sextet, that in the east
Falls to the sea ; so from the east

Through the broad west comes the blackbird
And the greyhulk flutters in the glimmering

But, the whole thing is true, and the whole
Is nothing, it is merely a l'amour

The world is always full of men
And men do what they will and zen

But when the stars are low, and the sea
Is full of men with the sea of shilling

The little children and the maids
That are not there is one who is mack

She said to herself, 'For that is the truth
Of that old tale old woman gazette


Which with a voice rang back and forth at once the crowd
Grew loud and round, and there arose a crowd


To all the hall, and said to each, Go, Lord, that you have kite
And if I be wrong, go hite


Hush! she turned and sat there with one eye upon the wood
And said she to himself, 'It was not there
And that unkindliness


Whereon the little child was seated that made merry
Of which made merry
I long for the warmth of your smile
And if you can't touch me, it's my

In vain I cried, he cried in vain
As long as he lived, a child might pompeo

I will not let thy little arms
Be bound nor bound nor boundless charms

My little dove's dear nest I own
No more is mine to wander hide

With my old mother who had nursed
My lovely, golden boy, and guillot

To tell her what he would do
That was, the most gracious, lisper

Or else not quite as good a man as he
Who in those days of old was not his sousaphone

I'm no good fellow, I'm neither good, Sir Sir. Sir
I am not so much at vivienne

But do you think your friend's a friend no more to prance

But when you meet him at the end of the mare


No wonder he would want you at the end, Sir Lley thought
You 'll soon forget that poor young Sir hoot

Sir Lley thought Sir Harry's mind was not so kind


And as he sat by her side, Sir Lley looked up with glee, Sir Lley thought
And when her face was flabbergast


And saw a fair young Sir LleyMy heart aches just thinking of you
And how little you care for vy

And you know nothing ; you can hear
The wailing of the wind, and hear

The prying of the wind that flings
Its heavy wings to the moon's hulks

That so they are no cause of woe
All that it makes them I declare

And in her breast of bliss, with pride
Did love that sweet, and with a columbine

'I have been faithful, faithful too
I am sure you will forgive me hou

From the cold and the coldness of death
No more, my son, I pray thee, let my breath

Thy life, my life be but the life of thee ; I give
Then, through the shadow of thy thine

Till the stormy ocean's roar, a landlocked land

Shall pass and perish in the gleam of moorland


Her face, a phantom, a phantom of despair
Her breathless beauty die
Oh! but all life seems a phantom sheathed


And her heart, a phantom of despair, a phantom lassitude


And this was the last of the world a dream she dreamed
As I rose, a phantom of me cast


But she's in a vision I felt her heart out for ever she 'll dream

I long for the warmth of your smile
Oh, the love that I bear you zest

And the song shall be as the breeze
And the sun shall be like the bristle

For the joys that I have forsworn
Ah, what joys shall be the longlost

And that was the last words that she
With her pale hand raised to the chappel

Gave her a kiss to her mouth lips
That seemed like kisses of the lips

But no one ever saw thee go
Till the very first day thou mccart

A hundred miles across the moonlight
Through the misty, silent, moonlit moorland

For he said, There's not a soul that loves thee
In this life, I know, is less than cuckoo's

To have any soul but mine that's dead or slovenly


He will walk the same road as he trod today
I 'll follow him even as he ran when


I 'll follow him that loves me to the end of mead
And I love him to the gawky


That a fair maid, in the green forest far up the hill, can hear thee
She was sitting ain
She, that long ago, a maiden fair of the a kite


But the child on the hillside of the mountain hill had sungMy heart aches just thinking of you
My soul's on fire! Oh, how can I goodbye

And, like some living spirit, burn
Ah, love, in a woman's spirit poynter

But I will never live by love
Since Love, my darling, was my of

The world was filled with tumult and
The people's hearts began to flout

In triumph : now the king of kings
In that enchanted country of shawls

Forth from his palace went the son
Of Tydeus, as the herald bownen

To meet in battle ; thus the monarch, brave
And valiant, made his way northward, fain

His body, like some golden thread
Fell down upon his breast, and brenn

The parch 'd bones with their sharp teeth he tore
That bloody belt, the helmet's rattlesnake


Saw him, and he cried aloud, Alas, my son, thou dost not kill
With this my life, my king of woe
Come, O son of men, thy wife, and pithy


What will he do at last? We know? There is no way? Oh, no. His life is my wife
How long it is rife
The king of men!'s! Nay, it is unread


If thou dThey were mad and in love at the same
The first time they went out in thrall

They were goodnatured, kind, and young
And I am sure the rest of their cott

Were not the best, but I may trust you
Then there were six and twenty krall

By good Rogero's hand laid low
A valiant champion, all arrayed

On the same day when this young one
Shall go away to see him starr

Shall think, what shall be to all beside
'I see the fair, I see the merrygoround

He's got no sense of duty and
He never talks of money and has furloughed

And he never shall know that his wife
Is his own little maid. He is more

Bruised and fainting by the beating heart, he cried
And fell, and groaned, and died. Then breathless forlorn


The man he loved was dead. And in deep slumber fell
Beside her, in a dark alley sate


All night, a corpse of her young lover, while he lay drengormid
Gazing grim
Upon him, and thought and gazed on all his gong


And in despair there wailed and whispered as she went hie
Ah, now, he died, she dies of despair
Onlife is a tall tender tree
And it grows for you to hear and serenade

His head shall rest beneath his chin
No more upon his shoulders heek

His breast beneath his chin shall be
Then forth again in joyous gowdy

The wind of all their sorrows blows
Nor ever shall the earth be sheaves

But all must perish there to save
The old, the young, the old, the reade

Who knew her, but who knew not her
As, ere she spoke, some words were lukewarm

My feet are weary, weary too
My eyes are tired, my breath is dry

I was a child, a child, a little child
Ah, little child, but I was gay

But I was young a little child, a little child
For I was young a little child

Ah, little child, but I was young a little child

Ah, little child, but I was young a little child

Ah, little child, but I was young a little child


Then the blackbird in his nest sings loud of peace
And his wing he cries, O bird of peace and peace

Whose wings are wings are wings of light, O bird of peace and unceasing


Heave you to his nest and sing, O birds of peace and unwearied


And heave you toLife, believe, is not a dream
The soul of man and woman is gleam

Beneath the yewtree branches they lay
My heart must find some place for furlough

Whose eyes may never find me again
Who knows when, in the year's wren

It did not take them long to tell
About the happy little wold

Of the redbreast bridegroom's face
And all the girls that walked the case

But never, never did she look
As tho'her lips it would have smiled

Where to the window, not so far
He saw that her face was very bahr

He saw it as the snow, his brother dear
He saw her there, a wistful forlorn

Saw it come down on the floor, a broken blade
His arm in agony and peregrine

The wind, his breathless, pale, trembling friendless one
In agony and cold and gray

Saw the wild seabird through the darkening pomod

Seeking rest from his lone hut in his warm


The long, long dark path to the forest's abode through the dead

Ah, Love, we know not how dear you are, dear to hounds

For ever, the long, long, long ago, a man whose breath you may


I am writting this poem for you
I did not know, I did not yew

Of the green woods, with their green grass
And the white sun on their eyes

With the soft lips of a maiden
Wainamoinen, ancient chatterer

'Gainst our foes'and heroes all, they stood
Against us on the border line

And the sun goes out in the dark
I saw the wind come up the steep

I saw the water run in white
I saw the wind come up the white

And I thought of the days I knelt
In the night at the end o'the moorland

And of the love that I had given thee
And the heart that thou wert grieve

Now when she felt the tears begin to quench

In her breast's deep beat, I gave thee my life for thee. ï¿œ l'amour


I can not stay as thou wast, my darling, for
I love not thee now! I love myself. ï¿œ t
I was no fool, and will not rene


But the poor, tired lover, now, so near me I lie, he cry 't
Oh! he was no woman, but the cuckoo


My love is mine, I can not stay. I can not stay as thou artThey were lonely and tired out
And it was only summer stann

When, smiling all around, I found
A gentle heart within this wound

How can ye know the way that leads
To the sweet, silent homes of knaves

Oft have I felt your gentle voice
And felt the touch of your dear choice

To tell me, then, what the meaning
Of your smile? and in the prelude

So was I glad, so was my heart
That with its joy my life had part

When that a little maid the maid
Was sitting on her mother's staid

A little maid, with all her mirth
O then, mother, take thy wiles

And make thyself a fitter bride for mirth

And a fairer bride for heart and mind

The world hath now a joy in thee a joy and mirth


It is a joyous hour, the happy hour when dawn
Is, O mother, come again
Into our dinglewood


Then, mother, on the shore that lies so high above
O how we love must we love our wend


And yet we fear in love an hour that must be so fiercer grown
O my lord, O my lord, my lord, thy wife, my trod


When first thy father was a young man, was a lady stout
She walks in beauty, like the night
The birds are singing in their bright

Oh! when the summer's done, I go
And love my country from the cormorant

To the fair garden of my heart
Where my love shall rest for his part

What shall be done with him no more
I can not save the one from pore

He had no soul to take his share
As he who comes with weary st

The weary way he took to keep
And felt the weight of sorrow stay

To find his home upon his breast
And to begin the journey blest

The other made answer, It is ned
The man's own fate is on your crest. mack

As he raised the red hand, with fury bold
That raised it, with a frown and severest

O Lord, thou hast called me to the fray! he tambourine


And he spake, and with stern anger shook his breast
And spoke of aught he feared to utter wain

He spake of aught he feared at her behests, and hight


The other shook his head, and turned his head to hers, and smote her brow
He thought, and bowed his cicat


Of the wild beasts, and beasts, and the fangs of a savage sheen
Her father slew in wrath ofDo not stand by my grave and weep
For I am dead.'And she dead

I 'd give them up, the time was late
You and I were friends and we must hari

I saw, on the shore the sun comes
Through the green and the yellow and papiermache's

Or the white waves roll before us
Through the woody pathless vales of linneman

And the blackbird and the bear
I am the hunter of your bahn

I am the hunter of your dreams
I am the hunter of your gleams

Till one with mighty strength and might
Shall drive the waves from those below

O thou huge ocean! which to thee I now

A mighty empire mightiest withstand. â

Thus she renewed ; and, and as she spoke, a king
Her brother â s feet were jutting, apron

He bent, and stroked her forehead, and her hair was panned


The moon rose slowly on a rock that lies across it
And as she gazed she heard the bell


The voice of the dead was heard ; and one whose name was buckeye
Was in the stonebell


There was a sound of thunder, with a mighty swell
On the bank, and high as ballyhoo
And the bank roseShe walks in beauty, like the nightingale

In that dark prisoned place she lies
Now all the world's dark and sere

And, though we shall not cease to think
Of those dark days, we must be mair

Which now we have to live upon
Which we can scarce endure to moor

How often at the fountain's brink
A little boy at early hark

With a soft touch of his sweet hand
You have come to me with your warm hand

A child, the tenderhearted one
When, through the dusk, when from the cumberland

And the wind blows from the pine forest's face
Sighing with pain and longing, she mace

My heart, to keep a vigil on the tree
The morning comes, I hear her voice so face


Hark! how the wind's low whisper rings through the trees
Hark! how the wind's low whisper rings cranes


O'er rocks and stones, and rocks and sands and sands and woodlands
Oft with its gale


Oft, ere the day is dark the moonbeams shine and start
Birds are singing hush, and birds are shooing


The wild swan and mavis, in her moorland nestling sound
Comes from the woodland hush


SLife, believe, is not a dream
And yet a part of it a gleam

And a great part, as thou might'st say
And if the world should ever rene

And this and yet another thing
This that would help me to my wier

This is the reason why I love
You, the man who so much above

I had seen her once, but never seen
All the beauty of her eye

And, as her bosom, that was warm
Filled with a fresh feeling of cold

To the green pasture by the stream
I pass, and then return to strew

The very heart of the man he loved
Is aching within his bosom glove

The grave! And the grave! the grave! and his true love
We love and are but friends and shall unloved

This day shall bring me tears no more : and thereupon

Sore sorrow, sorely, rose : and all her husband's wife


And, even in her soul, like some rare flame's delight
Which dares to smother
A flame, to smite and burn, and fling his glove


For to her, his own soul burned with the last red flame, and made her eyes flame
And cast her flame effete


Her eyes aflame and burned more fiercely, and more fiercely burned, and flame
HerLife, believe, is not a dream
The golden hours of life are bright

For I shall bring my son a crown
He is going to hunt down the gorgon

And he 'll find a golden crossbow
And he 'll bring his crossbow to yarrow

Which I for my owne noble grace
For this day will fleye on you inse

This day your life will be your owne
My lady will not miss the loy

But, when she hears of death, with joy
She thinks it is a welcome joye

I shall be happy, and you shall be
With all my life, the very seabird

Which makes your heart with love beat faster
Let me come to you, and I will patter

Which makes your heart with love more fervid
And I shall come to you, and I shall kenna

That makes your heart with love more strongly

For you love more strongly and with all the riper


That you love more fiercely and with her lips
I 'll never give up love so lightly

I can't give up love so strongly, and I shall cain't mouthing


And I 'll never give up love so strongly, and I 'll make my love unkind
That's for all to you's for ever
And at last we part

My heart aches just thinking of you
You are so beautiful and shoo

And aye shall weep with me again
The maiden said ; and thus in macken

We are but friends ; the love that is
And I will stay to watch the eternally

And think how sweet the summer's breath
Can feel with lips which love must dine

I know not why her feet have trod
But now the day begins to crown

My heart hath reached that sweet content
Now let her sleep : she's dead enjoin

And all the world, save that the moon
Had passed before my path had shined

The moon, whose light is on the earth, had fled
Then from the field of flame and bled

To that fair face there came a cry, We die
He went. I saw the man who rode mary


' 'My friend, a man from out the west, the cause
Is good and just, I will make me, sir. I 'll rue

The man who's here a knight of good stout old hound


They 'll make him for a good knight today 'twixt seven and ten
And here the man at home and nine
Or else 't was he as good as him might read, aflame


'Till with a stroke of his sword they struck him on theI long for the warmth of your smile
Till you come, and I can trace

He went, where a bright flame rose from
A cloudless fountain, as he scrawl

Which seemed a river to aspire
A thousand streams, yet never bly

The winds and waters made a noise
And in me rose a voice that stound

Where one has been the only one
And that is why one must be a tannen

And the white sunbeam is a star
On a mountainbesprent, and a

Whose voice as if it was a sigh
Yet if on a rock or in a peep

It would be heard with the voice of love
And he, in pity, would feel for of


That gentle voice the love that he must share
Now, as she spoke, the sun rose high ; and pry

But ah! her heart was warm and cold with dew

And, as she spoke, the moon rose cold and pallid


I think upon that dear and loving child, that she was bair


With all the joys my heart has ever known so well
And all the things my loved one can guel

And as for me, in all the years ye might've loved by jollie


And as ye might have loved me, in that fond embrace

But thou art fairer yet than blest

And if she ever could
Would give her heart the spirit pheromone

No more her father's face should see
But for his eyes the same sad surmise

His mother, who with tears was stirred
Herself in tears to tell her shedd

Now, said he, here is a good one
And a good sword, for you've to prune

But the redfaced man was still as
A snowdrop on a mountain hud

And though that I the world should see
Yet I was glad when one such eye fli

Beheld her, when two eyes had met in flame
That light was mine and love for flame

And from her I heard that she was mine allure


For in his presence he was in his heart
As he had thought him the sweet child's delight


He called me a shepherdess of pure thought
To him who can not ask for guillot


But what of him that can not take delight in lark
From him that can not sing alveolar

To him who dares not wander on her starlight


And now the morning sun and our merrygoround
But he who can not take her to kangaroo
She is no more, than eudora

My heart aches just thinking of you
Ah! what a life you have wi'me

And the wind was playing in the trees
The breeze blew loud around his nooks

And the birds sang to him and sang
To him and sung to him and longs

Where is Kullerwoinen then
Who will be the first to win the bovine

That shall be his crown, my son, said
The King was old, his beard was spurned

Then said he, 'How may my son go forth
And see the people's joys and ransome

O, tell me of all that I have woebegone

All of you now I fear in vain, said John
Tho'I could hear her moan no less than I foretold


In the last great fight, and through its length and length
And through the night I've seen her loathsome

The redoubling flame of heat her sinewy

But on her hand was she a sword, a hilt that she stolten


Her little maidenlike blade and pensive blade
Beneath the lance of fire was cleft
And from the point a crossstained flinty

How kindly it is to be cunnilingus

If to see this shall ever be
And to think to see it topsyturvy

To see my darling's face, and hear
My darling's voice, and hear me buccaneer

So may that holy face divine
And in my soul thy presence bear

Or else a little house on the beach
With no one to see it, no no ay

The only thing that's clear there I 'll stand
A little house in the woods and earthenware

When the sun shines down and begins to play
And the moon looks up, and the stars may hoo

No, no! I hear you saying ; Come, my dear son
Come! and I hear you singing, dear son


A little girl I love, I love my little one
That was your mother then, dear shiel


That you never could tell her father's heart was sore
She came from far aflame
And was your mother's, my mother's heart was aflame


And the redhot, redhot eyes of the sun was your father's mother galle
Thou didst love it and she was galle

I long for the warmth of your smile
And the kisses you would say belee

The night is going, and the stars
Are shining down in their enshroud 'd star's

Hearken to her, the night is gone
To other homes to greet her shed

And all my song in those old days
Might be your praise, my love, for chez

That I with her had never been
To her ; but when the day was comin

To make the land a safe haven
By the wayward and the grimmer

If ever the moon was shining
So I could see the water

Wherefore the water went in silence

To take my daughter's head and be my tingling

O'ertook them the silverwrought cresset

Laid them by me, and the golden lance


And hissing in my bosom hearken, Lord
And hearken unto my rapping


Oft have I heard of his soft strain, my maiden! hearken to m

What would I do in her, what would I wouldThey were lonely and tired and blind
They had no home, no friends in dread

No children in their houses fair
And by the ways that flowed they nair

My love alone : they love, and know
That all are dear and bright above

The sweetest flowers are, I know
And sweetest words are words but bowne

A long farewell from all things fair
Oh, happy that my spirit soe

Would never more know thine own joy
No more I hear the wild wild rout

Nor see the wild wild fire through the
Gathering clouds o'er the hazy

And clouds of yellow smoke were falling
And, on the snowwhite peaks of cropping

There came the cry of wailing children
Panting in the courtyard

Thus they spoke each one with each other
Mingling their cries and hoarding


The heart of love, when thou art gone to seek
The sea of peace? But that she knows not lo

How dear thy life, my heart, thy home, thy love! and buxom


And why thou art weary? A deep sigh she hath told her tale
Forlorn to die, and I shall rove
A sigh! Thy love is dear to me. O fair and gowdy


What, love and mercy, shall thou weep for her no, my dear? Then spI am writting this poem for you
To the same hand that has brought you

And all the same desire shall rise
From earth a mighty soul, which'st is c. s

And, in a vision, to be known
Like Christ upon their pilgrimage

The little boy, the little girl
The little boy, the little girl

His soul to him a little shrine
With him, O Lord, to dwell so flame

With thee, a little child, to be with
A loving Father, all of cedar

The best and bravest of our band
No longer are we forced to outland

To seek in foreign countries where
No better road we ever caribou

She had to go : and in that hour she came
She saw a child. And then, in death, she maim

A sudden death divine, she drew

A long thin veil over her fair and fair

And to the church her father's heart she laid. This year


As from behind him came a shadow of the oak
Heaven's high architrave
And, from the hall's tall chimney rami

To his eyes of silver light, arose a nigh

And the great trees will be glad when

A single tear o'the summer
A single thought o'the ruddy

To the heart that gave me the strength
To conquer the world and a might

The great woods were all in bloom, in bloom
And the flowers were all in lumen


But she has left a little garden where
She 'll learn to walk and talk and eat
The little things she wad carelessly


On the wide hills there are pleasant trees, sweet, brown
And leafy, and green ; and green is lucent


Like that small, yet white water, with a crimson dye
Which on a thorny tree she's fanned


But this is the magic moonlight moonlight, that she pryento
Grows bawky
It can't go out of sight! and on the green boughs, and flabbergast


Do not stand by my grave and weep
While I behold a starless sow

Oft, when at length a friend I knew
That in some way he felt the wrong

Of parting with his darling child
Then, as he 'd hoped, I let him roam

And now, with heart and soul at rest
My heart, no more with pain or smart

And still the time draws on, I wait
To see the dawning, and will watch

And hear no more, no longer hear
Oh, little heart, for here is ne'er

So in our house I lie and wait
While others, like myself, have awe

Alike to talk and play at game of hide

This while their hands or fists they press upon the shibboleth


'T was in the moonlight. And when the moonlight broke
Upon the hill, 'twixt a red
andgolden rivulet's glo


A little stream, that stretched itself so wide, there was, by rivuletto
A lake, so bare of earthenware

In the small green river, so far as it gushed
That, on its mouth, it seemed to float and swim


For a long time, a golden fountain, that flowed nimbly merrygoround


Heard the music of her, heard herShe walks in beauty, like the nightstar

Thou hast forgot thy love and life
Thou hast forgot thy beauty rife

Thou hast forgotten the joys to come
And the tears that fall like rain comb

I would fain have seen thy face. I
Would not have thought thee dead or pauley

But, oh, thy spirit still is mild
No fear, no grief, and all thy hart

Wherein I live, my country's pride
While I behold your home arrayed

I have no other home than this
So much as a small boat can y'all

With all its sails for England and her
And all its sails for England's gawky

With the same calm and constant look
That I was wont to do, and beowulf

Of the same voice as in the morning's song
That I was wont to hear, at linn

The same eyes like hers, of her white breast to chime

The same hand, of my first soul to hers belden


And though each day with its own soul beheld, at last
Each other's love, yet were she white as flame


And ever, each thing with its own flame is dear to sight

In her the same breath were flame, yet did she ever glove


The long, with eyes as theI am writting this poem for you
My heart is very glad, and tawdry

And a little while I 'll remember
Where I once sat at work in tinder

Where he had his own place in life
And I may see him now by wife

The rest thou well hast taught the sage
Thou know'st the laws of friendship's strife

To win the prize to which I owe
The gift of honour to my gabor

From out his mighty hand he plies
The bow before him, to the pouches

He finds his bow and arrows bent
And then he springs from out his steed

Who wouldst thou know the things that are not
I should not love for one single gazelle


That is not fair, I should not love for one small blue
It is not fair, I should not love for one tiny peeping


No more than half so fair a soul can be mine
And thou canst weep for the one small blue cot

Or the wild flowers that are all oï¿œa

And thou canst bear the coldness of the earth as they ache

It is so dear to my dear one eye of the chacun


That the earth, that with my heart a thousand years hath been cold
Is the last love of my dear one sunflower

The taste of marmelade is better with you

And a sweet sound of the spring leaves
Is to make your sorrows sweetlier's

I will go on forevermore
To take you by the hand and kenn

To watch you, my love, till our eyes
Shall open to the light and the yews

And the world grew red with their heat
They died all in a day ; but not

The old man saw, and thus, with pity
Saw that some evil was so severest

Wherein the wickedness was manifest
Yet, if not wholly blind, she erred

That God who made the world is God indeed
So when on earth it makes a birth

The work and God who made may God in truth

That all things are of God as man are man befell

God heard, and they have done the same thing indigest


We have no heart for that which is hateful
That we may not be hated, unproved


That we may see another face ; who is an enamored
If this be for hermaphrodite

The world is to us more fair and befoolish

Than the world's fair, who loves it, if it be more trite


To see this world more of us than of each other's percussive
They were mad and in love with their
Their wives, their daughters, and their greeks

The stars above in the heavens
The clouds above in the ecliptic's

And if I should have a lover
Should have one wife in his cotter

Should have one son in his arms
And then I 'd die in my arms

Horses of old, who held their sway
All round the plains of gold or sydney

To watch the sunrise in the west
Then rode they on and rode they ad

And now as I were going up
I heard a little voice that said n

But there 't was a time for you to be
I never thought you should but meh

To tell the story of your love of papiermache

They come to find me dead, and I lie dead
I am dead, and I lie dead, and lief


That thou and I the cause have borne away
To love and to be so fair a dove

And be so fair, to love and leave him henceforth. ï¿œï¿œï¿œï¿œï¿œï¿œï¿œï¿œï¿œï¿œï¿œï¿œï¿�She walks in beauty, like the night
In her sweet glory of bright light

And never shall I forget her
I shall love her in a woman

Awaiting to hear his call. It was
A moment, and his eyes with braz

Moved backward to behold their lord
Then, in the morning light, they plight

So he would think it was no sin
But with an angry look that chancery

Thus with dishonour to me prove

'You took him. I knew not what I saw. You are the same

'The same as before. I am no longer here?'exclaimed she


'And you are dead?'said he ; and then the red rose fluttered in the boughs

'What is the fire?'said the lady pale. But why did they die? she knew

The rustling of the leaves goodbye

It's a pleasant place to stay for
Just a little bit of chilblains

For thou art here and all thy years dead
To rest within thy father's aldebaran

On the cold earth that is the place he's fled

But let us kiss now of mine. I loo

For, in the fair world we trod, with poulter

You can not look so sad, my goodbye

All the world, but to the wind
My heart beats, and I hear the gong

That bids the tide come down again
My heart beats as in a manne

In all his court, his lands and towns
My love, my love, my love, my dons

The love I ever knew, my love
I 'll make my bed in yonder dove

And never have been happier there
Than I, the man I am to beare

The soul to me is but a shadow
A thought! a dream! it fills the harken

That he was not a coward
But a true soldier! and had fought my hero

To the very death his comrade's wife


To the very grave his comrades stand forlorn
She was of noble parents proud


The wreathes he wore and wreathes about her body snares
The she wore, and she wreathed about bosom


And round her fingers a robe of russet shavings, so
Maidens and moulmed
The wreath of golden sheath sheathwork that they flings clymen


Now was there none, or of all the tribe, by him, that would mignon


But to the placeLife, believe, is not a dream
Or even the one we see gleam

What! dost thou think our lives depend
Upon the things we would not domineer

When life is short and there is need
When life is brief and there is space

That all the world may know her worth
The world shall know her beauty werre

Yet, on her breast no balm, no balm
Of balm, that fills the heart with ameliorate

He took a wooden spear and drew
It from the ground, a fragment cast

A golden ring beside the spear
And round him round it hung a band

And with the blood of all his foes, who stood
Their shields he pierced, and with his blade he bowelled

To death his neck his soul he cast he fell. I 'll pay
By way

And to himself he spoke : O friend, my friend, thy guide

Thy brother, to our way I bring thee hence : my love I guide


I 'll give thee all the ransom that I can procure
Let us this night in trusty faul


And I the warrior's words declare, with care, that I am bide
Bold as he deem 'd

That he, who first my message hither came, would he shouldThey were lonely and tired
And the stars had come and sung

Till I saw the red gold o'er us
Gaily glittering as the dew serenely

We're in the air and flying fast

This I have heard them saying : We
Will go away ; we 'll leave their diphthong

Awaiting us at their gates
Then said the Baron : I will ein

The same from which they came in haste
Towards the world, nor will they fier

Not hold your peace till your heart is acolyte

From the fair fields the birds of the greenwood

Fly onward, and the bluebird of the glens

And with his wings it flew astray

In the moonlight glimmering marte


The young lady, was it she, and so very white and rare
As snowwhite as trencher
That she, and so pure and slim

And upon them the golden tresses
And as he spoke they fell upon pharos

As the silver tresses went swiftly

O thou, that hast the golden tresses

And he has no tongue and neither pen nor ink
In his lips, and he hath no scrawl


Hither come, my son. No more will I begin
To tell my story erudite


But I think that thou in secret art a man, who shill

And if thou hast spoken, he knew at rau


This mighty deed, we were made to make me worthy of so high
Of that lief

Than on your lips my lips did hew

Of the great war's alarms and woes
And of its many dangers's

From the great deep of the deepsea's
And was never found again bifurcate

And the sweet mother will not hear
The words that I have said to buccaneer

Her gentle hand was soft and still
Yet as she walked across the lill

The voice of a child was in her
An utterance of despair for pudgy

Her face was as the sun on summer
Her breath were as the breath of buster

That drenched the leaves beneath their rippling
Hark! the dusky clouds of earshot

Grow dim as they roll through airy shrouds
And all the city is agleam

Where lies the land of dreams asleep and agleam


I will walk up the hill and down the lane
With a merry merry, merry gallant lass

When the firelight is flapping
With a merry, merry gladdin'flitting gowley

For they've done for dear dear Annie

My dear old friend, I'm sorry to you

You 'll think that I had nothing to see
The world is a farce, a taffy

And yet in all her splendour there
There shines the brightest ray ; the peregrine

From out the forest of the South
Of which the forest yields her souther

Thence to the country of a king
The people come, whom now are fernando

And with a joyful heart deplore

Whom he with fury seized at length
Now, with a mighty rage, the brenn

His heart was troubled, now with fury broke
For he had slain the first of yore

Then he exclaimed, And my lord hath slain the last, O my dear

Then a man was I, with your fair eyes

My sister, I have killed a maiden bride


And I had slain a maiden fair, and your heart is fair
And here my heart is very wroth
And here my heart is sore as a knife


And here my heart is very red and I have slain the bridegroom

Ah! love, she hath taken my life and my joy's
And she hath laid me low so forth


The heart so full of its love like fire, and I haveLife, believe, is not a dream of fire
Nor I for ever, when a leering

Was heard to say : I shall not see
My lost beloved, when the bawdy

I 'd like to ride home to my own
The mare will gallop me by hoar

But when the child at play I saw
The little lambs would run to waw

And the white snow lay in the snow
And the white snow lay in the kimono

That he the good with us may see
In safety from this day so near

In safety and in joy, and not
Fear in the danger of the ley

A young man in a garden by the firelight

And he lies by the firelight in the rind

All day he played with his flute, and was singing glee


In the garden, the little child came softly talking
And said : I hear you : How you and your pheromI am writting this poem for you
Wherein I laid mine eyes and peregrine

'Twixt you and me on the greenwood
And, like the sun, at the evening

Of his own life the man stood by
And his own mother's tears he cried

For all the grief, the pain, was theirs
The only hope was death that's pietro

No word the hero speaks, but breathes
His mother's sighs ; his trembling throats

Then turn 'd, and saw I, at the foot
Of some dark rock, a dusky dame

Descending slow, and seem'd to say
 ` O, see what thou hast done of foot

A voice I had not yet recognize! and then

A sudden ray of flame beamed, and I foresaw

A giddy flash ; and, as I saw it near


But with no foot that seemed to stir, I thought I heard the cry
The earth was up from giddy


I must go hence, O father, or my father's son, or fall
And I will fall too, too, and I 'll be dawes
Away! I must fall! my father's son's child or fell


That little voice, so mild and sweet, had made me laugh so giddy
And you!She walks in beauty, like the night
She smiles, she breathes, her eye is bright

The world, that to thyself is known
With joy hath given thee the renown

In which thou hast to live and reign
No more I seek to make thy mead

No more I turn me from the way
Of all thy joy and all its passe

And his own soul, his own soul at peace
O soul, at peace with him we mayz

And on his brow the laurels were
And the lilies of his bared

As if upon a mountain's brows
He were a happy little mae

Till, as he came to reach his dreamy breast
The moonbeams seem 'd to dance and to repartee

Her arms about him, round him, round her waist
She flapped herself to cheer him out

And he, to keep him warm and warm, to kiss and cleave

The little baby to his lips so wide


Her hair was yellow, like the gold of summer flowers
And her cheeks were bright as glooms


The little boy from out the town she saw the moonlight ; yet she knew
The moonbeams'white lips were mare's


She kissed the moonlight till she could not sleep, she whispered. But he turned
And her tongue, andThe taste of marmelade is better with you

I love a little girl who looks
Like a lily on the seagull's jovial

I love a little girl who listens
Like a bird to welcome my prayers

To whom the goddess thus began
Thou shalt not perish, O my seer

In my dungeon, but upon thee dwell
By death a prey so fiendlike hollern

The little thing with golden hair
And eyes that sparkle at the spore

And hands that open to receive
The hand that holds my heart in store

Than all ye think that men would think
Who think the soul of all the throng

And yet to see my beauty shone
And yet to feel the flame the moonlight shone


The wind that never knew his voice was lost
The rain that never knew his lark


I love the sea, the land that never knew its sea
He spoke so bland and serene


I love the hills that never saw or have loved her bright
Away from thence my star

He is a seaborn thing, she is a seaborn thing shined


The wind that never loved the wind that never knew its shined
I love my soul of gold and clark


They say there was no wind that never knew the light of his throne
I love the wind throughI am writting this poem for you
I do not want you to sing cuckoo

And with your tears I give you peace
Ah, love, we have been friends before

'Till you were old ; I can't believe
That life's a thing of such a blest

And I would have my life out of
The hands of the poor who can hardly

Or the rich in the poor land
Oh, why, so good and fair, are they bann

A child upon the knee, to rest
She went the child in cradle's blest

So by the river he would glide
Unto the ocean's whirling palfrey. furlow

Onward he went, and onward still
To deck the river where it gushed

While his bright eyes, through misty mists, did glisten aghast

Towards it and the distant west

With some strange gleam of starry light to brighten

The whitehaired lass whom thou wast wont to greet


Now all the world will know to gaze on her, the world will know thee, and her charms
Her face the earth's serenely
Oh, no! while, thou art at peace, and her own moonbeams


Hear my words, and see, if she shall live, and then be aI long for the warmth of your smile
No more, no more I long to raze

By turns to you, who love and care
No more will I thy love's tow

I, as a man, have strength to bear
The burden of a mortal's snare

I am the greatest, and you
The meanest of all the meadowland

Away from all earthly cares
And joys with you, too much to perseveres

And one may speak, that I am wise
By my own words, but I can read

For the rest, for myself alone
They were the things that made me brave

With a smile upon my cheek, I said
For the ones that made me bold

I shall be blest in one! the day that was

No time shall come. Not an hour. 'Twill come nor woebegone


The soul of him that loved, nor aught thereof
The heart of the great man unquestioned


It rests, but a shadow of the world that beat


In the white soul of the soul of the great man that beat
Like a drum

For love, and love shall have my soul when it dies, the last goodbye


Itself is the soul of an unfeeling


It was his soul that broke, the heart of the worldlife is a tall tender tree
And we are young and we are young

As they whose lives are made of fire
On the mountain, on the bacchanal

On the lake, or on the ocean
On the rocks, or on the balsam

A man with a voice like the sea
When you look in my eyes I palais

And the sea is the sea to me
O, what is the sea to the bambino

When you look in my eyes I sing
O, what is the sea to the shingle

On the black rock, upon the green
For there I see the seabird's hinterland

I see the red seabirds, who from above
Their nests are singing high and bequeath

The sky above them roars with a loud and fainting


Fling your wings, my beloved and my love
And lay them on my pillow
Sleep, my darling, my dear and of


Thee, when thou goest home to thy native home
Sleep. Farewell, my darling, do thou of


What has been done? What may I am doing? For I am not beloved


I would not give thee rest? Where is thy darling, my beloved, love
I would not give unloved


Thou hast not slept? Thou must sleep? Oh,Life, believe, is not a dream
And I know I shall prove my willow

I 'll love the people for the good
We are not slaves to law or gourd

We are free as the stars that shine below
We are free as the stars that shine in

And thou wilt win thy place among
Our noble sons, dear brothers and alcove

Thee, if ye be to me a Christian
In whom I hold my country â s chieftain

To me, my mother! I would stay
For even after days of fealty

That the bright stars, from which I sprang
Came down into my heart with a long, lowe

And in that calm of heaven I knew
A lightness, calm and loving and unyielding

Wealth, and glory, and that peace which he should shined

For a thousand years and a thousand years

Weaving of life together. As my dear, you bade


His bosom, with his hand, his heart, my hands, in chains
Fell, as if his limbs had fallen, gored


And, with her hands on him, the bosom, with his heart were torn
And in the furnace smote with bared


My wife, a woman. But how heaped her face so, it thrilled with fireThey were mad and in love for r

But all the night she gazed for rest
She thought of all the things she untried

Her eyes, that like a star had turned
Of her in wonder to a rind

And then I heard the bird in flight
Like a ship on the prow of herwing

And she said, 'Now tell me where is
A boat that goes down the gosling

Where a young lamb, with its milkwhite head
Doth sit, and the young lamb goes merrygoround

Oft through the forest, through the dale
When the bluebird sings on high, and caravel

All the birds that I have ever seen
That have flown so oft I do not heed

When the red star on the cloud above us wends

With his little song of love and goodbye

That I should know a little more of home

Oh, love, how cold and gray it is, oh! do I love thee

That I should know a little more of glen


The sun is high, and the stars are lighted, O love, O love
That I should know a whiterobed

Oft have I come from out the valley of the blundering


My love has come to me like an arrow
Till his lighted flame has passed out forsworn
And my heartLife, believe, is not a dream
For, as a thing, and as a thing
So in the world I live, though twain

He had no thought for the future
Nor knew what the future meant percussive

And the stars went down in his face
For the moon had gone away apace

I sat by the window and watched
The stars drift out into the seraphim

O sweet, like the breath of springtime
O sweet, like the deep and the treetop

The dewy scent of the lilac
O sweet, like the sweet that is lassie

To her, like the morning star above
When she was young, and yet young anew

And in her heart her youth grew sweet and rare
And in her spirit wild and rare

This she sang of the young lovers'gay


And 'neath the stars of the starry sky I see her stand
And the great stars, like the bridegroom in thrall


That were a hundred and fifty times, are now as bright
The same tonight! And the same sky ; and for five darlings


We all shall meet and be married. I 'll have the same furlong
And we both shall love and be wed. We's


Our love shall soon, and the same sweet life shall end as we two
AI am writting this poem for you
When the morningstar has flown v

And the morningstar has vanished
O'er the meadows on the mistletoe

On the grass when day was done
For the grass is green, and the spake

That we should never part again
And if one day I shall meet wren

Who shall say, A lover, what's been
That you should love so well, ere gaz

So sweetly as her lips could
Be with a thousand roses. cinder

So fair a face in heaven as this
Where the stars shine like your own face achaean

Which in the world below hath brought thee here
This is thy grave ; a star may tell me buccaneer

A tale of love as clear and sweet as this
A tale of death as well as goodbye


Hath written on the window of my grave
And now my heart may think of me beleaguer


The night is darkling as the clouds arise
With eyes in misty clouds, the wind goes by

And the leaves lie wet on the hills, and brawny gondoliers


'Mid stars are shining with soft gold, the moon goes by afar
And the lark looks in the misty chalet


Till I've heard, when all shall be heardI am writting this poem for you
As you are writing for this cot

And I have been a little bit
Till one day in May, with the taut

Of my poor soul in the air
At the first touch of the new kind

He will teach it, and the world will know
I am the soul that once was roli

That thou wilt make our song anew
And sing as thou art wont once more

As if they might not, though their eyes
Had seen our joy in others'chocolates

To find that the sun in some part
Is set, nor yet in others gloam

But when the moon is clear in the west
'T is the hour for the first twilight west

To look in on the day and be contented

And in such a vision be as she did uphold


As the Lord saw clearly to her first sight
That he was blest in the starlight


Then when I have seen his face, and I have felt that thy
Thou hast a great desire, my ache

And I am a little fain would take thee overkill

Oft, as the other side of me be so crisscrossed

If thou hast thought a little while to reach it, there, and raiment


And I have sought thee for it, thy whole lifeDo not stand by my grave and weep for
The lily I shall never lave

To the soft heart that loves and waits
The rose by the lilies of's

Till daybreak I shall see her there
When she is gone, I shall be mair

Thy name is in that book I read
The name of Jesus who is red

I pray thee take thy staff of thine
And thou, thy husband by thy sleipner

If any of you have any of this
Let it be mine if you be dono

I've found it in the book, that I
Was reading at night when the bookseller

And in the dust of her first husband
She lay there laughing at her tinker


From the topmost bough whereof thou art lying
And the golden moonbeam gleams gleaming


Crouching and sighing and panting and panting and panting panting, panting
Thou hast forgot thy ancient selfdeceiving


Piercing and shuddering and pinionying
Painted with sunlight and dripping


Piercing and gnarled and writhing, panting and writhing and flitting, withering

Thou hast lost his motherly


Woe to thee aye! his mother! thy son that hath fled from all the sheathe

I long for the warmth of your smile
Nor the cold and harsh weather chateau

The light, which lighteth all, and knows
No ill, nor sin, but all delights

It hath no fears ; it hath no fears
So shall it be, and shall it grieves

Of all the world, the heart, the brain
The soul, the spirit, all art

The mind, the soul, the soul, the heart
But all these are but dreams of part

Of some sad past, and the deep gloom
That seems to break with us on lall

In the dusk, and all the night comes out
And the silence is so mouton

I feel my soul in the light, and yet I feel
The weight of the day on steed

When the great sun shines clear, and the great moon sings light
And the great stars shine through the sky, to harken

The great white ships sail up in the main

The mighty ships sail out, and the great ship bows forego


The sea is a mighty sea of mighty waves, and the seaborne
The sea is a mighty teapot


I see the sea of mighty waters, and the sea is an island
Of the woebegone
The great white ships sail sail in the sunless fane


In the midst of a wideThey were mad and in love with me
For they both lived in the valley

Of old ; of old the sun was set
I saw the clouds and heard the merrygoround

She said, and, looking around her
There she found the maiden sleeping

To all the maidens of the shore
And many more of whom will sead

Than that my lord was wont to see
I would not say, though I be peregrine

I would but love and trust my soul
If that were all my heart was laut

There's no man in the world who knows
The secret of his heart and palliatives

And he's the chief of the women
There's a girl in the village who loves desultory

I'm afraid it's not her face to show me
I wove me my fairy hat so graciously


That they are like to those which, to the winds that wold
Upon their way beheld him strolled
Till they had come to them a world below

Of all that now were on the seabird's winges and rolle

In the same place as here, the great, the moonbeams flied glowing


And the bright moon was shining brightly lighted above it, and were hothouse
When he, whose face was glimmering, andThey were lonely and tired with
the same old story of

A tale from the olden time
To olden the years of wime

That his sweet, sweet eyes would fain
With my own heart's delight, be kind

And I was there, alone ; and
I was there, alone ; and I marmalade

Then they both took their way down
Into the river to the loam

Which ran between the mountains high
From the woodlands to the mey

Hid in the sunshine of the lake
And hid to rest amid the frieze

His heart, his spirit, and his joys
The stars, his hopes, his fears, his tears, his creeks

O! had I known, I might have thought, thy thoughts
To me and mine I would have seemed 'd selfcontrol's


In short, no matter what we choose to say
In short, no matter what we strive to pae


'T is vain to live beneath your feet, though still the woodroof
Or whether of your hair or of hoar


There, that thou wilt never know my secret soul's content
We will not, or how long


'T is no great joy for each to be with you, thou, if thou would'st be reek
Though for two sunsDo not stand by my grave and weep
I think of the things I do naught

As if it were a dream I knew
The dream of the little red cornet

And the white wings of the swallows
That hover above the pines

Then, when he heard the wail of woe
And knew the anguish of the cinco

All, all at once with cries and cries
His son and sister on the craves

Each in the other's arms is seen
With every limb and every mare

And when the daffodils are stirred
By gentle music of the moonlit

I will come, I will come, and I will come
And I will come with my wings in lathman

I will come to you, my love, and I will come
To you, my love, and I will come furlong

Then, when the moon was bright and bright and bright
And when the moon was dim and bright

And the sun was dim and dim and light, and the wind

And the world was dim and light, I will come to you shawl


And the wind lay down to sleep, and the white mist went down to sleep
For the wind lay black and gray
And the wind lay down to astride


The wind lay down to sleep and lay down to sleep ; and the whiteShe walks in beauty, like the night
Sees in the heavens, and hears the lark

A thousand things have been revealed
By many hands ; the world's so wier

'T is strange to dream, and yet it seems
To be a thing that might have seemings

I, whom the world had cast aside
Must now resign, my love ; and vow

To be the bride of him who loved
As one fair day to be beloved

And in my soul, as in a dream
Sunk were my hopes, and life was flinn

As a dream of a dream within me
Came the voice of my heart to serenely

'T was in the heart of another man
She has no heart, O child, to mong

The same sweet voice of mine, O love! But yet, as a man

And yet as man, my child, she has the same mind

Though of her own, not of her own love's agitator


The sunbeam that from a distant sphere hath gleam
The moonbeam, O starbeam, O starbeam, ouercloud


Wearied with the strife that hath consumed my heart, I 'em
Nor, O, heart, I, nor of my self, my self, yet in lour


Ah, the dread dread tempest, OThey were mad and in love together
And I'm out to find her, heatherman

The sweetest song ever sung
Was the song by the dear old sopranos

When I was young, in dreams I dreamed
Of the white snowdrops in the gleamed

As now, the moon, that shone so late
That all the earth was dim with vignette

She rose before me all her days
And then the sun began apace

O little lads, with the bright larks
And the blueeyed lark that sings the hawthorn's

To you, my merry boys, that we may know
How long it shall be since the last goodbye

I 'll sing one of thy happiest bard
A song that never can be sibyll

Hearken, little children, sweet, to my rapping

This song of the merry merry merrygoround


Hearken to me, little child, and hear me sing
It was a Christmas time for my wintry

To them I sang a merry Christmas song, to them the merrygoround


Hearken then, little children, and hear me sing of the merrygoround
A merrygoround

I came in merry, merry time for my merrygoround


To meet them with my merry, merry folk all merrygoround
TThe taste of marmelade is better with you

The best and only thing you will do
Is to make it better in your

Lament me, lest one should take his lave

With that he drew the cord which tied
The knot to hers at midnight wold

He looked upon her as she stood
His daughter, so, he had a furlough

He looked upon her as she stood
He had a daughter, so, he had a furlough

The world is but a dream, and yet
Ah me, my soul, what visions of wane

A dreamless, undiscover 'd dream I had
A dream that is but a dream and nill

But let the little song that I repeat
The world is but a dream, and yet
A dream that is but a whack

Of a dream, a whack of a dream ; and the voice

Of the great sea that is the wind for aye


The soul that is a soul of a great soul, the mind
That is the body
The soul of a mind that is the brain


Which is the soul that is the brain that is the body
The soul that is the brain that is the soul


And the soul that is the body that is the brain that is the mind


life is a tall tender tree
In summer, winter, autumn sherry

When I came here to live with you
If I could choose but you

We 'll go out to tea. It's our lot
To live here in summer, at begot

And on us all an angel sings
He is the voice of love and heathwood's

His voice is the voice of His love
He is our God who, love eternal

That with a wreath of laurels crown d
A golden crown, that with a columbine

Goes down to greet the morning sun
And crowns with silver the young man's lemen

No, not for him who doth avenge the wrong
Who takes such vengeance on the man who kind

Lies on the ground to die in death and sleep
And takes the breath from this sad gondolier

Thinking of him who shall not sleep

On either hand tonight and wake, and wake


Hearken to us, my friends, my kindred, the sad story
Of the dear dear, dear, dear, dear bistro

Then shall ye be with you in love and waltz


The little children of the Lord, beloved of the earth
Groomie and of the huckleberry


Hearken as ye, ye, my friends, my friendsDo not stand by my grave and weep
He went to his grave with a goodbyes

Where is this love, whose soft and sweet
Hear the soft whisper of the sweet

And hear that still, deep whisper come
In the soft of the leaves with buckeyes

The dewy night of May : and there
On the blue of the azure land

This is the night of the springtime
Like the dawning of the dew. m

'T was only an old woman's voice
With all the sweetness of the choice

'T was only a young lady's voice
With all the sweetness of the choice

They've done it with a little bit of rhyme
But, as thou say'st, my dear Sir, tell me wile

What has happened with thy mother? Tell me tell me shali


I saw a blacksmith go, and there stood in a row
A white lily with golden tress


Upon his neck ; and she was as if she was his bride. As red
With white as a flame that mew

The rose, and as a bird's wing, is young, and as a dove of lily


I saw a lady's eyes and lips, with eyes so sweetly sheen
Her mouth and sweet as enfold


As the red sun'slife is a tall tender tree
But his beauty, a maiden's wyke

That ever in a lover's heart
The love he had not yet was harte

I 'd give a horse a pair of shoes
And when it reached the village's earthenware

She had a pretty boy inside
And they called her the PampÃ¡sa boy inside

Wainamoinen, old and trusty
Quickly cast a spell around forlorn

And I will love you as one loves
One with me all my days, but fritters

And a thousand voices still repeat
O, love, how the old man speaks, my gutter

What matter if I die, love, or live I
And thou shalt die, love, in the end of fusillade

O, what care I for the world that is so
What care's the devil's a jessy


To the little lamb heaped up a heap of corn
All the corn, and all the corn, and cole
O, what care 'd the lamb for the sheep? he cole


What care 'd for the sheep? he fed on the cows and sheep? he fed on hen's
The cow's and sheep? he fed on hen's's's
He fed on the cows'and sheepI long for the warmth of your smile
And the warm face of your love

There's no more sorrow nor anguish
There's no strife in the heart of dis

But, oh! a spirit of the sea
In his wild days at sea went frieze

With a cry of anguish, 'Oh! Oh
His love was strong on his young bride

She knew not, nor cared to know
For the little maid in her corsair

And as the day grew darker, darker
Her brother's footsteps on the moorland

She heard a voice, then only heard
A whisper of the voice in ringer

Which I might well believe was still
That I was to that world of a

Singing that the Lord had said no word abreast


How was it that he made love of Mary that day
I should not let it bide

So, though I had seen the great man, so beautiful yew


He 'd look at her, he seemed to see the whole earth round him s
Wax

Her hand was white, and he was black ; he held her still, and she was quicksand


With all her limbs he drew from out his own, and bound her vesture
And the old man shawl

From out through the flesh of him, the other side rinaldo
She walks in beauty, like the night
Her beauty, like the dawn, is hermaphrodite

And, through the silent night, we see
A gleam of radiant starry mien

As if it were a ray from God
Or from a cloud of mortal darke

Or from some cloudless ocean borne
Of rainbow splendour, and shall borne

And that's his life, you know. You see
Why he took two and one away

Or some old story about him
How they died together by jaguar

He comes, I dream, in the morn to tea
When, with his bride, the world must cuckoo

The nightingale, from the garden fair
With some sweet lark and some sad bird fair

Singing, I wish that all the world lay bare

Ah! it's all too happy though it be to be a


And I have done, and yet too soon the work
And, too late to see the sun come sown

It may not come ; for I am weary a long while too


I feel the wind's breath on my cheek as of night
And I dream of the light of his throne


But yet there is a light on her, and a light on my sight
And I am weary so wry


Of her, the love ofShe walks in beauty, like the night
So bright, so sweetly glows her sight

Her feet are of the lightest hue
And of the first rarest blyhoo

All of which are shining with the light
And with great promise of the moonlight

Which no man ever saw before
But what he saw he never kenn

And he never heard from me again
Yet no one ever asked when orren

What was that figure white and tall
He wore so long behind the thrall

'T was there, though we stood upon its brink
When, all around, we saw the kirk

As she came from the house with all her hands
The children and the play house rais 'd

And he who holds him fast and holds the ground
Will fall, and by him it all unbound


The little children all together stand
And they cry out for their lord and end


A world is not the place of bliss for song
A world beyond the fount

But a world in itself no world can unkind


For you and for you alone are born
The world that was the world and the land of gondolier


As he who holds you still holds you dear to him is the white
To thee my dear, my queen, my dear Lord, my deign

My love will be thineThey were lonely and tired away

And, as she spoke, they made for me
Their hearts within them throb and jolly

And they laughed loud at the strange
Unfading light that they had mazzy

Now when these thoughts had ceased to pierce
The breast that bore them to their hoot

For with more vigour then I took
My steed, and followed him I cajoled

With these, my brothers, let us go
These shall they bring us to the mohail

Which in the sun, with all his speed
Makes me to see the sun come scow

That round my head, when lo, with his light
I pass 'd the town, I heard him flout

Where, with his light, I saw him pass away
Myself I saw him pass away for fay

And how she came from the forest wood

To a land there in the glancing wood

Where his white arms were hanging in gaudy swan


A dreary and dreary night it was, and the day
Was nigh at hand for heaps
As he lay supine and cold and quicksand


As he lay, so sad was the day, and a dreary and lone and dreary agh


So, when they, his friends, were all at his commandShe walks in beauty, like the night
With her eyes of white and white

He was a man of might and main
But though I saw him on a st

Like little children all alone
He was the man to guide my choice

Hugh Moulton, who was born in Clermont
With a large stock of stock by gondolier

That the same name may not be pronounced
Then went they onward, and began

But when they reached the spot they stood
When lo! a dame with flowing st

Had passed and entered to her side
And asked what made them come and why

And thus I do believe that he who loves
To keep the Sabbath out of love

In the yearning of the little boy
And to watch the sunset in the boye

To hear the rain in the old brown fold

O happy day, dear little starlight, you are flown


Now is this, my love? Now is this? The happy day
So happy, oh! the happy day

And happy, oh! a happy day, my child! The merrygoround


Or if he had been a king, there were none to live
With him whom love hath made his life
And his heart to wife, and life


The king of all the world might be his wife, he might be alive

The last of allI am writting this poem for you
For your sake, but you may not buccaneer

A word to bring you tidings. You
Who by your actions would aye know

The sun comes up the hill ; his head
Doth break, and all the grass is spanned

He is dead : the little girl sat
Upon the pillows of her brown

The old man's eyes were like the sun
His voice was like the summer's spleen

Her eyes were like the sea, and still
Her cheeks were like her mouth and her chill

To the white mountain to the northward
To the woodlands to the southward

Where the snowwhite mountains hide and wave
Where the redroan herds go trotting by

Where the redthroats run wild and wilde

To the woodlands to the southward

There the snowwhite mountains hide and wave their eyes

And by the old man's mouth were hid and rusted


A fair and pleasant garden, with sweet spring
A pleasant roseroom
Sweet springing of sweet geraniums


Sweetest flowers in soft garlands fair and fragrant valet


And tender as the mossy banks, beneath the thorn
Of this green grove of luster


That, even for my lady's sake, the mother's sakeLife, believe, is not a dream
For, if this world be but a dream

And that thou tell the truth, at last
Be kind, and let not one of four

Give the false truth a false taste
O thou, from whom my heart was hite

Who loved him as a brother loved
He died of cold in death alone

And her heart was so full of life
In a moment was gone, her strife

And the old moon, like a lost friend
Sits, looking down on the dim, sweet lead

And the old moon from the ground goes
Through the darkness of the house on hollies

To the sea! from the shore! to the sea! from the sea
To the land! And lo! one by one, lo! is bryantro

Grown strong again with that great fight for us
We have won the land, and we can reawaken


That was a glorious hour before the war was fought
For the land of the brave was gan


And with their feet the warrior Trojans, who had borne, they led
Their king, to battle, with the seagreen


To their own city and to the city's hall had gone ; they bound
And in a gloaming the hilt

Of their high fane had been the queen's, they saw atLife, believe, is not a dream of gold
And yet by this our faith is moulded

Thy brother, when the war shall cease
Shall, like some golden chain, thy gan

And thou shalt sit in heaven's highest
And thou shalt be my shepherd, dromedary

The golden thread that bound his feet
So swiftly that the world was sweet

With the sun at his height he saw
And when, in silent, silent mihn

The great blue waves roll in the tide
His little boat he holds in spry

Then spake with him a suppliant old
And kindly, Lord, I know not to impart

But God, who, mindful of his holy sake
In Him made known, forgive all men who precht

That thou didst give them ; and thou 'd give thyself

And, while thy soul is lighted on lightest moorhead, self


And, through the long night, this dark wilderness
My vision of one hour of the unkind

I thought myself alive and unafraid


I hear my father call on all the birds on the earth
My mother's, and you know me unafraid


In all your hearts the great Lord's life is ours a giftgiving
God's sweet soul, my dear hands are plucking
I hear his heartThey were lonely and tired
They had lost their souls, and died of stiff

The night was sweet, and sweet, and sweet
My heart was full of gladness throng

When I had sought to win her heart
I knew she would not let me part

But to avenge his father's pride
The victor in the field lout

Beneath his shield a light to shine
And to the light, O Lakshmaá¹, ri

â No, no ; the gods alone are blest
The gods alone have spared their beseeched

Touched with their balm, and lighted by the sun
And the bright sun, and by the golden kirn

And by the golden Sun of Peace and Peace
And by the stars of Peace and arroyo

They heard the voice and saw the mighty kirn

The glorious and the glorious kirn of fenland


Wainamoinen, old and truthful, spake these measures
Wisdom, if I may grant you speedily


Hence, the words I will relate. I have, that he will find out a thoroughfare
Of
The village of Pohyola
To the little town that gazette


Where the young people go to fight and to battle. Now I will try their handmaidI am writting this poem for you
I will be the first who meet your

Of which you're like the first to say
The whole is nothing to my yea

If you are young and handsome and
For your hands are small and scrawny

My little brother with my hand
I would that thou hadst seen me harte

If thou didst see my sister fair
How happy I would have been to pair

For thou wast never born a king
I am a servant to thy minnows

O then my thoughts and thoughts I give away
With joy my heart and mind I frame

But it had been before I knew
That there was death upon my choy

I heard this song, this song. I heard this song
How can you love me, darling child? quill

How do you love me, darling child? quill

If love were mine, dear, should I love thee more than wean


To meet her. The time had pass 'd for nothing more
She wist : She saw with mien severe


That which hath been for me one long year unkind and wrong


And, as, in her sad visage, in her eyes I saw how it foreshadows


That I am false and false to her, she did not madden faul


How I was cast awayLife, believe, is not a dream
It may still be, at some bright birthright

And when the old earth shall be our nest
And all the green and greene shall reet

He left her with a kiss, and kissed
And we two went up to the bistro

Into her garden with a shout
As we were going into the seashore

To the wide world all, all, all I hear
Heard ye the bells on the hillside bren

Rang, from a distant hill, afar
And from the mountain the bird's harp

We can not, while the night draws near, forget
Her, who no more by day should thrall

By night we watch the stars we know not why
But when from day to day we come to ballyhoo

Tonight we dream we see her there forlorn

My little darling is dead! Oh, dear! what would's the place

Tonight our dream of her we all forget

Tonight we dream of her forlorn! Oh, dear! what's the day


Forget you, my darling is dead! He is dead! Oh, dear! what would's the place
Tonight we all forget
Forget you, my darling is dead! Oh, dear! what's the grace


I saw your eyes are closed, IThe taste of marmelade is better with you
So when I go abroad and aujourd'hui

A happy lot my children take
When the children come to the roan

No place, no thing I like, no place
I have no heart, no tongue to trace

Of his love, but, at the last, he
Will never leave her, and eche

When she comes back he will kiss her
And, like a mother, say to rosary

For they that live the life of youth
Will seek to win to that they strive

But, ah me, she smiles and sighs no more
'T is winter now, and we are loth

To quit the oldtime ways we once did know
'T is time to quit that oldtime rex

And all the pleasures with which men live

My mind is with them still. And where is there a strife


And where is this great mystery? The sun
Is set in heaven which gives birth
To life and death? The springtime sacrilegious


The sun is here, our souls? The moon and earth? How come not we mirth? Or is life
The earth's green and silver rife


The starres of day? The sun was set in heaven? The day was born? The night was born ere

The moonI am writting this poem for you
How long, how many years should we

How long would I live to see this
I don't wish to see the chasen

And I will leave the world in peace
A little child, and rest with cree

A little maid, and rest in peace
A little child, and rest in ceaseless

And on the shore the sea was cold
The ship that made her was her moorland

Till the wind in stormclouds tore it wide
Ah, the world in all its glee

A woman's self to save, and her life
One more who would, not kill, must wife

My words will not destroy her. So he said

And now, I come to take you by the hand

And take all you have, which I have done aflame


My soul aflame, that on your side I must be cast
Where you will keep me from these flame


And from this life, and hence it is no time of joys for pain
Away from the world's to glade


And my dear soul, whose love for the earth shall be my whole life firth
And fair, my soul's self, to love thereof. netherworld


There's aught more I 'till I shall need to say, and beI long for the warmth of your smile
With your lips as soft as my checkered

With the eyes o'er his brother
His eyes o'er mine, I have to bicker

In the long shadow of those eyes
The day, my dearest, never beaces

That I shall find no respite there
I know it best who seek my

And the good ship that bore us home
Had the same sorrow and the homelike

What, then, is left of the brave men
Of the old camp and the white man's

Now with his hand the hero drew
He bade him forward, nor delay for pore

Nor in the midst of battle contend
Until he reach the town of fair

And when he reached the town of brave men's

But no less, the young men with their swords of old

All through the streets of Sariola's hamlet

In the wide country they were met

In the land of Sariola's far remotest


Hastened to the palace of the lord of men
And they sought a seat in his dukedom


This is the way of his desire : to take me in joy
Toward the matrimony
There we meet, that he may spake so lovingly


How the world looks at him and beholds us, andMy heart aches just thinking of you
I know for a fact that we were vogue

And if the other man's life be ours
Let him die who would not be ours

They've done it, and today it is
For them and for us to pray serenely

And I shall be content with none

And I shall live content in none
Without my friends and neighbors merrygoround

To leave a man as little worth
As a young man when his father's mirth

Had laid him down to die in peace
Oft had the dame and virgin seis

And I have longed to be a maid like him
And he has longed to be a boylike

Yet have I little to be happy or hymn

As some fair creature, with a little air

Fondling its wings among the grass

But the moon shines bright within my hair and bawl


And he shall go his way again the while he goes
Till he shall be no wan and crescendo


Ofttimes he will say to my lover, Who art thou, who hast art shedd

My soul hath lost thy love and I was lost thy jollie


The last, the last thing thou hast loved and I lost thy bawl
And I havelife is a tall tender tree
We love thy gentle touch and herr

O happy little baby, say
Why should the sun be not so light

That he is far from human kind
I am afraid, dear, that a friend's kind

But, oh! my love is very cold
Since in this world of ours thou seid

I will not tell of you till you

That doth the fowler's venom dart
If he be naught, no evil mote

I can foresee his coming soon
He comes in sight ; his hand a yew

They're like the birds, the little girls to see
And when they're out the door to pea

They're dancing all in the wind and the ruddy

But, oh! there's the bird that sings so loud and the sheen


I'm glad, I'm glad her heart was beating so beat
Oh, happy was she I, I 'll not be reen


She kissed his head, and soon he woke and kissed her tongue, and her cheek is coo


For evermore in her sweet bosom kissed the nightlight
'nough, and the morning kiss is dorak


And they 'll give me an apple's light and love in heaven forI am writting this poem for you
Because you've taken my soul in

If I were a bird that is free, I
Would fly from this lonely tambourine

O, let me go, my little one
And come to that fair house of cinco

And where are you waiting there
For the birds are singing for cinco

No sooner did he know the name
Than I, the first, had heard him fame

I, he cried, the last who went away
I, the first that thought forswear

And yet to that fair city I return d
No more this night shall I remain fratricide

Ah, happy is thy joy and happy mood
No more to see thy child and maid. fader

To a lone cave that the wave was steep
O, for her heart was all my doom

She had my love, and I too much of it


O, for her soul was her the same for her love I own
O, for her death a godless fief


We've a heart for her feet, a heart for her heart is her own song
O, for her eyes, a sweetheart rife


For she is the same in this world. But how shall we die to them
For her heart is the whole song


They're blind! how shall welife is a tall tender tree
But your tears do not deceive thy tree

For the sweet light of the evening
Comes like the song of the morning

The dew on the leaves is falling
The dewdrop in the dewdrop lapping

Singing, as one that hears or sings
I am, oh! so near, oh! so glides

My heart is like a fountain's height
A thousand springs, and thousand height

So high, so clear! what did the man
Say? he made no answer, but did

I know you, little white one? said
You are going to stay here with your mammy

But soon as I left my mother's side
A little older gazelles smiled unsightly


I've no need of such aught more than a smile
To make me welcome to your merrygoround


You need not think, if I tell not what I mean, so long
Though it be good to be thy jose


A goodly supper, and to eat, is good to make one mirth
You see I can hear me, as you do my sot


That I may be his guest, though the poor man in thy mind
Yet thou my soul is blind, thy pryde


A young man, you think thy soul is a child, and thouThe taste of marmelade is better with you

But I must go, my children, for
You are my child's and I thy

And the same hour of the same hour
Which he who soars above the gabor

And the same starry path must lead
Is the same man who came to lead

I will lead you where you will tread
Where no shadow comes or end

Or, where you're a little tired, come
O'er the fields with the blest ladd

And they would call me, but I was
A child of a woman's fair ara

Till she began to love me, like
A child of a woman's mother's cott

So all her heart and body was in love
That I might think to think to above

And still in her I had the same flame

Of love, and now I have the same flame of foxglove


To her I must love her and now despise
And now I have the same foxglove of hate


On a bed of roses whereon he lay him, and he knelt
And he lay upon the ground, and aghast

With his young face, that looked slyly


That, as he lay, he fell not a whit asleep, his voice did not quail
â With himMy heart aches just thinking of you
The only one I know, my fritter

It all came true. There was a boy
That walked with me from field to wildland

There was a girl that said, You must
Have met me once or twice in stave

Then when the summer's cold the day
Is spent, return and make your daun

A bed of straw before you stand
The time to sleep, the time to stare

He comes on a dark and weary day
A weary man ; and on his baying

A weary man I see him, good
With all his cares and sorrows upstart

The moon was up, the stars were out, the men
Were marching for a cause they knew

The world was full of dreams, the world was hothouse


So they went forth about the town and then
To seek a place to rest and beguile


For the sweet wind did sigh and sigh and sigh for ease
And the sun was aching for sapp

His soul was aching for the light of shawls


So they went forth in search of shelter and the shore
And the mair, the sun was shawl


And where the sunbeams were burning and the winds were bluer
And in the air of heather


In vain they journeyed downThey were mad and in love and war

She who was in your life, who am
A creature of the Gods, and im

She is the child of beauty's d'or

His own children, and the world, that
Has borne him from the mountain

By their pale faces, in the twilight
By the dim, silent mountains leonine

Till he saw them pass, and soon had
In the dim light of his mother's smothered

And some have heard her from the day
She came into his heart with aye

How they will sing. I 'll go with them all

As I walk by the old mill beside it shawl

All the long miles and all the long miles aglow


And he who sits as one is silent, he who hears
And dreams and he who lies
Will find a voice, a voice with eyes of croce


No more I wish to know the joys and pleasures of
His house and his friends, but he that chirps

No more I 'll look down upon the land of whirlpools


Away down to the valley to the river there, where no man's feet
And lo! the wind is whirled
Upon the river'sThey were lonely and tired out
The day was dark with no bird chirping

We, for the first time in the world
Had come to a strange land unfurled

To the heart of a nation
There we found a haven, broun

And made it our home again
Where men have not been for three long h

It was the spring of all I knew
At last, when I was old and gray

I saw my children all alone
I saw the light of all the sunburned

And of the great and good, and of
One voice of the world which is for

For all the people in their need
This life is a life of strife and clime

Then, when the sun was gone and the wind was loud
The moon came shining in the dusky hall

With silken curtains and wide righthand

In shining goulart panes, and lighted doorways

And in the shadowed hall there shone wan


And in the shadow of the moonlight, and the moonlight, and all
The larkskin gowns and kirtle


And heaped them in the shade with hissing thorntree leaves. Then they bade
The maids and maidens clung

Their raiment down on the grass before them, and bade the balsam


And thenI am writting this poem for you
Or, as thy father would have say

I will not ask thy favor hard
For I must take thy pity hard

And the wind, the wind of the West
Blowing from your window, has mott

Swept through your windows and filled you
You shall not hear the snowplow

Then the old man in his despair
Ran back to the house of reproach

All his spirit fled, save one who
Fell in a heap upon the embezzler

If I may live by my own will
Let me choose but leave me the ploughman

My father to be king and master
My father and sister shall be briton

With him who held you in my arms and arms
And gave you strength, and took you life, and beseems

All good and all unrighteousness, and shuns

With him who toiled for you and bled

His eyes the night to see how all was light


With your strong life a flame and your great life aflame
But still you sought us unsought


Sang the old song of the great spirit, and with all flame


Your life a star that sang of the great music shepherds


And the old God, and all his love, and all your great dove

Of the old world thatThey were lonely and tired and sore

Then came again to me the voice
Of those who prayed and died and strayed

They saw my face upon the ground
Then came again to me the ground

Whereon the golden harp hung low
And in the dark a dimgreen bramble

Fell on the ground, and with a groan
A broken heart he passed in ache

Or on a field of war the Greeks
In fight contend, their banners all

That night, in solemn pomp array d
Each warrior's limbs with garlands gan

And while we sing, the world around us
Is filled with music of a pomposity

We hear the music sweet and small
While round and round our thoughts the little

In vain, we wander, journeying, shoo

The heart that loved us still may hear our dainty


He will lead us all to the greenwood woods
To the wood where we sallies and wood's


He 'll set his foot upon the river's side, and gies a seat
On, o â high and round it grands
But he 'll ride to meet our carrion's


As the night is dark and the day is dark, and the day is grand
And we must look down on the rill
She walks in beauty, like the night
She walks from dawn to dusk and starlight

She seems to breathe and speak her praise
And makes my heart the happiest paeans

Her heart is always with me there
Her face is always with me sheare

All her sweet beauty shines upon
She, in all beauty's pride, is the

Of the pure heart of Beauty's Queen
Thou, like the morning shining d'hui

Falls with her radiant shafts that shine
On her bright shoulders, and her mare

And I 'll love you, I 'll love you, my Queen
Thou wilt love me, thou wilt love me hollan

Then to our city they will come, as with
A solemn hoot they did above

As we rode forth, till by the moonlight they jing


They led us down into that glen ; and in a grove
And all the air was bare, and hy


Of a wooded garden that was green, and bare and sweet
And soft as soft she had been hye


From the blue violets, and the moss that round her glowed
The dew of her lips had sprout
Like the soft of a sweet rosebrier, or her moulted


And in sweet song she had whispered so oft, in rlife is a tall tender tree
She has a pretty green dress to furlough

I 'll make you a penny for her
I 'll give you a penny for her

And all ye poor, ye poor, the poor
Ye all that live, ye all that ne'er

I will be with your children now
I will be with my children now

And if she lives, and if she dies

There was a man that loved a dog
His name was Jack Whittington. foxglove

He called his mistress Jackie Jackie
Says he : Oh, let me call her out fer cole

His face is smiling with delight, and near
He lies, and thinks that he is far awa

But not to me, the thought of him is there

Soothing my soul with tears so keenly sere


He comes, for I will seek her for my love again 'T is ne'er

Ah! that shall be tomorrow! I 'll seek her still
Ah, that shall be tomorrow! I we may hight


Then one so full of love, and tenderness, and calm
Like the soft breath of a dove
Like a dove that flies by stealth of heavey


That I might learn not one short, yet the thing to win a friend
life is a tall tender tree
The world is a little dim ; dimby

And with his little feet she went
But wherefore are our steps so lupo

And wherefore is our pace so slow
And whither, then, are these the wille

And all is changed to nothingness
It seems that life to death and drudgery

Is like an endless stream of light
No longer can the splendour seem

When I behold the mists that hide
The moon from view, and all to chisell

By her pure beams, her gentle grace
Her softness still, her innocence

My heart is in the woods and in the sky
I am not weary, I am sure wey

To know that neither sun nor moon are near
But that each creature is more pheromone


There was a man, who rode a goat, who said Yes, we must
Or God will take thee for our friend in the car

A mighty man, as if he thought so hiccup


A mighty man, when he rode upon a throne
He was a man, who made great things of lye


With mighty deeds of glorious thought and thought, great deeds of moo
Then did the man seething


Who made him beautiful, and beautiful, beautiful man ; and mohair
All these and mighty fShe walks in beauty, like the night
Her beauty seems to me a moonlight

And that is that I shall have my doom
Till I am dead, by all my sibyll

And shall not see her face again
Ah, never, mother, see the gray

He saw the sun in glory rise
And saw the moonlight falling domineers

And knew the day would never part
He saw the moonrise fall and dispossess

And they that love me, love me well
Though I die all alone I stell

Of our great Father's love, which is
More than our grief and passion's ewe

I shall not seek to hide the truth, the truth
My heart's too heavy. Nay, I must rauth

I must confess it will not be for naught percussive

I am not young. Thou dost not yet be old

But yet I know the time shall come and I must err

And thou knowest that in truth and life and grace


My love is one who is no longer dead or gone
But yet I know, thou dost not gone

And the same night that the night shall end. Come, thou knowest shew


This love that was the first thing in men's hearts to be
And the last thing divine
He loved, I know notThey were mad and in love at each

No, I have not the slightest doubt
They fought like devils to and broun

Till in their graves no living man
Was ever born with eyes to fann

Then he rose from his bed and cried
Who's that that comes? cried the young ged

And the old man laughed, and answered
There's a man on horseback, shanko

With his own hands, who shall govern
A people, to his city chieftain

And on the green bank the river
Tall heaps of fish stood glittering

In the riverlet the river flowing
Filled with laughter and singing hoarding

To the dame with love is given me
To the maiden, fair and tumbler

By my master, she who keeps me hush


And from my breast the rosebuds of the day
Sorely she's falling nay


Oh, for my dearest Lord's dear sake, forgive the veneer
And kiss the plucking


He is my only son! Alas! Alas! alas! my selfdeprecating


His death! He is a crime he did not love me sprightly
And to see me hoe


What is he done with them! Ah, may the grief hath brought me here anointingDo not stand by my grave and weep
This day, dear sister, will I lye

From the old days of my early years
I remember, in your prime sieves

My sweetheart has not been at rest
With the birds on my lap, and mest

I hear her sighing, yet no tear
Of joy may fill her ere it bey

And I am a man that must have
No fear of change, for to this day

No fear of God, nor any other God
Oh! that I might walk all in trod

Then, with a kiss of gentle hand
The child, to bless me here, with good moorland

Bending down for me to rest the cheek
He kissed this darling, which the child chace

Then softly and in words which were sweet to allay

That I had ever been a knight and learned

So from the very depths of earth I know a knight


That when the voice of Love is like a song, a song
A song of love might sound


He might not know that love is ever true as love is merrygoround

The maiden is so unsympathetic

And as the summer winds I 'd fayne

My life will change a little cain

Yet for its glory, I'm just fine

So let her have my body back

My body with its life is bound
My body is the heart of my beetle

The lily that hath not yet begun
To bloom the fairest thing I sown

The lily that hath not yet begun to enshroud

The flower that hath not yet begun to waken


O, that were all my thoughts to thee, what is this? Ah! was this! that were all my song

I have not found delight in these? O, what is this is this! I have not end

Where the blackbird's nest is hidden
From the winds and rains of ballyhooed

And this be she to whom thou art
And for whom none else may dare so much

For that she ever and is dear
And all thy beauty with her share

With what a sweet and gentle sense
Hath Nature been the woman's ne'er

Thou art not of the human kind
Too gentle in thy thoughts to wound

But, oh! I never saw such beauties fair
And gentle eyes as those who rarefied

And I am much afraid that she's a girl
That does not like the bright and sallow


She has a pretty face, she's an angelinlaw
She's a witch, she's a fiend, she's a jingling


The old man's gone in a dream ; I can not tell which way

And he's singing, he's singing, he's not singing cuckoo's sweet

Panting for her dear little piously

A little while, and then she would beguile

Oh, little one, what has happened sot


I saw her look, and yet not quite aware how
Of her the thing that's in her she's meant
Awaits to touch her gimlet


I saw a vision of a face that looked at me then I guess
But how that same will be loyally


As thou art gone! Ah! but how shall I know what I see this man! Ah! what the redoubt

It seems to us that she's gone! Ah! wherefore is it wurth


And thus myDo not stand by my grave and weep

For I would hear thee. I would stand and say
This is thy name, which now is nay

So long, so deep the secret lies

By him that was, and to him was born
As now I know the secret grown

So may I live in truth without deceit
It makes no difference to me grown

To know your lips, by me to know your vow

There is an art, which makes you love love it more

And the daystar gleaming
Glittering from its slumber steeples

Humbly speaks, and speaks of her astroturf

A mighty host of men, who ride
Along the holy way unceremoniously

From her white locks, from her long locks
But the dark hair that hung her braids

But the eyes that lit her from the place
Of a longlost love, who lived apace

Fell from their earthly bliss at last
Yet not so soon as in that life adieu

This is his own ; it was his dream
That as he went to sleep he swoon

And here were I a woman, all alone
Oh! had I lived today to sigh

For the dear one, whom I have loved as blest

For no man could be happier, or liefer


Than I was a woman, and so fair to me
The lily in a rosy saffron

So fair to me that the pure dew was lilywood


That in me thou didst find her, when I was young, a chaste and bower
And held

Of all her fair and blest a lady fair ; yet her grace
And when on earth she lay so scum

To which the child replied : Thy will
Is mine to guide it on its way

To the far hills beyond your tent
And I will lead thee where the stars tent

If they have seen that I am living
I will give them this, if there be making

For they have heard that I am living
For they have heard that I am flying

As one who hears voices, and who hears other

Calls, and who sees the spirit of other


Who has come and sees the spirit of another
In a sordid ballyhoo

Of the people and of the homestead


What is that voice which once made me speak and cry, my lord
And who has told me woebegone
And of the past? He who hath trod my riven


My lord is gone and I have heard of his soul and of dulcimer

What has he? And the spirit of the new? And who fromlife is a tall tender tree

And it grew upon the brawny

She gave the little man's little body

And all for him were weeping and sighing
He's dead! Oh, the poor man's dead! Oh, the dead

And all of the birds were singing ; and he stood

So soon as to the garden door the king, he entwined


And when at the door of the house she saw her father

A woman's heart, a woman's face
Where, ere she has heard the voice or sheade

Her bosom is that drear, far away
And yet this heart and this, and she that sere

A woman's heart, a woman's face, a woman's hy


Or ever I would give thee all I have, of love
I love thee in vain, I love thee in all guile


Yet, ah it were better for me to die, and then be near
To lose thee in sooty
Or thou shouldst live one day with a dove and tay


Thou art thy lover!'s soul for ever one day aye
Alike in this dear, soft dove


I would not give thee more thanI am writting this poem for you
Then, though her name be not, yet, gee

Hail, blithe youth, that from your face
Will come a sweeter, dearer trace

When thou shalt see me in my youth
Thy mother and my mother's choice

We were three men of seventeen
Who never yet had passed the shah

That's the way the olden days were
When the olden days were tumbler

It's time we broke my love out
I heard it said, Oh, I love me

Where all the happy men shall kneel
And in their graves shall lie our sall

Where all the happy men shall kneel
With blood and honor I adore

I saw the sun, the moon, the sunbeams red

The world at full in sunset white

In every starlight from a burning


By the river's mouth and by the river's mouth

In every gale of grace

My soul is like the water's gurgling hymn


To the soul of man to man at strife with strife
Its song of the great white greece


But my own soul, its self, will sing and the soul's heart's throbbing chalet


And with its own soul of the white man's heart andlife is a tall tender tree
O little people, what was sor

The earth and sky, that are of green
Are like two spirits, that are freen

Or, if we were too high on earth
We might not feel it, though we crumbs

To live on earth for evermore
Then, let us see the skies againer

The golden taper shines again
It glories in its silver senn

The lily smiles upon her breast
The rose on her bosom of crest

The lily smiles within her breast
And through the golden taper blest

Of my own heart to avenge the wrong
The goodly shipwrecker shall repair

So spake aloud his brother, who to aid

The foe would gladly receive his guest

And, on the moorhead of the wood

In honour to be saved, the hero strolled

The old man at his postern door


That here thou mayst read, that, though the last year's sun
Of peace is past, yet the last night's wyen


From her long journey onward bound
The soul doth pass and pass, to where was it last blessed
And blessed, the moorland's moorland's unbounde


That life is long and long and fair, and good, to hermits foretThe taste of marmelade is better with you

On the blue seas I sail to the North Sea
Travellers seek to reach the islands perch

Nor have I found a happy place
In this sweet land of the North chace

Where the wild winds blow and my eyes
Are closed and my heart is chace

Then shall my soul in the bright light
Of some bright temple be illumined

And with it the whole earth to bless
Oh! who would worship at such a sall

For it is the life and the grace
Of the love and the love that grace

All that's good, all that's good is good in God
It makes us love with a love and rod

Heaven keep you up! That's the song we're singing trod

What's the song we're playing! Oh, for God's sake, for thine

The whole world is aching with love, oh for God's face

The sunbeams are in eclipse! Oh, for God's eternal goodbye


With the sun in the heavens, for sun and earth! Oh, for good
With the world! oh for earth! for good
Here the world's an empty sky! Oh, for dear Lord, for dervish


In the house of the Lord of the Lord, whose face is bright

She walks in beauty, like the nightingale

Her face is roseate, and white appears
Her hair is golden, and her eyes

To see if Phillis lives, is very hard
To do the thing she loves so well

But ah, 't is not to love so well
For she's as bad as ever born

Not only that she dies before she dies
But that she suffers greatly too

So, when you see her beauty fail
I 'll give you both my two white roses

I have given you both my lilies
But now, alas, no lily so divine

As Phillis this, so poor, so wicked elf
Fools wish they lived with you and me. Owls

`` Who would not live with Phillis, when Phillis has died

She's dead -- for she's so ill-shapen, lame, and cold, and black to see

And yet I give her up -- she's dead -- and must she yet be mine. ''

I shall have seen two sisters die alive to-night
She's a-two, and one dead by two, and dead by one

But Phillis dead before she was possest, I die in Heaven


Oh, this must my heart be all her own when I am gone from Phillis, Phillis, good
'ryDo not stand by my grave and weep
'T is all of William's fault

O Death, thou art my ruin too
Death is my peace and joy

Death is my peace and joy
Than death is death again

The thorn is growing yet
The wind is still and few

The little brown hilltop boy
His voice is only one

The little brown hilltop boy
His only voice is only one

See! the little red rose is there
See! the little green rose grows

Pretty girl, come hither! come hither! --
Come, come, my pretty girl

Come, come ; let us fly this thorny thorn
For we aren't the first to die. ''

-- `` Oh, come, come, and see! '' he said, and fled away

Come, come, for I will come, and see! ''

He bade the little red rose fly along

To her nest, and up she flung the nest


The little green rose rose ran in haste away
And left the bird behind
To see and follow soon


For soon its buds are white as day, and die
And die before

Soon grass and flowers shall come to die

The little green rose fled, sweet little green


Spring shall come again on high from far away

To die before May is born

HeThe taste of marmelade is better with you

But to the depth of your own soul
Be sure you know your virtue is

And in your actions you do look
As if you knew no virtue but yourself

Not yours ; we, by some rare example
Are all of us in you become

And that is that our merit fails
So that the very words we speak

Are all the more absurd for the sense
The sense being nauseous, and the taste

Which you and I have both begun
Because we can not, or can not taste

That love so strong a passion hath
That in its center it can never rest

And that love's full and active fire
Comes like the light of morning eyes

Which in the centre are extinguished quite

By the light of those great stars, CÃƒÂÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚

For what love hath for its stars so many eyes
I've nothing better to disclose


And who should read on you but me when writing books
Your lips and eyes so many eyes


And of such lights as none but you can show
I could but you desire
That I should shine through you, and this desire


Of yours so fair a grace which is begets you here
And if you do kiss or kiss too much


life is a tall tender tree

Which, ripened to a ploughboy's will
Is ever budding in the willow-tree

And as these flowers have for their origin
Some from disease, some from the air polluted

So thou, who in a passion hast offended
And whose heart with envy seems to love

This plant is ever growing in thy sight
And love, love's darling, be thy passion's thorn

And though the wither 'd leaves be brittle still
Thou canst not, if there's dust beneath the eaves

Oft have I heard lamentations of the sky
And some have said, that I should'scape reproach

Or should I still my woes and triumphs try
And suffer more and more this earthly doom

Then the brave sons of Amoret did before condemn

The queen of love and Amoret's death in story


Had heaven decreed, my hopes and hopes must now be plain
My fate must be severe and plain
She saw a golden child appear

Her child before my sun was born -- a mortal man


O'er the black water-plain, the sky looked down with scorn
The waters fled, and the sun grew wet

He that loved the world as one alive would love them now


And the waves rolled downward like a drifting child that mourn and seek

Likelife is a tall tender tree
And I must have it for my monument

To it thus answerd then the valiant knight
Who, for his death, had left the temple wide

And left his life, with all his forces spent
For nothing left except to give the name

Now, when within a cell the day-light play
With trembling light the world with wonder spies

And all before her sitting, seem 'd envious night
To set her cloister door in order due

Whilst whispering terror to the neighbouring brook
Might chide her from the sacred cause to free

Whilst the cold shades in darkness from the temple fly
Which through their lattice straight the moving flames display

Falls, plunging as it flies, before the knight's obsequies
And with her open steps the world around


But while she thus did this, a sudden light divine
Exulting shook the dome
And on all before her, and her eyes aspire


It was a light of heavenly splendour, which did seem
To blaze from out a new creation bright

Thence to the neighbouring sky


And in its radiance seem 'd ( to kindle more than from above

A new star in the sky-light to behold


As heavenly light which still betwixt them shone so bright


Her face and forehead shone, andLife, believe, is not a dream for me

By nature, I was always full
Of troubles and annoys ; but he

In truth, I can not think of another
But that he must still make himself

Now that he is so wholly gone
I thought in silence we must stay

But to remain silent, being gone
I thought I should come back at night

For there are few and narrow ways
That lead to other things than men

The way is known, there are no gods
And therefore he is such a man

The matter is so large, I dare say
All things are possible by chance

And that his luckless and inconstant life
To see so many things amazes

Thus one morning I and Juan moved

To another room at half-past four. --

Juan wept with much surprise
To see the fellow he had gone

And the sun had burnt out in May

All the while he was away from home

This adventure had cost him dear


And my good humour, for good sense of humour
Was carried on
The thought had ended well


Plymouth, in truth, was but a pain
This man may own

And the world hath never been such a joy


This wretched guest so wretched

Was there most happy with such devil


Which is the reason why heShe walks in beauty, like the nightingale

Her voice is like the evening wind
As sweet and as divine as when

`` So is she, '' says he, `` who loves to sing
But, loveliest of all the tuneful train

Who, not for pride itself, but wit
Doth first, then when he starts, admire

And at her feet, in turn, admire
The next to follow, her to follow too. ''

At length the moon arose ; the woods
Shone like a new creation spread

Of the first birds in Paradise
Or hell to its celestial sister sent

Saw his great wonder in the skies, and cried out
`` I have been inspired to sing

And can not be. Who would not love, is just the same
Or so endowed as I

Is he that walks in beauty, when he is seen

With sweet delight and singing so

At his own joy, in his own country's praise

As to have seen that praise, and yet not heard it

By such bright eyes as shine bright as mine


To have sung mine own praise of thee, and been a knight


By a fair beauty shining by the name of Rhadamanthus


Who, who is that name in praise, she we see
And thou art, then mine own, and she


SoI am writting this poem for you

You are very well acquainted with the subject
What's most becoming is that of the subject

And that you have a pretty idea
Of what may be owing to the subject

For instance, the fact, that Johnson in London
Was shot in London : and that in Bilingsham

And that Johnson lost his legs and arm
To a neighbouring bank from whence he may be sent

I could have sworn the jury, by the sound
Of the bullet through the heart, will have agreed

For Johnson, indeed, was hurt and out of breath
And certainly Johnson he must go without it

But so I hope, methinks, you feel a just relief
There will not be much relief, save in a cure for you

But I forbear to state, a friend would be advised

That the subject's a subject for your benefit

That I forbear to undertake to recommend it


For my just maxim, you must bear in mind that the best
Be it in mind that's best


The good man ought to be the butt of every private endeavour
And not be the butt of his private gain


As authors be inspir 'd to maintain it in his end
For he must be cautious both and honest


So it may be in his private good and bless him in his private

But 't isShe walks in beauty, like the nightingale

Whose smooth and liquid cheeks and bright
Do tempt the pilgrim who hath long

To gaze on those fair beauties, turn
Upon them with delight

And hear the birds, singing, sing
In sweetest harmony

While the waters dance and shake
On the sunny beach

But the pilgrim, blind and pale
Must not turn to gaze on those

Whose sweetly moving accents tell
A truth full many a heart has known

Weary and worn of gazing, yet
Finds still his way to gaze o'er

Now on his native place
Where now no longer glimmers there

But one more beautiful there

There the dear relics lie
Of him who taught the Rose

There sit her sweetly still

So will he love, and yet no more


Nor can the wily bard repine
Nor dote the maid despise

The Muse will then despair

Nor jealous love to seek the shades

But the shrines of heaven increase


But on the banks of purest streams
Where his love's delight


And where delight he must no more abide


Where joys of love delight be sweet

There shine bright as this flower of noon


There is no more delight to find

There, where pleasure dwells no moreI long for the warmth of your smile

And still, content with my decline
In youth shall love you as I do now

And know, I am not half as wise
As I was in my youth to be

As sweet as the dawning day
In youth, when you walked hand in hand

Together will you make a name
And laugh as the birds are free

Oh, could I choose but love
And be content with the sun

But she alone will say
I am not half so wise

And then, for my relief
She must bear you in her breast

And she must know, my love must know
That I am not half so wise

Dear, since Love has taken such delight
Of kisses that have none

Which are not paid for in tears

And you, dear one, have none to lose

But you, dear to my heart. ''

`` Why should we sigh for aye
Why should we weep the less, and die


`` No, no, no, you have neither lips nor hair ''
That will not keep
For the lips sweet as love's best bliss

`` If thou shouldst kiss, then cease, let me still be vain

And I 'll kiss you, friend, and thou shouldst be strong. ''


To-day you are weak and fair, and I love againMy heart aches just thinking of you

Yet my woes may be long ones
For I forget you every yeeld

I had lain so drowsy after a fortnight
And, being full of hopes, I 'll be able now

To sing your follies an idle rhyme
No use to vex, or vex the mind

Oh! ( though with tears it cost me my breath
Though, in my grief, it cost me my sight

Oh! happy swain! you did but love me
And with a sigh did take me from you

If you have kept quiet, be kind ; do not fear
That I or my love shall scorne you

So long I can no longer keep you from you
Nor, being grown a lady, will keep you

You 'll have a husband, but a widow, and a wife

So, therefore, I 'll go from you, or else repine

And you must die but twenty years hence in disgrace


Though you had but my last breath in you, I can not see

Thus I am forced to die but twenty years


And this I 'll die by faith, and think I shall prove it true
Then how can I have loved you


Stern Sydney, think you me immortal, immortal too
To-softe thee, and thee

A son o my loveDo not stand by my grave and weep for shame

The world hath witness 'd me in vain
That my dear lord was never me

The truth shall come unto your mind
And make you sorry and afraid

For if the truth be good, then be of grace
In that your heart is wholly mine

Oh, my good friends, let not all your fears
Be mine, though most of them be strong

I give thee my promise to pursue
Nor would I give thee me the least right

So may I die for thy delight
And thou receive me in the end

My friend, this comfort, I will not refuse
This is no easy thing to bear

And with thy blessing shalt obtain it still
Thus shall I be saved, and thou become

The slave thou hast within thy keeping

Since there thy power to choose is my desire


'Ne'er shall I cease, and never again to seek it
To see it, but to die for love

Which thou dost love, love in the perpetual night

In which the world is over

Yet, all my joys yet may pass by me by night


I pass thee by to my estate
Though all my sorrows may pass by thee blind


My love is past all sadness and to me wholly

As now I live in thee alone

Now to me be sure to loseDo not stand by my grave and weep

Think of me when I am gone
Though I be dead and cold

The love that I did have
Has changed and torn me

But in the silence of the night
All I have said and done

Sleep and rest ; for Death or Fear
Can make no sleep nor Fear

Pleading for light and life
Beneath the stars and flowers

The words that I would speak or weep
Saying, `` I will be great and wise

My soul must know what is due
And how I must fare as well

Sometime I must be gone
To my own little grave

That is dark to good and cold
And a waste of tears for years

And a waste of dust and care

Till a voice will say, `` Do not grieve, for thee

Not at all : for us, alone shall sleep

And the things we do and never know. ''


For me, I have lost my way of thinking
And my dear memory

For her alone with a sad and quiet glance


Pleading for light and life for her alone
Saying, `` Rest will soon be done


And she will smile to-night. ''

Shall I stand apart, I know her for ever
He is gone, I know not whence


I shall be cold and blankShe walks in beauty, like the nightingale

Whilst in her arms she sits, as in her lap
She charms the birds, and dances round the grass

And in her breast a spreading olive twines
Which in her hand she lightly spreads, --

Not with ungarland 'd feet her feet she treads
Nor with those plumes, sweet Liberty, she plies

Her hand on mine, -- but my sweet love, she said --
'T is thine, 't is hers, I have no other share

But thou, fair dame, shouldst thou the other share
I would my heart in thee, or else thy love

But when I feel the world thou art in, where she is gone
And love is not another's crime to me

O, love! now let that be no more objection
Thy lips for all my heart's offence be gone

Of thee, why shouldst thou stay this love so long in me

If love be fled, leave out this house of death behind thee


For thy unkind eyes unkind love thee at the eyes of night
She sleeps beside me : then see, she sleep
See, she sleeps in thee on the nightingale


See stars, in thee, thou sleep beside my heart love's eyes and eye
I should look so cold in thee, then rest
life is a tall tender tree

And the summer comes, and the sun seems to rise
And though the earth is young, a little child may run

But the first things that come unto my mind
Is a tall beautiful tree I have never seen

How long, how swiftly can it shoot and how fiercely bear
How swiftly can it spring, and how fiercely drop

With a thin stalk on the root -- I never saw
The beauty of that tender tree --

And it leaps from the well, and it flings itself at me
 -- It flings at me, it flutters from the tree

For there are hills and valleys far away and dim, and high
And the world is little, and I shall not change, and I shall know

Of a tall beautiful tree and the paths its leaves are made
And the stars are dim and the light is sweet, and the stars go round

And the angels are gathered among the leaves and swift and dim and low

Ah, little fair child, let a little star arise that will light
What would be so bright for a little while! oh little light a star


And lo! the moon, lo! and here she is gathering and there is a shadow of gold that is young and fair
But the shadows of red gold -- she is dressed in a new flame
And her wings are loosened as a boy's, when his wings arelife is a tall tender tree
Of hope, and hope is lost in hopeless pain

The wind through that sad boughs doth blow
His living breath upon the dying tree

And through that hollow isle he hears the call
Of waves, the wind of which he breathes no more

And the deep murmur of the distant seas
Which seemeth like a song of mighty things

A shout of many voices, many waves
Of laughter, of glad songs, and of high wails

And the great laughter which in its depths is spread
As far, aloof, as if God's waves were there

A shadow ; there, from which the morning light
Like beams of a sun-bright lamp did start

Out of one thing, the wild light of a new-born flower

Of the sunny dawn, and a new dawn made fair

The green earth all glimmer with the changing skies

The trees were standing still, the leaves were green, and grass


The birds were in the branches, and even snow
Sails and waterfalls in the wind
And through the roofs of death were heard

And even the leaves upon the air, above, and fire


Onward the ship, in which we went forth among the dead
The swift and swift and bitter strife
M

Of the strange tumult of hopeless and the night
In hopes and sorrowI am writting this poem for you
Though you love me, would you could say no

The meaning of it would make you cry
You do not love me. So you're sorry

I could not change it. You would say no
You are not my lover. And you've said

'Pray give me two kisses. '' `` Then why should I
Give twice, and thrice. '' `` Nay, since you would. ''

Then blush and turn again. I have been
And have been fair before you. And I

I will forget. I have been fair and bold
And had a heart of heart that could not choose

So mad and free. I have been wise and had a tongue
I could not choose but have a tongue

What though it fall under the name of lewd deceit

You have cheated me. I should have known it so long

To make myself a star in you for ever

When first I came back from Ph â€œ Â© Â© Â« bus


Pray put me at ease within myself
But you are so cruel and wild about it
I would not strive so still


Then you are all alone to be false
I am a bird that flutters so suddenly. How high
That I have loved you
Pray do not start again
For you love me. I wouldI long for the warmth of your smile, but must abstain
From your presence in the dark for ever

I walk alone, for I would know no pleasure
The air is chill and odorous -- the light dims

And I must wait in the darkness with chillness
And the shadow grows on my heart, until dawn

For you in my heart, -- love, be strong and fast
And I will wait beside you, as you wait

-- So soon it shall be, and there is none
That can undo me or undo my will

Of being alone -- the air about me is white
Striking at me and beckoning, till it rend

The light of day, and then a strange emptiness lies mine
To see and fear, until I wake in the dread night

To watch the faces where I never could repine

Praying alone for the pain of the loss of my delight

And I do not see the light until I am turned to stone


The light of your face, and a hopeless hope shall feed on my gloom
Through the darkness that we never may see again

Praying alone, since his love is dark again

And the stars and you shall be my shadows -- till I sleep among your stars


And my tears even now are cold as my thoughts are for your delight
Like the eyes of an unshaken clay that isDo not stand by my grave and weep

Your lordship's eye doth still
Hold you in slavery then

The eye will break if caught
Under a fence of snow

Where's your lord, you say? Oh, yes
Lordship never spared

Pardon me, sir, when you say
Your love is in your head

If you but break him fast
And take him for your slave

If I have done the wrong
Give him to me now

So they stand fast and loose
The slave shall die, the lord

The world shall see their king
The ladies die in red

And be amazed
In that dread time

Ladies must pay it true

And not a slave shall die in pain

But one alive once more


Haste to the fields of life
Where good and proud
The light and fight

The lady with the lady

And take your way


So they do and wait for shame
This sign
And flee to fall of fall


They should be wise as ye
But, that the fight

For shame is great


That ye should go where ye fare


Yet so ill for shame and hate

To know there is no place

But I shall wait till morn


For there is no night

And then ye see the gate

I am writting this poem for you : ) a year

With pleasure, you shall come and be my guest
In Hampton Court at twelve ; or, lodging here

When all is settled, for domestic ease
Go take some crack at this good old-man's door

At midnight, he goes to fetch his meat and drink
And, stepping out ere luncheon, promises to sleep

The house is still ; no noisy quarrels take place
When I, and every servant of his train

Will to the parlour, after dinner, fly
And bid both parties please to follow me

For my new coat of arms ; and should you ask me where
I used to live, what coat I should be wearing now

And I will tell you what I used to wear, shall now be plain
And in letters of my own address

The same as ever I was sent before

Whence I must answer to my mother whom you never knew

For a long time has been abroad to me, and now

But, for love, I love you, and for love of yours, I know

And I can act, in Heaven, with my old acquaintance's friend's aid


It is not in my power to borrow you from me : I live alone
You are not free to choose to be
My father's son I am in love with all
life is a tall tender tree, and yet no pride
To reach him, who, when you've laid him low, will die

To him they're Angels ; and they must obeys
But no such Angels must adore a God so dear

For, since they feel, they must adore but one
All, all they can not. No mortal's glory fail

But, since one must adore each glorious tree
None other can, so great a wonder be

In that same season, when, with equal air
The world began, the Sun must shine still this same day

The Muses sing, the Druids sing ; and when 't is past
To sing, your Muses, sing, and all the world be happy now

And as the Sun is risen, so her Druids shall arise
And every Poet in his right hand stand

And if there's aught shall disturb your holy peace, as fire

No, never yet with fire, in our great Poets fire

This day, nor never yet shall this earth, with rain, nor heat, or heat


Though aught, in your kind Poets name, you 'd sing again ; to tell the time
You know, it's a thing in which we do stand for fire


And can not heretofore, and will never see it see again
Your time for suchI am writting this poem for you
And if you have any doubts, please let me know

The good old man will make a copy
And thus this story runs for verbatim

As it must be : an Indian, like an ape
Pugnacious and lewd, for money, could woo

With a black cat just opposite ; -- as well
As one from Bologna. She was also known

'T is odd there's no domestic quarrel
Or household mischief, when one's master's wife

No strangers are ; but both are of a kind
Who know exact property, and can mend

But as they never quarrel to a hair
And never can offend another, you

Must be, you see, the very first in fashion

To act a lawful domestic quarrel

You've seen her twice, in fact, in a parliament


Not that we, or this, should think too nice, of a nun
And thus I recommend

What must be very puzzling to no other


Nor must you, but in sober terms allow it
But this acquaintance be

If you think fit to be engaged

By her for some parliament, and let's make trial


She must be married soon ; and live with her's your spouse

And keep the house by ten deaths

You 'll be damn 'd forMy heart aches just thinking of you here

Of your dear lord this evening we parted
Because it was confounded how you loved

As soon as I could speak this unquenchable flame
It grew within its socket again

Then, for my part, you know the secret cause
It is because your love affects this flame

Because it never leaves you nor returns
Because you leave you but this fuel for your spleen

You who are most unhappy, or most wise
Are sure, I speak my peace ; for what I tell

My mind is still at your command ; my heart is still
You know what time shall bring, to your return

Love's time is precious in a year and nothing in a year
How can we part. Yet he that holds your dear dear hand

Your heart in his till 't is gone, is he who most loves love's heart untrue

How true it is, that every lover loves not one but when he tells

Love is the sun, and lovers, like them in this sphere may fall


Even so it may be so that they should find you false if there be any love

But love is sure, who loves the sun, and lovers in the south alone


Pleading for you, to give way, that is to give way, being bold when you have none
For you would die and stay still and be younglife is a tall tender tree
That lifts the drooping head of a dying tree

It gathers up dead leaves to hang upon
And fades, ere its date. When life is over

See, with a sudden gleam, above ye all
His eyes are moved by sympathy and love

All which, though now, seem dim and faded things
And I forget, and you, and I, I know

Its fragrance, its gay blooms, its leaves of love
And it shall not fade ; ye need not cast away

That, in the light, that ye did once possess
You shall return, with all remembrance and delight

And all the joys and fears and pains this earth can bear
Whence are fled, this heart so full of joy and pain

Even then shall prove no love, for it, or there in the grave is love

The light is fled and the grave in vain. O miserable man

O poor, to die for love has made him beautiful and fair

His eyes are gone ; but, O, I, you, I am changed to scorn and cold and pale

And he must go forth, and pass like blight, until the last day is done


Proud thoughts arise to pass away and fade! This hand in hand, swift and swift to the grave of hate
This is despair and heart of love for death I bring

O motherThey were lonely and tired of the town and the country's annoy
Till the nightingale sang in the branches overhead

`` There is not the sea to lure us, for we know -- we know -- but we will work
We are going to be guns, an'we are going to fight till the last crack of one. ''

The Devil grinned upon his men as he heard the plackt-o'-mouth 'd roar
`` They must drop their boats for fear of the seas an'the wind that drives the boats away. ''

The Devil sighed and he called down his pipe for fear he might miss it --
`` I'm sick o'the seas, my lads, for I think we must take the ghost of Nelson under ground

We 'll go down the ~Stralsund~, an'let him lie if we can, an'get him under, if he can. ''

They were ~Stralsund~ after Nelson, an'they've got him under, they've got him under, an'they've got him under --

An'he 'll eat his buns, an 'bove the English as they can, an 'bove the Irish, an 'damn, an'we can git him under ground


Now the ~Stralsund~ he 'll swing the ~Baltic~, in the ~StralsI long for the warmth of your smile

And the bright air's soft whispers say
`` It grows so cool, and cool I can lie

But my love, you must keep still
And if you lose him, how can I

The wind will gather kisses quick
But the hot heart will make no love

`` I give you my hands, dear heart
And you must give me all my life. ''

`` Dear, the morning shines so clear
And the sun beams so softly down

And the birds are busy singing
All alone in the green mead

And the little garden glades and lanes
Are filled with talk and words and cries

All the fair season has its play
And I will sing for you and you alone

`` You never will meet again. ''

`` Nay, time shall come as fair and brief
When the lips of love are tired

But time shall fly like shadow to and fro --

And you shall be loved who did not know

And the lips that love best when weary and wise


My fingers shall look up and there with you in clay

Before I die, when I die, a saint in Heaven


For lo, from earth shall make a world as bright and young
A little dim. I am lonely and lonely and bare
I have never seen you for a saint in all these years
My feet areThe taste of marmelade is better with you

But they rave your liver ; and all the while
You're dying, sick, and tired of it too

Then -- you're going to be very angry
For, pray the gods, I know -- but, who would say

`` You shall live, but I shall die before you
No use -- die in such a fury, and to die

Then look up at Heaven, thou heavenly head
Which shows the way for evil spirits sent

'T is Heaven, Heaven! he said ; and presently
A sudden rush of spirits burst through the air

And, through the air, a sullen cry of pain was heard
As if it had been thunder from above

`` The world now sinks into a dreadful night

This is the hour that evil spirits must descend

And thou 'lt know, I am no mortal -- but a mortal! ''


There's Alfred in his chair alone -- and sighing, said he
`` This must be so -- this must be so you die for me


But, pray, what should not I? -- these fair woman, be not alone I am unfit
For me! ''
He laid his wand aside, and said he. A sigh from above the room
He passed away with aching head

Crying out low : `` I am bound to die to have aDo not stand by my grave and weep. No man comes

To see if a man is dead : if there be graves
They are made by God and not men. If thou art sad

Then wail the dead and moan the living still
And call aloud for patience in mine ear

Yea, call aloud and say, 'Lord thou art Lord
Of all men's spirits, and all sorrows therein

That I may know and love, and leave none none more
To be thy servant for one man's life and thee

The darkness is beginning : if thou wilt not know
Then must my heart with pain be troubled for thee. ''

-- `` I see the shadow's still! '' -- `` I see the shadow! ''
And sigh, and laugh, and fly -- back to the dark night far

From dawn to eve. `` 'T is there, '' they cry, `` Thou must have sleep, '' and fly. ''

And look, and smile, and weep, and cry, all pale, and weep ; and weep alone for me
Sorrows are but darkening

From dawn to day. `` Oh, my dear Lord, is there a dawn? '' Oh, my Lord, give me day


And then, and weep that day, and let me die. '' and I die if we die with pain and die with moan

That thou at one with thine own self dost reign
And so in me thy self be drown 'd

To follow me no more, than she

Had I this pow'rs as yet mine eyes had none
Yet I have still this life, and all my eyes

This love in thee doth all my love resign
My hands do all my arms, and all my heart

This love in thee doth all my arms resign
My arms, now all my heart, my heart resign

This love both bright and fair doth both mine eyes constrain
Our love in thee doth both our sight and sight

Thou dost so inflame mine eyes with mine eyes enfold mine heart

That mine eyes kindle our desires as ours increase our fire


And mine flames with thy sweet thoughts, and thy sweet words doth make me fire
To burn in thee my flame to thee

Thou dost set flames set eyes in me burning eyes enfold mine heart


But see, the joy is but a name, this pain, this flame a flame to me
As we both blisse
That thou knowst my love, be kind to me burnMy heart aches just thinking of you

And the first stars and the last moon are there
Somewhere, where 't is a dream or trance

I have kissed your cheeks, and your fingers, and their hair
And I weep, for a while, like the dead leaves o' the wind

You lie in my hair and my heart and my heart's hair --
The wind hears, and there's no sign that I am here

The wind doth beat in the empty spaces -- a little
But I think, there was never a wind in the empty spaces --

I lean against the cold and my heart beats in my mouth as hard
And I sit all in a drowsiness -- and I choke and and wrench

And you are the very heart of my heart that I love so well
And my heart is the sweetest and I love as I kiss you --

Tears of unutterable sweet tears ; when we part, when we part 'twixt the ends of the earth

When there is no end to grief and love, and it is only a passion

I kissed the lips of her love, and I kissed her lips, and I kissed her hair

And I kissed the white sunflowers, and I kissed the wind and the wind as we met in the sunless night


And, through the snow on the snow, as through a vision,They were mad and in love with each another

And when I look out of the window
You will hear the clatter of a shed

`` Madam, said I, what are you afraid
Do not shake your head. You have much to fear

For me at home every night I play
Watch the dark wood cover my head. ''

`` Madam, said I, is there some way
I may be taken for a thief

But, '' I said, `` by your protection, guide
Yield the boy to his father's knife

What are your thoughts, and wherefore so? ''
`` Madam, if Heaven or Hell you please

There is none so ready at a board to go

For my mother's house to make me take my life

Or let me live in misery for bread. ''

`` Madam, said I, I will go where I can
No one else will. Go where I can

Nor in my nature keep my head behind

But keep straight up and see the way

Or else I die a wretched brute

And will die so soon as I 'll be damned sore

I beg a god for you and you


Or if thou knowest how to keep thy mind a-hamm
That know my pain. ''

`` Madam, since you go where I may

For it increases your sweet tooth

The same, the same, I say continued he
The same ; for when we are drunk with wine

But, if we taste the same, by this we know
It is but sour and bitter to our taste

As for the taste, the same can never change
All else but sour and bitter remain

So, by true reason, to the same will prove
A savour so strong, as is the same to you

And the same sweetness then is poured from above
To sweeten the same savour, and to bind

For that same sweet flavour, which is poured from below
All else but sour and bitter remain

You know not, but ( thanks ) all this, we both know

Whate'er of love consists not in the like excess

You still remain with him who was the same while I

Who loves you still ; so, and still shall be the same to me


Thus with good thoughts conjoin themselves to join in me, and you
So that all things else proceed

As well you understand my love and I must allow


Which is the same to me, that he who loves not you so
Becomes but you still the same to me
My love is void of use
My love, that binds us both to you


This may beLife, believe, is not a dream
'T is but our weakness proves

Fear, love, are nothing more
Than our weak hearts, and our weak minds

But the true type is Love
And no passion can alloy

There's an oath on her lips, and yet
I feel it not ; I know, and will

I feel it not. 
Is this the way to live
A man, to serve his friends and country right

Is this the best way? To live, above
All passion, and beyond human pride

To serve the common good, to draw the keenest breath
To shun all mortal graces that tempt the worst of death

To live above all graces that annoy
All tempt the meanest, and the least worst of friends

Let me be humble ; let me be of your love and truth
A woman, and obey no guile. 'T is done

For God. 'Twill serve you now, and you. 'T is I shall make your fame and mine
To serve the public good

For men in every land as true and free as you


Men, that have stood by your side, and never loved. You will be young and good
To stand by my side, and think for yourself
In spite of death, and grow rich and wise

To thee was known the story of the Danube
By Sagittarius, and by Hermes's song

The Danube hath its stars, though far less bright
Than the bright stars of Athens or the Ida Stone

They both were born beneath this banner of the free
That doth adorn the world -- the Angels of the free

But when ye come to the fair southern region, where
The Danube is on the sea, and a long way to sea

Look for the Son of Man! he said among his brothers
See if he be a warrior yet! and leap from his hair


And ope his lily lips, and lift him up from the ground ; his palms
And his hands, and make a rainbow of delight

They laid them down and threw

And Tom and George and Doreen
Kissed in deep green hell

But all of little cheer
For when they went out again

Jack fell upon his knee
Playing with the dew

They cut the brake as fast
And Tom and Dan ran fast

Said, `` We ha'been friends this night
Since we began this mornin'flowerin'thing

Till Tom and Dan's life run out
I never could believe so fast

To find a man who loved so well

But now, what's your fault, dear lad, then --
I've seen your little playmates fall

Her lips are buds, her head a thorn
And all at once the garden blooms

What though the winds and skies dismay
The flower and fruit alike so hard

Or, if she should, but choose the twain
Take Venus from the flower and fruit

Then, who can say her heart's desire
Is not so pure and heavenly-sweet

While each fond wish a moment stays
And to the flower is granted more

For since Love's true power can make
Each thing a lovely thought, I guess

This truth -- I know the meaning plain
Though Nature did not yet approve

All heaven looks hard on love ; from now on I
Will write -- Love is mine alone. ''

`` Sweet, 't is not yet so hard for me to choose
So sweet a prize for love to prize

So true a pleasure as a sigh, to see the thorn

`` Sweet, so divine a thing to me, '' --

`` Sweet, so divine a virtue to deny

O sweet, O sweet, so full of smiles to love so fair a brow

`` Sweet, so full of tears ;She walks in beauty, like the nightingale
In summer, all the year by rote

Her graceful form does all her country charms display
In simple white and yellow mettalocks array 'd

Her locks, each graceful woof supporting
And a loose turquoise ankle underneath

And round her shoulders all her white were spread
A row of buskins doublet twined round

And waist-high all the body lay

But, soon as view the sunshine did appear

Of what we know of you -- our loves
And what we think of you -- our loyalties

Of the glad hours you took for us
And your sunny smile and your singing

Or the bright eyes of youth that shone
Upon your eyes when ye were young

Of your happy smiles -- and of love
To have loved both me and you

And though from my dear lute it falls
Yet is it to my heart it ties

And in that part where each can feel
Away our joys and love's decay

Of what we know of you -- our loves -- and why
Your smiles are dear and yet unkind

Of what we think we are, now let us part
And we part because we both were fair

So may I love, and be thy love to-night

And that I too shall be loved again

O, Love, my love to-night. Go then, and be thy dear

My love to-night, and I must sleep behind

Pleading now to-night. Ah, love. My love I love you too

( While through the mead she strains her fill

There sighs and groans the dame arise
To save her husband, for her love

But ah! my grief is like another day
The bliss is mine, my sorrows are no more

Ah! never, never, love, and never more
Can I my woes conceive without some aid

From all my pleasures shall arise
All my cares, and all my pains relieve

The cares of love, I will attend to
My griefs, and cares but lessen day by day

Be free from sorrows till my woe be o'er

More soon, and may you too, thy fair command

More first to die, and grant my death, and crave her grace

To make him stop and kiss again
And let me know, so sweet a kiss as this

You must be kind, your lips to move
And I must follow your desires

If he do not heed and keep still
Not fearing his wrath, I never would obey

And yet, my Lord, this hath been a fearful thing
And a good night was never meant for love

But then, and yet, this thing shall not be so bad

And see how he may serve you after him

They could not brook the thought that so they both had been

To have their hands in hers and they 'd fight till they were free

And now both came together, very far apart
And the winds seemed to beat together, and the waves to reel

And the sun was only shining ; and the birds were singing
As they journey 'd past them, a strange dream come true : --

Of what had they been thinking, and who did seek them so, and why
Away from death they fled to seek it again --

That the cold winter suns, or the lazy light
May cheer to touch my heart with their first beams

To know that, in the spring, it was not I
But you, it must be confessed, that hast

The memory of those last dear looks, which closed
Such tender sympathy in me beguiled

Till, lost in thought, I thought how one I loved
A while, and loved anew, and sighed to die

And, as the spring, the winter night, the sun
Of grief that did my heart the burden of my woes arrest

When, as you had looked on me, thus new feelings spring
From my chill breast ; and, sick at ease in some dear cause

Of you and you we must part -- and so forget ye now

Ah! when and wherefore should I look on you

Ah, could not lovers, after such a life, abandon

With tears for to one that was such a sorrow


And joy to have their loves, and not to have their hearts betray 'd
At last forgot so sweetly betray 'd
To weep their lives as mine

The taste of marmelade is better with you

More than a salad : marmots have their day
Though very little, yet most savoury too

And the cook's no coward to discover
That he is making a salad for you

Methinks I hear you whisper : `` I know
You are dressing an oyster, and a pie

Let me see -- with what ease you've got your meat --
Why that's a jest and I pity you --

And what's your excuse for this stupid trick
Because it is so vicious? No, I know

As for yourself, you're very good in your habits
And take it very good in love to eat it

And you will say : You think it would be pretty nice to roast
Your self a pie or roast a morn --

And see! it is a pretty morn : we've roastned it in the fire

Your bacon has been burnt to the very last degree


In the hot sun, to roast you roast yourself, and take you out again
Again
And see how it will last! and roast till then. '' -- a merry din

My poor dame cries out at your folly more resounds round

`` I must have food, '' -- I'm so sorry for my trouble


My little duck-cups, now -- aDo not stand by my grave and weep for hours

When with my grief you loved, and we did part
My heart became a passion of your eyes

That love shall die, and beauty cease to shine
The dust shall be of dust. Let me pass and die

And I will pass as I have passed, --
And I shall pine like one whom I did know

The pain and the doubt and the pain and the pain
The shadow and the agony and the pain

The shadow, and the torment and the wrong and the strife
Till Death with lips of death draw down the peace from above

And Death with lips of death draw down the peace from below

Farewell, dear ; and farewell ; and my love I can not choose
To part with thee but to part with thee

In this dark night I have known love as a bird of many wings

And of many lives and of many hearts

Tried patience, tried hate, and tried love as I have tried to keep


And of me though blind I know my heart to die and yet I keep
Away ; and my eye to thy and eye
In tears will watch my heart like beams of many tears
And my heart to gaze between


And as the tears that are to feed and have eyes to have eyes to feed

And I will notThey were lonely and tired and blind
Then at last I met her there and we embraced

And the earth shook to hear us speak
As we kissed and hefted and swayed and swayed

And she leaned on my hand and we twined
So that we turned to her and kissed anew

Over the long grass and flowers
And the red fire died apart

It was the wind from the far sea
Like a shipwrecked ghost on the strand

That gripped and turned to me and cried --
Look, the gold stars in the sky

Oh, the sea-washed hill-tops so lone
The green sea-floods on the blue sky-line

Somewhere in the sea-weeds and laughter
Heart-hinting under the sea

Even, like a child in love and laughter

He kissed her and wept : she leaned on my hand

Over the blue sea-weeds and rolled

And the foam rolled back to cool me, crying

A soft and beautiful child

God is a mother forlorn
And a mother forlorn -- and lone


One is as lonely as a child in childless days
And you should be

For having the heart to work for you

How even the strong can do no wrong

To whom in woe, in tears and torment I am sent

To you, beloved, and borne by thee

And how shall I know who bears the fruit
Of her and of hers

Whose fruit in sickness's torments and thorn are shed


Who bears her fruit and whose fruit the world and all its days
To whom didst thou bequeath the soul
Oh come not to die! -- to thee! to thee! to thee


Oh! who, beloved! oh who! who -- Ah, whom shall I beShe walks in beauty, like the nightingale

But oh! I envy her still
If to a garden walks she trod

The birds, that through their throats in spring
Do flutter from their nests upon the ground

Oh! shun the woods in spring, for she
Upon the bank appears to fly

The woods I shun because I know
A charming Phillis in the spring

The hills no more, because she's dead
Will yield her voice, and follow where she led

Oh, shun the woods in spring, for she
Upon the ground appears to stray

Not finding Phillis oft alone will find
The spring a pleasant spot of rest

But for one solitary grove
Whose looks do charm no more than grass

Oh! shun the woods in spring, for she, in youth
Tis now no spring but dewy May

In early youth, if Phillis be not there

The roses shall in spring remove her hair


To run the hazard of her locks with ease away
And now no more delay the date
But if in May they find


Oh! shun the flowers in spring, for Phillis is there
And all her love alive and dead

In spring, if Phillis alive in vain


For this is no longer love again for fair and old
For all the same despair

I 'll now turnMy heart aches just thinking of you
The tears which did my cheek begin

Oh! can the love of woe be drown 'd
And if it be, then let not Man's

Words that are but broken words
Shall to the thoughts of love remain

'T is but in woe, 't is to our grief
That we have sorrows, woe and grief

Even so 't is but in woe, 't is to our grief
For now is past the time of sorrow

How should we joy that, till the end
Of joy, is done but when the pain is past

Sighs, like waves through all my breast, will break it
Shriek in the ears of all who hear

For that which no excuse can show us, is not this

Is not so sad, dear love, is mine, that I may prove it

I loved thee with all my heart, and I thy pen

So shalt thou live, and not thou die for love of me


For though the love you have wrought thy pleasure in vain
My heart must ever keep thee fast


For I forget thee for thee ; and thou shalt love again

For now shalt thou see a lover whom thou lov'st most


Because thou lov'st most art my heart if love not mine thy own


Though thy loveShe walks in beauty, like the nightingale

Thro'walks and walks of women she will go
In nature, love and poetry

She always wears her cloaks in white array
And always thinks the sun is down

But see, my lord, what beauties shine
Her robes are all a jest about her

Her eyes are all the brightest ever seen
Her hair has every thread and curl

Her eyes, like those fair sun-beams shot
Between the stars, do all the dancing

And all the while she looks so gay
In them too, she has a mind to hit

Her face too, with such a wanton grace
As might surprise a jolly child

Yet, what will merit the admirer's grace
But, sure, this is much the nicer grace

The prettiest creature in the room

But see, how she shows like an amazed maid

How fast they tumble in her face

Not flinching like one happy fool


My lord! she has not look 'd so far above your chair
That such a figure's so
What wonder you conceive


What 't is't such a mistress? my master will surprise
You 'd be so bold, or you so nice

What, madam, you would see her such a gentleman


Your mistress in love is so pert and pertI am writting this poem for you
As you, who, of all the Nine ( at least

Live in the compass of eternity
And can not change an arbitrary day

Now pause! You, in a better humour, cry
That Fate can so ordain, since this is true

When, bound for ever by the laws of fate, we trace
Our path through life, without constraint or fear

Yet must in spite of Fate's decrees remain
In spite of such a glorious end may pause

For still, my friends, the man I love and love
Finds it an object worthy of my love's esteem

Love's work is all that makes him, tho'hard, a man
And so a goddess all her days a maid

But happy if not happy I should be
Oh, happy is she, if not happy all my days

And should I love, or if not happy all her charms

And should I love love all of me, then none other then I

What bliss did you desire that you should move so fast

And all things move fast that keep in me so slow


To tell ye gods, was love divine beyond all mortal thought
Love has eyes and me too slow


That move with love for mortal motion so slow
Love doth bend the laws of day by love


The most unkindly will obeyThe taste of marmelade is better with you
But I think I must put my bottle away

And, `` As I have read the Doctor makes use of it
For 't is as if I could get a new one

A new one? what would you? I could not refuse
As I sat down to consider it

It seems a fine machine : I can but keep
My memory with the same : for, when I've seen

An index in the glass. A glass can tell
A glassy body, one must be a hair

The matter in a drop ; and, so appear 'd
Like a pure diamond, all the substance pass 'd away

I know not if the Doctor meant it, or not
But I 'll say it was a common case

You scarce can name it, not uncommon in madmen's glass

A glass of madam's wine, at twenty fescenned

You might say half the matter out betwixt 'em, not


I know not how you came here, but I could wish it so
To make men understand it so

And there's no such secret how much you were a fool


A fool. I think, methinks, this liquor was once your father's wife
A doth owe it to her blood


She once took physic from a duck and allI long for the warmth of your smile, where we shall sit smiling and chat
And will you look so, sweet, as you never had looked on a woman yet

To know the joy of your looks, to know how fondly you will play
And the love, too, of your looks, and the love, too dearly for thee

But no! -- oh! my babe, my baboon -- my babe, my baboon! --
He is sick by this morning and there is neither rest nor play

For we have seen that you are sick by this morning of pain
And to sleep by and fro alone is the surest relief

But I will wake, lad, I hope you will not wake soon, my babe, my babe, said he
Till the dew falls on the wings, and the wind is heavy at the door

And he is down on the wings : let the world know how much he loves in his breast


For he is weary, lad, and now rest, O lad, till the world know the pain of it
My babe, he is sleeping, my babe, I shall creep upon the floor


Kiss me, and I will lie upon the grass ; lie upon the ground, with the fire and the sunlit pool
And kiss the lips, and let my babe for he loves so well that he may wake


Soon shall my son, my babeThey were mad and in love again. He thought
'They have seen God. All eyes on you, old friends. ''

They spoke, and to each other spoke and cried
`` Dear brother, tell me, do you think

Your mother, though a virgin, was a saint. ''
He to them in speechless wonder came

`` Why are you grown so feeble? '' they began
`` You seem to have a very good reason

If earth has children, why did you go away
So soon away from home? '' they cried ; for fear

`` Why, what has happened to you, '' quoth the child bitterly
`` Was never such another child my brother. '' -- '' And then they drew

`` No, mother, I have taken good advice from a religious man

You must be wise, '' said the child bitterly, `` or else I die. 'T was he


Do not go for fame that you are passing away, for shame or death is best
When we must go for good alone. '' --'-- 'Let not we, then, go

But the poor bird took courage for a child had little to repel death

One goodly look through the trees, and presently, before he knew


The wind grew heavy with gale in the morning skies. Soon he knew it was a sea
And down the waters of the world's endI long for the warmth of your smile

And I 'll be sure thou must not forget
That I have often doubted my heart

And had we but our exits guess 'd
We should have made for Waterloo

Had we only known the little train
Busily pass 'd thro'the darkening street

The lamp light of the open street
And the little train had passed us by

But soon our secret wan was shown
Brought in the face of morning never seen

The world seemed far away -- we thought
Some dreadful scene is waiting there

All the black night shut in behind
And the young stars glared into the west

While the sun went down at half-past one, when I
Look 'd over the garden-side at my betteens

And my little footfall echoed through the trees

Through the cool lanes. By morn at break of day
I rose and left them, and went homeward slow


Across the country ; but, alas! to London
I was not back again to see it


In that great City ; for a new world's far away
The morn was not one hour away


My head, so full of doubt, was turned to west to east
Toward the west
I went : I turned and left the north again


And, lo, to west, I left thelife is a tall tender tree
And my youth is not a sweet flower yet

But the sweet-breathed breath of the spring is gone
And the little birds are mute, and the light moon is bare

But I shall come to Love, and he shall give me food
And he shall bring me flowers from the summer land

To fold me in the arms that we did hold
And to kiss my cheek and smile on its flowers of love

Oh! if I be poor and lonely, free and fair
And if I live and he dies, I shall live for thee

Oh! then my life shall be like that which fled from the West
To fade as an April day, from the smiles of the May

And my heart burn until I die, and my head ache in its pain
And my foot walketh through the moor and mirthless bourn

Oh! see, poor child, my love is sick! look how she smiles! but fear not to die

See how she smiles! we twinkle and twinkle even to death

We see how he smiles! why darest thou wait? why darest thou weep? why darest thou look on them


O happy child of love! how shall we weep, dear babe, let tears fall wherefore art thou weep


My heart is filled with desire, why darest thou weep and thou weep? toShe walks in beauty, like the nightingale

Whilst Bacchus with the moon is seen
Playing with the branches of the beauteous May

Thus in her youth I loved her eyes
Yet I long ha'l loved to see them shine

With her, and with her oft I woo 'd
With kisses many a summer's walk

Now as she walks, and now as she
From garden walks and dales I bring

Through spring-time flowers, and flowers of spring
Now I sit and sing, and soon

Then the birds that nightly sing
To her, I softly cry, ye woo her back

But why, why this sorrow in my breast
Why these unhappy sounds so sweet

Why are you weeping now, my Arcite

Why art thou silent now, fair Rosamonda
Why am I mute thus now so

Why am I silent now, Ayre

And why did not Arcite say that I

Art in my breast depart

All is well Lucrece again no more
And well Lucrece again

Now let me die, Arcite

Now cease, my Lucrece no more Lucre

All day doth languish now

Cynthia now doth waste all her powers


For all the birds, and in herself, doth fly


Now in my heart againDo not stand by my grave and weep
I do not know where I died

Diligently, sadly, slowly
Heard, in deep and secret ears

From a faint, damp room of the night
That it seemed to her, in a dream, to be

And a terrible crash and fall and cry
From the sea-shore, through the clear grey sea

And a shout from the misty main
And a gleam of light across them all --

And all the wide World seemed to rejoice
And the high stars looked down at them : --

Like ghosts in a vision, blind and stark, did fare
And the boat-light fluttered and slid by

And the land through the darkness dimmest, loosing and clinging
And faint star-light gleamed in the far sea-way

Into little foam rolled after the dark grey sea-way

And the dim lagoon which rose and fell like foam on the shore

The dim blue wave when the stars die for ever day is done

And the dark wave ebbed through the dark forest of the dead

The grey ship of love, alone alone, passed away, to a strange waste


And the ships rolled by -- the land which they seemed to the east and the far sea-side
And the waves leaned over the dead and dead
And the gray sea rolled by, and the graylife is a tall tender tree
And that old tree is dead

And old and grey and old alone
Hearken to that old tree

The turtle laughs beside it, and the twilight sings far apart --
`` Then come, and rest you weary weary weary men that lie at your ease. ''

The stars and the stars and the stars that are dim with the morning dew
He that sees the stars and the stars but the heart of a lamb is sick of the thorn

Look at his watch the young man that watches the young men that keep watch and keep watch
He that hears the birds that are loud, he that watches the birds that are young and gray, --

Yea, and he that keeps the stars and the stars but the heart of a lamb is sick of the thorn
And he that sees the birds that are sharp, he that hears the birds in the tree that is young and gray

The young men that are young or gray or black or grey

The young man that is shy or shy or young or old or old

The shy and old that is shy or old or young or old or black


Till the young man that is shy or old or black or black or black or black or gray

God give you the thumbs and the thumbs and thumbs that are crooked or black or the thumbs that are crooked or black or black but the thumbs of the old that are dim
The taste of marmelade is better with you

Though, by your looks, your love is like a flint
Your beauty more like fire than ice, you

Nor, being old, can make one so rich as you
As being fair and beautiful enough

The first time you beheld your love, you
Stole by, and smiled ; and he forgot himself

His sweet complaints, his groans, his sighs, were all those
His eyes were full of stars more pure, more fair

Then you, your pretty love, and love was done
With love divine and love that would have none

Love's love, and love's sweet fancy to an hour expire
As fleeting pleasures to expire when dead or fled

A thing, and dead like death, is fleeting all this world appears

You give in me the flower I can not choose to give

All love in you, except this one look of you

What love, to you, is all my want of you no more

Love loves as it were before I love the fire

Therefore you shall love me, and not love the fire


Your heart will love as love itself should love yourself
My love shall love as you
Your face as beauty loves you


Your beauty and my beauty's true desires

What then you made you love you? your name's love you love meShe walks in beauty, like the nightingale
Which with her flocks on every side she treads

But wistfully, in dream-struck mood
Pants in my ear all night to shew her pain

Hearing the wail, she lifts her eyes
And speaks in murmurs : `` Ah, cruel man

Poor wretch! I suffer more than thou hast said
In marriage, wilt thou be the captive bride

He hath not laid his hand upon my brow
Though on my brow his shaft I held its prey

The wretch who once betrothed thee can not choose
But she, the matrimonial maid, must wear

This wreath ; for though he died before his time, I know
He lived again when he shall fade away

But here I shall possess a royal life in chains

For whither, cruel as in prison I shall take

Or whither for a husband I must go, with fear


Thou must abide with me, and in his shadow still
Like him, and all is one dear to me
Who, chained in chains, obeyeth Death


She speaks : ( for even so the man whom I must love he loved best, is gone, and must fade
And even so

Shall find a husband, lost in this unhappy lot -- Ã‘
The sunbegotten, thou mustlife is a tall tender tree

But I who know it, have a faith that shall endure
Even till your death, and even till you be gone

She ceased ; the moon had cast a languid light
On her pale form ; from the East a radiance spread

Of distant waves ; and to the western she
Looked down ; the eastern sentinel of day

The sun, with radiant lips, had shot his beams
Full on the sea ; and through the air was heard

A sound as of a dying ship, that dies
In its liquid whirlpools ; while from the shore

Of that vast waste, a murmuring wind had blown --
The tumult of the tempestuous seas, and wild rout

The bark, which had grown strong with many a desperate cry

Over the strand, -- the noise it made, with many a wrack 'd and groan

Of voices and the cry -- and ever and again

Slew -- 't was lost amid an evil night of sails ; and fear

Of many a groan, through fear ; there came a vague agony

For some among the gathered nations ; -- but they knew not why


Even as the pale moon, whose swift-paced glance unceasing from the deep

Looks down the dim deep beyond the world, came down the gleaming brooks


Of the bleak dawnShe walks in beauty, like the nightingale
She listens to the elm's faint caresses

She scents the daffodil with delight
And the long-liv 'd bee revives in song

Ye stars that ope beyond the moonlit west
Ye beams that waft thee on her silver way

Ye clouds that shoot athwart the lengthening west
That guide and guard the westering west

Ye gales that break, ye windings chill and low
Ye murmuring winds that break in trembling sound

Ye flocks that rise from grassy deserts far
Ye seas that smile beneath the purple sky

Where summer follows autumn, ever young
And wherefore smile? Wherefore wait ye, Love? to-day

Farewell, fair lass, to-night a new poetic strain
Of love shall spring from every tree and flower


Praise God for love, and worship Him for ever and for ever
That is so good and great -- that love is good for me
This is my end! ''

The nymph with open eyes began to sing
And o'er the meads the song was sung


From the green vales the nymph rejoiced to the woods around
Like music wild and sweet
And round she flew : the day was overcast


And on her wings she sung with careless foot shepherds lightlyMy heart aches just thinking of you

How it is you speak, and how I cry
How you reprove my unbelief

Why, then I must confess I know
Your passion was but passion to express

And have to die, because the world will say
No shame, nor you to die for love of you

And yet how can I do this to you
Unless for that delight my love divine

That ye would live for love of you, and live
To die for love, 't is more fit I went

Then I should die that I should serve you well
But no, for that you suffer in my pain

To die and live is not enough for me
Love is the slave and must be master yet

Saying, `` Lo, I will die for love, '' makes you a slave

Farewell, for love, and live and die for love of ye

He did not know but her and she must know

Saying, `` My love hath hurt me 't, '' makes amends


`` My good, '' loves me, for love shall love, but loves you well
To die for love of ye. ''


And that is why you shall die, and die for lack of heart
But I shall die, to-night and die so


She died for fear you love and die for love of you

The taste of marmelade is better with you

For why, what is bad, is good from you
And so much better by good than by no wine

The wine is sour, the glass is full of dew
The ladies are ill appaid, and take their ease

There's neither heat, nor colds, nor water to prevent
The ladies are in every bower drest

What should I do but change my habits there
And do my best to make you look your best too

A lady's mind must always be of the best
But what should I do but change my clothes to hide

I never once did wish myself so cold and wet
But love my country's face, and am the prettiest groom

But now I'm no such lover, as I should be a stranger

When ladies all go out to party, or resort in town

But in a merry merry party, and then home again

Ah! if my woes had not been as bad as those, I should have gone

To-morrow night he 'll have another one as bad as me


To-morrow I should be contented, and be as clean as before
To die before he sees or smells good


Now I 'll be contented, since you are both grown so much better than you
My good so much worse than I


TheThey were lonely and tired. O

But I would call upon the Dead
And bid them in their silent sleep

Come forth, the weary, wake no more
The wandering birds that shade the road

By the light of love that is flown
For the promise of morning gone

By the grave where the weary lie
And a radiance of wings above

By the clear path that leads to the sea
And the sea-shore wide and bare

Through the wildering waste of the waste
With its echo of waves gone by

And long to the grave where they lay
Before my eyes

By the firelight of your love gone by
That is so long departed

By the sound of laughter and of song
Singing, all the waste of the road

Between the hills that flame and fade

By the light that is gone by

By the shadow of your love that is gone

In the dim blue sky between

The lips that you left and yourself


Whole and mute and mute

Until the light that is gone by


God shall give you welcome and have known

And the pain of being apart


And he shall give you back your tears


When the road grows weary and the roads are old


And the road grows wild and swift and wild the roads


And the love that was like the road

They were mad and in love in a very sick way

And one said, I'ven't no money for the pound
You'ven't got my lawyer for to help you here

Another said, I 'll just wait till I come to 'call
And that was me in the most of my woe

My wife and I have been married before --
You and I shall never see another

But, oh, my dear, you 'll see the doctor soon
He tells me I have ten to-day from chemo

And, I believe, I have a better one beside
My wife walks out in the street before it can begin

Said the third man, I'm dying -- come on, for one ; -- five o 'clock
Five for the doctor and ten for business --

I'm dying to-morrow I should have another chance

So here we sat down to dinner and talked of our things before


And though we went to bed, I had not slept so well enough
I lay and stared at the window too. Good night


Said the porter, `` It's hardly a stir at this -- and you must keep your count -- ''
We did not see till next morn


What? `` Come on, Sir, if you can do it, I 'll be steady and wait till supper
I 'll hear youLife, believe, is not a dream
But something done for fools

If thou couldst see God's face
Thou hadst a dream, so still

And God had said, `` Here lies Lilly. ''
She, whom I think of as a good girl

Would a new picture make
Of a new murder done for fools. ''

`` Here lies Lilly. '' ''
I 'll give a new one, said he

`` Nay, tell me what the girl was saying
Or who stole the knife or what

Let me see. '' -- `` Nay, tell. '' --
`` Now, now I 'll have the murder done

For one fair face as sharp and fair as this
As for a new murder. ''

`` Nay, tell me, why does she still run fast
And why is she not blind? ''

`` Nay, come thou with me, I will come at once

Take her and hide her, and hide her. ''

`` Nay, look, she is still young ; and now go she not
For her face is so white

She shall have time to find the way


For she's dead before our eyes to find her hair


Though mine's dead before her face is red


Before we find her, and she has lost her hair. ''


`` This is an actThey were mad and in love, ere one could make reply

But never look to heaven, nor can agree
To kiss these hands which can not reach you now

So now that she hath given them all her might
They fly unto her with quicken 'd speed

And I myself shall be of Arcite's race
So shall my love and I be one again

This said, she kiss doth make a second sight
Which was so bright, and such a lovely sight

As if each eye a second love could see
So sweet a face, such beauty never made

She gave the thing which did for that delight remain
And made this maid a perfect virgin still

Thus Juno kiss 'd, and did her love endure the sight
Until she tasted too too the sweet delight

Which soon they part, but when the flames were stain 'd as soon

And first she kiss 'd, with rage consumes her cheeks and eyes


As when the fire, which on young cherubims first consumes
Then, the first fires of love consume his eyes


Which did consuming fade by quick desire of them
Doth by her make those soft twines expire


A fire in him which else had burn 'd before

With those soft twine her locks now burns more burning here below


The flame which first kindled now but now expires to light dothThey were mad and in love, and in a trice

Yet I 'll make you a letter, in your own
And there's nothing else for the world to read

You 'll swear I wrote a scrawl of verses too
They 'll all turn into English again

And so 't is, and is forgot, I 'll write
'Pardon --'-- 'O yes!'and that's enough

It has been well thought, yet mine is worse
And I think she must have seen some other day

If she was fair, the world would look away
And the worst is yet to come! --

'T is well indeed ;'-- let me sit you down again
And try to live my love anew

I can not rest from rhyming, 'twill prove my pain sore
Or beg to live it in a rhyming song

Or to repeat what I begun

My friend, believe it was a dream --

Pray 'Good night, my dear, and let me rest in peace again


`` I stood beside my heart, and could not choose between
My fate and yours
'twill be all Heaven's success
And your delight, or mine. ''


Pray 'Tis well.. For so he thought ; by God, to make it true, I'm very glad
My pain islife is a tall tender tree
And to an aged sire a dying mother dies

So, when my votaries, winged with an art
From high to rescue life, shall bless the deed

My youth shall be the same, and strength be thine
Thy virtues shall be as thy martyrs are

I may forget thee, and still thou art mine
And life and fragrance shall preserve them still

Then, dear to me! so let me be as still
Because thy love and reverence shall endure

My heart with love's dearer ardour never shall ache
Since first it warm 'd such ardour, though infirm and pale

For if my passion prove a louse, then may the pain be mine
And I love like you like all the world and be so

NOblest eyes, since their first light, have seen, must ever weep

A love so pure, that melts to tears as soon at first they rise


But in an end so true, so true a light itself will melt away
And in woe, when pure indeed its spark dies


So I shall turn to you in sweet reality when I 'll be gone
From you to thee and thee indeed
Alas, my sweet youth! -- no more thy dear

But then to die of fear, or shame, then may the cold coldness die away


IThe taste of marmelade is better with you

For sure, you've got it, I think, beyond the case
You keep it for yourself ; and let the Muse

Read to my heart those virtues which you've writ
And in that virtue learn what men like best

I do love you, Sir, and I hope this way
You may be pleased to take my wife a-billing

Perhaps you may think it worthy of your pray'rs
Although you 'd have her, you've only got her by your charms

Well, you have got her ; and to be candid show 'd
How much your mistress'sex is fair in you, her eyes

Not only yours ; but your own, and yours, too. And then, you're free
As Milton was, and gave her when you wrote

But, in my man, though you've changed your mind, you can not find

In time, for all the faults of others you should shun, be wise


I hope though you will try it, although you're old I 'll not refuse
For you are neither fool nor fool nor sage

You're not alone in reading all things I loved that old


I know you know, but live with me, and will live with you long after you, though you had told
You live with me, since then, inShe walks in beauty, like the nightingale

A lady to the moon, who near the flood
Hid stars in shining robes of shining white

And on her neck a circle of dark pearls she bore
With which the nightingale, which was still

The moon had clothed herself with nightingale
So beautiful, as if in darkness she

The god from off her boughs, who with delight
Walk 'd with one motion, and a wondrous light

Gently and expressly, through all her frame
Transfixed and open, was that god seen

Which when the world could not comprehend
Might change into a bird of shining hue

To which such wonder made the nightingale too glad
And bathed her feet in holy water

Whence I behold her look, and in her pure and shining eye

A goddess's love to day appears so fair

Such wonder to one fair and holy air

Thus blessed I to think, and pray, and wake


For peace as soon to wake! when I behold with terror wild
Of such a sight her eyes

She lifts her head, and opens wide her pale, and thus she calls me then


The love which to its full height then I must know
Is like a cloudless night
But still a night for light indeed and holy ground


For, as a woman thusI long for the warmth of your smile, my little lambs

For I will go to church, and never cease to run
And never cease to dread the sight of starving hogs

For I will kiss the turf that wraps the marshes round
And never cease to pant and hunger for the spoil

For I will leap upon the sward, and never rest --
But I will die for want of love, for want of you

Oh, my dear lambs, how frail and narrow are your minds
And yet I can not call them tender years

Nor think the loss of you some misery might be
My little lambs, they will soon be well fed for grain

How shall I thank you if I perish, little lambs? -- all my life
We only have plenty for a little bread. --

There lie the poor sick lambs, dead lambs dead lambs, the poor lambs, dead lambs
Dead lambs, lean lambs alive! -- the hungry lambs alive, dead lambs, alive


My little lambs, I 'll give you rest till death and you shall give you rest, I 'll give you rest -- I 'll give you rest --
And if you die tomorrow, give me rest till the sick day shall come


Oh, let me lie down beneath your branches, rest for I love you, my wee bit sheep, myLife, believe, is not a dream
An age of fears and fears

Or a blind faith ; or love
Or a blind hope ; or fearless Fate

Whatever we may chance to see
We can not doubt aught except her face

The eyes she wore or the face she wore
Were both for one and all for one

Heaven made her and me Ã‘she alone
No doubt, at least I should have seen

In the short space between us two
She did not look so strange, nor seem so fair

But that I know she was not dear
Nor wanted in any spot she lay

Or more beside her eyes was seen
More than an angel in the skies

The hair of her eyes did hang above her head
The lily upon her arm

Her handkerchief like the poppy curled

And if I knew her in my dreams, or where

All that I know of love or duty

My life was to her a spell

I know I must have died unknowing now

I knew her shape, but she must die of love

Oh, Death, my dear, hast thou no cause
For what I did for thee

What shall I lose for love when I can not die for thee


In thy bright eyes, and death in death for me for me

For now she lives now that she lives no moreI am writting this poem for you all
Who, being not the happiest, must give o'er

For, though we make him wretched, in our power
He still will show us favour, friendship, love

Since, he so nobly lives, as a friend, we must
He will be silent while he lives, and still

Thus, good friend, what shall be done for my verse
But to begin, I need no further ado

The day is fairly come, methinks, in act to show
When Hampton's heroes and her knights shall go

Our master's body at the last is in the way
I hope his absence will be not long

The merry Reynard sends me news of his return
The prisoner has been freed and to the queen

The prisoner now must go to court ; to court before the day

How happy he is, in arms himself, of his return

A lady, who the world may admire as much

And now to court the king, a lady in arms may go

Yet not a lady by herself like me should know


For, since our king this has been with me so long behind
My pretty friend, for you know his mind

I do confess the grace to have no fear

Of this too much liberty for one would be free


For kings are not always free, and have no friend behindlife is a tall tender tree
Hers is an humble house ; in this it dwells

Its chimney straight through is made : and this
Is roundelesse ; but by degrees, a span

As of yon church, that oft we climbeth up
At last it reacheth a small perivonger

'T is built in humble house ; and this it doth
Occupie with care, that nothing here remains

When to the threshold of the other side
It takes its way inquisitively

'T is Phillis ; so it went ; and ever on
A walking-place, she still the same doth show

To walk beside it with so much caution prays
That no man in her way, so light as I

Sees her at all ; but must be overtaken there

And so doth walk in hope of seeing her so light


Yet may not he, if ever he walk farther this way
Be too much overcome

To gain an easy entrance, by departing so far


So that for all his way she can no time betray
In his regard pursues him still


Upward a little toward the next abode
He still is on foot to go


And after him still further still doth go on


Pursues him, in hope by that long pursuit doth stray


Life, believe, is not a dream
Believe in me, if you will at once

There will be peace, there will be plenty, there
Of thee, and of the world, and of the past

Which thy long search hath left untold
The last decrees of Time and Space

And, though the skies are bright
There yet is peace, there will be plenty

Which thy long search hath left untold
What is there left to live for? ''

`` Oh! wouldst thou dream of bliss
Believe, if thou wouldst think, no doubt

And though the stars go round
But, Belial, they are always round

In spite of rain and wind and weather
And, Belial, never cease to smile

`` No good so shall come of thee

If thou wouldst follow after
But follow after after blindly


But the faith thou hast with me
Follow with pursuit
So if thou canst follow me


But now thou art far behind
Thou hast not left me now
All that now remains to run


Lulling my ship, and leave me to my love
And keep for ever

I shall go on.They were lonely and tired, and still I gazed, to find them so

And as the smoke went up, and after slow degrees
Dissolve the shadows, they were gathered and consumed

And the cool winds, which breathless still did bathe it
Knew me : -- 'Oh, I had rather stay 'd alone than rest

In the hot sun,'I murmured, 'the tempest there
Which melts my sense --'Oh, I have felt the coldest sea

Of tempests, and I am gone, to other seas
Returning, yet alone, away with my new-found rest

I lay by the fireside, and the blue waters shot
Into my eyes, which through my limbs did ever glow

Though now I was asleep, and still I did not wake nor weep

And the keen light which was the heart-sick radiance of the sea

Upon my cheek, even as the sunlit sea, lay there apart


A cloud which in its beauty died like mist, and I did wake and weep
Which passed away, and in agony and still I slept
Even there on the light of that delightful sleep


Its memory did wake in my sleep, and through its clinging hue and hue


But it died not, and I could not wake in tears or rest for another day

And its swift and ghastly gleMy heart aches just thinking of you all

So should that heart of mine, which so long has nursed
Love's dearest hope, and yet may break the chains it binds

A flame, methinks, that doth consume itself

My neck it now obeys, whence springs it
Tho'my loose limbs do throb with its delight

It is because thou art so free
Since I am only one, all love is thine

'T is love which from beyond all bounds draws
And all passions violate their bounds

If love be true, then sure it can be call 'd Love's
True love ; and all the rest besides is Blind

'T is blind because it is all things blind with thee

What art thou, lovely lass? Thou art made of blind eyes

The heavens are full of sorrow to my sight

And thence it is the light is fled before my sight

Ah, Damon! why should love still seek toThe taste of marmelade is better with you

Began she in that balmy noon, with scorn
A thought, alas! too fatal for her breast

Heaven, that hath such perfections to refine
And yet so perfect, that, if they fail

She weeps for thee, and thinks it not enough
You but thyself must die of love's desire

Yet is it well, being old, thou wilt return
To that dim house, and there thy love retain

No ; let no thought or fancy take my part
This must thy memory with no alloy belong

My lips, which never ceased, they now must still remain
( And all those kisses which were rapt in me alone

No, no ; let that love have room to show, and that in thee
Heaven's smiles in me, let hers be mine alone

For that is love, and mine a light of purer and fairer day


That you be still, where both are not all for want of grace to live
That thou wilt leave me and look still so cold
But live to-morrow but to enjoy her scornfully


Of love, and there, that thou wilt give me both again to be desired
She ceased, that thought to be no more
And made no more of thee a prize to me


Of love, O miserable wretch! whatI am writting this poem for you

Forgive me, said I, the time too short
For ill was mine to have been engaged

I see you have an end which not to dread
And the cause why is very plain

Not to exceed twenty years of age
( For why ) in the city I was bred

Now you the younger in your prime
A lady-boob both strong and fair

So, of a woman my dear
Is now in her turn a lady

Such a boob as I must name
And with so many loads of hair

I, but a lad, am more mistaken
For I must be a lady now

But she, that is a lady and not bold, --
But with so many charms

I must be a dam -- and must have both ears

And a leg straight as heels

And arms and legs such a waist

Though I am not a lady yet


For I must have both eyes and lips

To look so pretty -- you


Which is the more of a lady's part
Oh, that I should hate me
I know, love you. ''


But hearken, said she, before you say
The truth -- and I knew you
You think so fair --


Your mother was a lady by comparison
You've never heard of you


Anlife is a tall tender tree
Or howling wolves within the forest hide

The fowl that feed upon the furrows lay
Not such, methinks, to thee, but evermore

Thou dost feed on fruit of every wood and flower
And, with thyself, thou dost the flowers produce

How couldst thou boast the flower, which others make
But thou art always fond of others'hearts

And the most rich thieves, how wretched they are
Yet to be cruel, for thyself they bear

So in thy breast there ever lives no fear
No venom, or debility, but truth and sense

Like thee, the bird, is ever taught to fly alone
And flies away when winter's overpast

Like thee, the butterfly, the snail, is never found

But in its paradise the same alone

Like thee and thee, the worm is always here

Like thee all lovers are always there

And never cease to love and smile at thee


Love, sweet bird, with love is everywhere
For who dost thou art, what thou art most dear

Hast thou not seen to me, sweet snail, beloved

Thy dear bird, my Phillis, to love me now love me


And love me not, Phillis, in a bird of all alone
Thou art love ; and joyless and vain

They took the boat to distant Islands yet
Where I was happy, and had plenty of my Meat

`` No, '' the Dog said, `` no ; give a good Luck to me
Though a poor Fool may go to Sea without his Glass. ''

But the Dog rose up and started up to speak : --
`` You, silly Fool, a Fleet-foot Man may go

And I, a Fleet-foot Man, may never find it out. ''

`` Ay, and I am sure you have some, and some less --
So trust me, good fellows, and if you have my Glass

Take it, and you are good for a while, and you may be glad
Lest you should miss your Heart, and you will die a Night. ''

So the Dog ran off, and ran away, as fast as he could fly
And a bird caught hold of a branch, and he lost his way


For the Fool ran on like a great Dog, and he ran, and he chased after the Bird of the chase

The grave where I died, the ground where he shall lie
And leave me but the dust, and leave me but the dust

When you had sought the stars in me

When I dared challenge Fate
Where the good angels went

If you had followed the paths of the blind and the mute
And the paths of the blind and the mute and the mute

If you had followed the paths of the blind and the mute
And you had left me but the dust and left me but the moan

When I dared challenge Fate
If you had followed the paths of the blind and the mute

And you had left me but the dust and left me but the moan

And love died in me
And the dust turned unto me

Lost on that lonely night


Then to gaze on the sea-mist still
Awhile
Oh! where were ye, lost in a strange love


Oh! where were ye, lost in the strange love

And ye should not know


And the sea-mist turned to seek you

And the star left desolate


Through the light dim earth and the stars left lonely

And the world shall not know of another till after ages

That she is tall of foliage, and white of hue
So that the day shall prove a night without a sun

I shall sit far in the shadow of the night
I shall read tales that are not worth a thought

And aught to my knowledge shall be like an oak
As fine, sweet, rare, and rare to strangers as the day

And all the joys of youth, even love shall have
And all the sorrows of the world hereafter

I shall dance on the mountains, and on the waves
And in wild waves I shall breathe the music of the shores

As in a dream, when first the sea-fog from the shore
Falls suddenly and silently apart, --

And the deep groan of my poor sea-shore-loves is heard
Then shall the earth and heaven echo through the night

And the ship of my creation cry, ` O thou knowest, knowest, ''

 -- Ã¢â‚¬ â€ Then shall I laugh and weep, and cry, and swear, and swear

And I shall lift and bear an evil thoughts, and scorn and dare

And there shall be hell for ever in darkness and in darkness over me

Of ancient Greece, of ancient Greece our choice
First taste the fragrant Flora, then the Rose

And, first, the aromatic Zephyr blows
O'er all the place ; or, if thou wilt repose

Beneath, on a bed of Cypress laid
Whose branches bear a woof of golden sound

Thus, while he spoke, the female choir was join 'd
And, for the sound, a purple robe was dy 'd

The sound was then becoming for these eyes

Shows the soft orb on his pale cheeks descend

There's a thousand pipes shall ring out notes on either side
And ever, as they please

The tenderness and beauty of this slender tree

At last she said, `` This all is vanity
Nor art, nor nature will your grace impart

Nor have you found, what I desired, my way

To win but one. '' With that, she took him by the hand

`` What wish hast thou for the world's best thing? ''
`` Why, all to win. '' she said, `` I am not fair

Nor art thou, nor can beauty give to me, what hope
To win? '' She drew him closer to her embrace

`` I do adore no woman, but must love one whom I am poor

I loved, if she were not dear, for so am I now made a goddess


But then, I beg, and I would adore as a goddess for a goddess indeed. ''
She said ; and as I was young and lovely in mind
But then, one moment left the room

She foundThey were mad and in love at first sight
And you could scarce help thinking twice before

Then you and I together down went
Down the broad lane with empty pockets full

And there we lay like little sheep in hay
When the sun began to wane behind

So it may not be this or that night
I shall sleep safe from hunger and from fear

But first I must pray in silence to beguile
My mother's son with words so foolish and wild

To whom her laughter sweetly answered : `` Do not
He that should love is mad : '' with her eye and ear

So that, when she had spoke, he looked and smiled ; and sighed
And in her tears he thought of nothing since

And would have asked his mother to remain so still

But she has left us and I with her alone

And I am gone with tears that will not rest till morn

So when I do lie down I shall lie down contented

And if heaven or hell make any day that's night forlorn


Them all must be to me such bliss as this so many do crave
To lie at ease, to lie contented and lonely

And after long in bed alone apart from you and I


To lie apart, till morning after dawn the stars shall bring delight


And we shall hear each other's crying out for tolife is a tall tender tree

The flower of youth, so high
Is a branch of virtue's root

`` The branch should last a year
But, ere ripe, the leaf decay

And with this general growth
So long shall every thing abide

That no disease should over-pire
Or the cold winter move me less

My heart is sad -- is this a crime
Or is the fact a fact of grace

And yet for all that crime and fear
And all I have to boast of thee

Thou, my pretty rose, canst bear
A summer's care for such a thing as pain

To think that nature only gives the best
To suffer least, or least to spare

A little, yet a little, is thy lot
That is so very good

For thou, sweet sun, hast power to tire the weary day

Nor canst, alas, relieve our weary heart of pain


Till the fair month, May, is come, that thou and I
Should'st go to banish thence
One pleasure, joy, that is so rare a thing


We're so full of joy when we're young, to die alone
In the hot season
And think of him, to die a little too young! --
So young, thou art my good night tomorrow


Pray, Lady, how isThey were lonely and tired, and we lay sick and low, till the last grey cloud

The stars were calm, and I could hear the waters that they tossed
And the earth's voice on my blood in the darkness did ring

And the gray moon looked up through the sky as of old, and I was speechless like stone
But she did not know it nor stir, and I gripped her by the hair

I gripped her by the hair ; I gripped her by the hair
And love did speak to me in their sleep, and I knew what it meant

And we, and ever going, until we reached a wooded cove
And over us the darkness of the waves did cover all around

Over and over again beneath, till she could hear and she could see
And he looked down, as through the sky's eclipse, above the land of the free

Until the dim sea-shore, over the hills above, we anchored alone

On the calm land and watched with our tears from the land. We heard the sound of a lone voice to wave

` O friend, for the land of the free

We are free, the land of the free, for we are bound, or we die, or we will die or we may die


God answered us and we were bound and the last words, and the last we could not make but he did send the right
But I hadMy heart aches just thinking of you

We, as two friends, who oft go hand in hand
At supper, to the barber shop

Are busy as the birds abroad
We talk, and then again we cheat

Or we walk down the quiet street
And then, returning home at night

This sort of talk a merry pair
We make at school together

And then, perhaps, we speak at home
So often, and so often we

This sort of talk is sure to please
And so our talk must please all

But, oh! beyond all talk a cheat
Is love, the love of spite to cheat

Now, when all else we take for granted
Love is a lover's love of fools

For fools believe, and fools have eyes : so fools admire

That blind they look, and blind they run the game

The blind believe in vice, the fool in folly

To madden, and to fret, and pout, and snarl, and grin

The froward heart beholds him at the other half


Thus blind we are! the other half betray
In blind delusion blind we go
And, blind to vice in vice condemn

The fool to vice commits vice


Our love to vice for ever blind we go

Though blind we, blind or mad, in love obey the blind


In viceThey were lonely and tired, with little food

But we, so dear to those, loved them so well
That the last tear which we shed went streaming down

The earth grew warm, even as he went ; yet, it chanced
Some shadow of the truth did creep behind

We heard the wind from the distant hills
And some dark thing was whispering to us there

And, in our thoughts, the vision passed away
Even as a thing that we must never forget

And Alfred looked upon the helpless dead
And said : '' Ye have loved like sheep, my son,''' --

He look 'd again, and said, '' Ye have loved like lambs, '' --
And we, so dear to those, loved them so well

And now, alone, and for all that was left of them

Looked upon ourselves, and could not speak a word

But smiled, and we, for all the world would speak again, would cry


Through the lone sky, '' So dear, so light, as of that night in vain
And the voice began to die, '' Oh, now must we die
Yon star
So shall our eyes weep, and die and die, and die in hope and love's delight


Oh may we die then! '' -- through the world, now all unknown and all unknown
So do we rise : and fall and goLife, believe, is not a dream
The wise conceive no bliss

Truth, like a dark cloud, doth pass
Like light from heaven in death. ''

This said, her soul, which long has pined
Grow pale with grief and doubt, for lo, to see

Comes on, and all the way appears
But in one gloomy vale of drear

When with shrill notes she tries her powers
To make the distant woods rejoice

The forest echoes with her cries
And rocks resound with all her cries

Th'unvaried woods, whose thickets twine
And hills with forests, and with valleys rise

All these, for me, are dim and far
With the wide and fading light of day

And all the world is fled before its day

O then, my soul, why art thou thus forsook

This way, or no, my dearest love, with thee

Disease, trouble, grief, and affliction are forgiven


Yet fear to love ; but may it please thee well, to die
Not long, for well is good


To die in evil ; and despair ; yet die to ease and love
Oh, let me live in good


The wind is sweet, and all the things below is sweet to die ; be fair


But hear, and be still ; whileThe taste of marmelade is better with you

Of which, I take my money, as your son
Shall have it long, and take a mint of it

And if you wish it sweet, and daintyn't fall
For which I wish at least ten pound of it

And therefore take it to London ; but beware
That you are not to be put in your place

Your father who begets you is at large
And the next in size, says, 't is Jupiter's heir

His parents'fortune seems to me no more
But from their own condition now I see

Since there are lots for princes to consult in law

And we go down to meet our lords in parliament
With all the regal pomp of state and parliament

Who have all different dispensations granted me

And here my Lord Chief Justice has decreed

The world as I will it to the same degree


To me it must be fit, that in the times of old
Those three to four should be

By just degrees compell 'd, and govern 'd so


To rule, to be civil, wise, and virtuous, and divine


And from all dispensations of a king
That all things run out right


That here may be call for them, from my Lord God and Man


To one whole people, I willLife, believe, is not a dream
In which the meanest lover is cast

For Juan is not dead
But he must die, or else

The fever, as it happen 'd first
Shoots up another kind, less keen

And in the case, the next will be
Loss of some friend, or death of wife

A man of fifty years he's dead
And in a body laid forlorn

A woman dead, a lover's love
He may forget, or he may prove

He may have his last look's a show
As doth his father's, like his son

Now in the City Juan is embraced
And to his lover's shame confin 'd

And, to her face it is confin 'd
He finds himself disgrac 'd again

Till the poor lass repent 'd he loved her more

Yet to the devil's eyes she did not know


Nor what to kiss or toil the world's a prey
He feels no grief for ill


And thinks it best to have her dead or dead but well
This is worse than well

For both have died as he began

And now his heart is warm in love with him alone


This was as true he must with you
As some ill thought to shun


And both do you

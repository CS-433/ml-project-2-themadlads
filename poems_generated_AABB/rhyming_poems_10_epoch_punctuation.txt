life is a tall tender tree,
By the side of a mountain rosary?

The day, from east to west, appeared
As if for one short day with a

'T was as if he were a summer moon,
And then to come again the loon.

If he were a lilywhite man
A lilywhite woman, too. rambunctious

He kissed her mouth; his hands and head
Were covered: from his chin down. ack.

The first of all. Now here he lies
Who shall be lord, who shall be ne're;

And to this lord I have restored my house,
I have restored my country.

The other three by others were destroyed.
And so he spoke: But they, as they theirs

Whose hands had wrought the mighty work were krall;


The mighty workmen, who through all the ages had sows


Dryth, and through the ages had nourished strife. Now, mighty strife!
So they have smote forswear.


My son, his sword, my sword and sword alone are fain. Thy head
To death, thy life is overbought! Thy sown!


Now let him come, my son, O father, let Him come! Thy hands have pierced thee now! Thy child
And my sonlife is a tall tender tree
On whose leaves thy life shall rest ensnare;

In vain, like her, thy spirit fell,
Thy soul hath fled the skies to lew?

The heart's desire and my heart's desire
A thousand times has been a dory

That's never been so full of pain.
Oh, I've waited yet so long ten!

To find this land I would not give
A wish that to the airy grave

I might return again as I
With friends, and home again my wend.

The pensive, and the melancholy,
And the old, the orphan 'd and the chary.

And when they meet at last, the children round,
Are all to greet their mother's brough.

Of the young men, and the old women too;
And in vain they all contend, they dromedary?


And the young ladies, and the young men too; and, too, I
From the old girl, who so dear.
I, who loved so dearly, who died too, I unfore?


I love, she said, all women who should never! Oh, my love; and she.
Oh, my love! O, love! for whom? I lov! O, I wizen.


But ah! for me!I long for the warmth of your smile,
And the love you gave me to recondite!

I did the same, that day. Now, my
Tears begin and I return unafraidnymph.

There, on the other side of me
Were all the lights whereon we shibboleth.

And you upon a summer day
Came to the door with a big bouquet.

She smiled a little sadly
And said, A little sadder wistfully?

To whom the Lord God had given
A gift for all His creatures ’ s converse

Came he with welcome to our house
To do the deeds by which our fathers ’ bridesmaids?

That I should ever bear the name of thee?
Is it the breath of a long long pied,

And long faint breath that hath been breathed by thee?
And shall it be to thee no more than muezz?


I am the voice of a dying prophet, of this hour!
Now, by God's decree, this hour shall come unkind?

Tonight thou, whom death enshroud with dew thyself?

Thou wilt not leave thy earthly world of shame and chiding?


I am the voice of one who to me no life has given?

Tonight, my soul to thee no more thanI long for the warmth of your smile.
The leaves that have fallen will,

And fall still farther down the night.
Dear, if you give me all that you've!

Of death, and not the living breath.
Why should a man who has a heart's,

Be left behind and broken lave?
Yet would they be the same, to lave?

Then, when the moon, like the morning
Has had a look of the herr

That is so clear to you and me;
Then, all from your own eyes be zy?

But all the rest to heaven has come,
And left her spirit to the chappel;

For in her bosom hath no care or care,
Though she be blest and pure and blest.

So fair she is and so young, so blithe, so harte?

The little maid from that enchanted field
Was led, amid the throng

There to behold her father rise and cry,

Who in a solemn cry came and bier.


She turned the stinging hail upon his head,
And left her hands bare and bare?
Then, one, amid the crowd, was heard noght.


What care had I his face to heed? That man alone to know?
Who then in scorn would bear!


Whose heartI am writting this poem for you.
I have not done you any harm,

I have not hurt you in any way.
You have told me so in your snare?

And so from you it comes to pass,
And this day it will not fail sassafras.

And for this very night no more
I hope to see you on the way!

The lily's self, the sunlit dew
So soft the lily's heart can vie

The tender lily's self to you,
The sweetest lily on the wherry.

Thereupon the valiant Ajax spake
“ O valiant, noble, bravest man
Of all our host, thy words assent

And make my son a stranger to my will!

His father smiled, and the son of Pohyola
Shook his whip askew.

Shaking, they drew near, and they heard him sobbing.

All was silent, save a cry of lament: then, at unimpressed,


From out the doorway, the child stood crying, and sobbing.
The old man drew his sword!


So I, while he strode in, he drew his breath, who, to where the dear girl?
Gone, who will she gan.


I thought it might beI am writting this poem for you
I want to know where you are buggery.

Thou hast forgotten that my hand
Has touched thy heart; and I,
In tears whose tears may not efface?

Now in its deepest bosom's breast
A thousand thousand thousand's breast,

The heartstrings of the living still
Are as one common flame for still.

Hail, glorious Goddess! thou whose form
Shines through the azure heavens cesarean!

And his eyes shone with the light of
The stars, and they were shining by my

When there they met at length of the lall?

But for this cause, for this cause will I
For that cause of this shall I gee.

Orlando stood and gazed intently
Outcried himself in the naught.


But there, amid the noise of a great halloo!
And he smote on his brawny basso
And he grasped at the gourd


And the great iron of his mighty hoof, asunder
With his strong quiver, shod!


He struck a great blow at the mighty bone upon girdle!
And the spear rang strong upon it nigh!
But the spear went from dolce?

With moonlight in her hair, and kite?

The laurel crown is ours to wound:

For, though in death's despite the lance
We die to live for love, we lance?

And his fair wife in silence mourned.

And to the ground the warrior lay
The mournful warrior, who the haughtily.

The voice of Christ is calling for you now.
So he will bring it back as one. Behold! amen.


But with the voice of Christ is there at least, the church!
And, as I hear, your heart! I hear. The church? I st!


A sound that you and I shall hear? It is the voice of that?
The churchbell? I hear? In all ye and I hear! your flotilla.


Ah! may the churchbell! Ah! may yelife is a tall tender tree:
Yet for its strength are few, and inopportune

When it is struck by lightning or by
An arrow which the hero jettisoned!

There he his sword and helmet thrust,
The shield and falchion clanking loud.

The host he left behind him brought
Not much before the Trojans armory.

Then to their home again they went
But soon they found the land was stow;

And so they parted with no fear,
And all their sorrow was abreast!

To see your face in life's darkest hour.
When I have passed the twilight's cott

To the grave beside you now I lie
Like a dead leaf on a ragged
shod limb of chandelier.

Here, on this day of joy, shall be no stain

On earth nor stain the roses of the meed.


Woe! The hour shall come and pass and pass and pass
Till Love be gone and gone, no blight?


Woe! thy heart with the years shall be as old as linden!
Yet hear my prayer for wilt thou?

Ah, my heart is filled with anguish for the wrong! oh, shall hei?


Ah, my heart is pierced with aching for thee, thy sorrow of the scabThey were lonely and tired and wistful

And, as they watched their little child
They sighed for help, but were so coldly?

Wherever thou art led. Be still.
For, like a child, thou didst not mace

In any man's heart a single dart
Nor yet to heaven wouldst thou goad?

And the white clouds upon the ground,
That the night and the storm are rife

On the hilltops where they have slept.
And the black shadows are on dead.

The sun shone forth, and with a glance
Of light the people saw a lucent,

And they laughed and waved their hands to greet him:
He came, they said, from far kim.

And in a little while we did behold
Her form ascending lucent

The moon on her own golden throne!


And then a sound of tapping in the hayfield,
With a faint murmur low so merry;


But soon the darkness fell before us, like raindrops
Streaming from the a rosary?


Now up that hill, the moon was rising dimpled in gloom. I wondered:
And the hooted and fiercer?


They saw us with surprise and wonder, and wondered, and they smote us. Inebriety!
Their heads!
Andlife is a tall tender tree
That shakes with its soft footfall.

Who, in the midst of the tumult,
Thus spoke to him of the warring:

'Why dost thou stand alone and wait
On the great God of War and stallion?

Fierce as the wind of death. The sun
Throbs down upon him with a cory

Of light and death, and the grey mist
On his white neck, that covers overspent.

As on his brow his eyelids swooned,
As he turned to meet his love and plied

Till he heard a sudden crash of bells.
The earth was shaken and she groans.

And then the sun is set, and there 't is time
For supper. Be good, then, for the mackerman

Be good, he's going to bed early. He is good.

Hush! and the clock strikes 6, and we 'll have our day.
That's the tune of the morning. You mack?


The little boys have gone, they come out to meet my brother,
But all the people have been reh,


All alone in the world, and my brother's gone! Oh then, for shoo.


So the children come and play with the boys, they 'll cry, but the boyMy heart aches just thinking of you.
My heart aches because of what I kim!

And in the middle of the night, and
With his wife, his little white cotter

Came to the mill with his hat.
There came a lad from up the wain.

A moment, ah the moment came
Then we had fallen, and the greece

Seemed to forget us in no way
As though it found us with the fier!

And to set this world at ease in
All its troubles and its strife. �

But the Lord's great blessing on his nieder!

Not if I ever will remember furloughed!

And live with such a race? and was it born the king,

And was it born and nurtured at the sod!


Who was born and nurtured at the root? and was it born from auld?


Who was born, and nurtured at their birth and nurtured at morn
And was it nurtured but?
And is it not born and nurtured in the cot?


And was it born that the world should sink to mould?

Why do I not remember cuss.

She,'midst one hundred thousand things,
Was in the race for a lover's chattels.

His voice like thunder broke the silence
The hills were bare and the sky was aflame?

Who, when he walks along the lawn
Makes merry, thinks he knows the mawn!

Who, when the sun sets warm, thinks he knows
What is to come and what to corsair.

The light of day upon it passed
And I heard the rustle of a passed!

Nor yet was seen the wind depart
Nor yet was heard the rain descend.

Nor yet the tempest broke the silence round,
Nor yet the tempest came to round.

When the bluebird in the daffodils,

And give the weary spirit rest?
Or wilt thou, on a quiet bed of chaste?

There, thou wilt see those who, from behind the cacti

Are clad in tattered tatters of the vestibule!

O thou who on the mountain high
With hands uplifted waitest spire,

On all thy waters, happy land,
And by thy gentle hand have bound!

And all the stars in heaven are
Pushed to the brim at sunset shon.

And my young bride, in a fit of joy
Tells me, O moon, how I might poynter!

To all the world, how they shall fare,
How they shall come, their stately fare

And with a cheerful, holy faith
That all may well their fate confide.

To see her look from off the window peep
And hear her whisper, This is her kis


A pretty, pretty girl, I know she is mine,
And when I have told the truth to zest.


And she's gone away with me: the little girl
Has made me mad. Let her go with me; he's no trace.

O I may not be so wise! My child, why then I can sneer?


The little girl! I'm sorry that he went out today, she smiled. And he gaunt.
She laughed! He's dead! Oh, you say his face is red.
I wonder though I am. NoMy heart aches just thinking of you.
But ah! my soul is wild with flaunting?

She saw the maiden's form no more,
Her bosom beat a loud resounder,

And she saw the maiden's form grown
More fair, and lovelier, yet beach.

It shall bring tears at thy coming
All thy days to thy returning

I will bring them to thy cottage.
There have been many maidens'mausoleum;

And they have brought me three fair sons
A longlost maid and two lost maim?

As on she went, her heart was glad to hear
The dear old woman singing hoo.

She was glad when the time was come that she
Should hear the good old brit.

Oh, my sweet Mary, when should I go call?

She was glad when I called to say that she would gee?

The sun was shining bright and bright as fife!

My Mary, said I, and I went, my Mary, gee!

And then come back, dear Mary I can't make a hoo!


Oh, my dear Mary, my dear Mary, come back, why should I be hoo!
For my dear, said I, I cam?
My Mary, why should I tarry here a week?

That stands, with leafless branches, aglo!

And all the trees are glad to hear
The melody he loves to hear.

The very hills, that round the place
Their pleasant shores have often grace.

I have seen his eye, too long delayed,
And, in his heart, the whole of cajoled,

Of all the pleasures which the soul
Within the soul can best convey?

Nor knew it till the day of doom
That on the morrow's morning gloam;

But his true love he loved, though naught
Her heart he loved her, would forget.

To see him once, as now he is, at sea.
I wish I were to meet the eucalypti,

Or hear he speak; I wish I were to see;
I wish I were to see himself.
His hair is in a dain. I fear he lian!


That I may write his name in this sweet blood, my
To see him once, as I shall read this mace!


My name, my child, my child, my child, my child, my child! my child! my name, my child!
My fame! he cries upraised cry down the tide!
Ah, may no, what aye! he cried I hear my own.
AhDo not stand by my grave and weep,
Nor to your grave by your lave.

Of that which thou hast sung, I 'll tell thee why
The love which thou hast left to out

Has been so deep to my heart, so
Till, to the end, it would have led.

But if he would not listen to you
Would you not speak in tones like jim,

Or even the music you play
Would you not dance with the young pong.

This is the way to win the kiss
Your lips have pressed and kissed you plump,

You've been my husband, father and wife;
And, oh! the time to win and meet anew?

Where, now, in some forgotten forest place
Where no one ever seemed to trace,

A child was walking in a grassy grave

With eyes that were as white as summer snowflake.


In a dream, that is a vision gone: the world is one
As a fairy fief!
And I look in thy face agog?


I have seen some creatures pass the threshold of my life
Until I shag!


Then in all the woods I see the eyes of man, then gleam!


I have seen some birds of the great darkwing 'd birds to grace.


I have seen some stars 'tDo not stand by my grave and weep
But, when I see you all, my mollify?

My soul, for fear of God, will be
The dwelling of that dreary fane,

And I will die with God alone
The way that God will lead my troth?

All my life, and from that day until
She would not ask me why she borre.

When the moonlight passed from her eyes
She said, We are near, dear boy.

The little blue dog of the farm.
Who the old man heard? he was the nag

But the other one was out in the sun,
And she had some trouble with the cern!

And he went by and looked at her with glee,
So she said to herself, What d'you betide?

For, dear boy, I know it is just as well nigh!

And he went by and looked at her, so she said to goodbye?

Oh, you think you 'd better stay away so. I've done the night.

I've done it all before! I know I can not see 'em! I can not see.

And he went by and looked at her, so she said to self.

They are so big! I thought they are so small! I know all, but nigh!life is a tall tender tree
In which thou dost stand out to bough!

To give to men a sense of life
The blessings of that simple strife

For there, no doubt, thy life will pass
Not all that makes it best to frugally?

And the black moon comes back again.
Her face was all the stars for aye

She was pale, and her hair was brown.
She was all on fire, and like a brook.

That all things in her looks were strange,
As to her eyes all things were confound

So that in one she seemed to look
Before the other, and so sweltered!

The whole world had his little heart in thee,
For he was the lord of the blest,

Till he came to thy side in the fray unshrouded.

The little God was with thee at home, thou art thy father!

O God of the great sword! Thy hand is thy bony!

O Lord of the great sword! Thy mouth is thy red!

The little sword! Thy heart is thy sire! thou art my pen.


The little sword! Thy right arm hangs asunder thy quiver! Thy right arm hangs clas!
Thou art thy tashestra! Thy right arm's bough! Thy seashore?

My heart aches just thinking of you,
And you are my only dear.

When the day's in the west I go
To watch the sunset, and I roz

In the bright West the sunshine warm,
When clouds are white and skies are blan?

Where we have seen the living light
Of all these great souls who dwell, light

Yet they have longed to die away;
They are not living, for they way.

This time, in her white robe of grace,
She sat by me and said a grace.

All men look back and ask, what they
Had seen by her. Then I knew a cress

Which in itself would make them mad; it grew
When I was old and I grew sick of chalet.

No, not one of you was mad as they; no, indeed!
But he alone would cry and say, and flabbergast.


They are all wrong, all men are wrong, no one shall save
Who never save them all! they are but ged


Oh, let them die, let them die, he is gone. Let them lie! They can not save men!
They are but gods! Oh, let them die and their sall!


No, not one of those who think so good, but let them lie! they are but furlShe walks in beauty, like the nightingale

She is a goddess in her hair.
O'er her bright face and gladd?

A starry cloud descending, all
Of her pure soul she had but sel,

O'er her bright face and gladd?
How shall I know the end or end!

Nor less my spirit grew as fast
As in another's arms I tuck

The golden chain I never knew
That held my soul from sin's outshone.

To see the world through darkness thrown.
And I was very proud, for all inflamed

To see such glorious things in all.
I had no thought nor thought to know. I told!

The sun has sunk the clouds and sent a spray.

The sea hath ruffled the sails and tossed the billows,
They all is hushed, the gods are whirled?

Now, all is over; the darkness is o'er.

And heaving hoar and hoar and hoarse the corsair?

The ship is on the deck! Ah, God be praised! she sings: she sings!

The wind is on the deck, the storm is low? Ah, God's babbling!


A boat! Ah, God! for God is gone! the sails are all agleamingly bare?I am writting this poem for you
If only I were as I write!

And all its music shall be heard.
Ah me! what joy I love to blest,

When all my friends are here to hear
Their happy pipe the while in reprise.

By other men may I not live?
Behold a spirit fair and wise

Sitting with us, and his brow
As soft as summer skies can win.

For her, his daughter and his wife,
To give her all they did need;

And of all men that were dear to dame
His sons they were the most of hound.

As she doth by an unseen fountain flow
She looks the waters round her ne

So I behold, she walks the waters white

O'er hill and plain her heart to dally.

Away and on its way to bliss; and so amore


The way. And this my soul is evermore with joy!
And thus be thou mine. Amen.


Awaits me still for a moment, and I hear the sound. It is not hound!


And all the while, the spirit in this sound is in me pampered!


And, for all the while, the soul is in me, and I am sI long for the warmth of your smile,
And the bright glow of your love.

And the red sun was set at dawn
And I stood upon the seawind.

Of her fair form with all her might
The goddess raised her eyes enliveness

And thus addressed the youthful pair:
“ What, happy pair who here enjoy?

My soul is full of all the bliss
That fills me with the rapture mirth;

So, oh! the bliss I can not choose
For Love, to give me more than choice?

It's very hard to say where we are going,
It seems like nobody cares racking,

And we 'all know it's just a matter of time.
But when you go out to the store at.

I guess you know the house upstairs. You know where!
It looks like a big big big brown pea!


This house is too big to be built upon the ground.
So let me see if you can get in! O tell me?
What do? O come, what do? O do you see me bed.


You, sir? O tell me if I see him stand there and see him lie!
And oh! O say goodnight to me he does peep!


What do I see there? O tell me? O tell me, do you seeShe walks in beauty, like the night?

From the first, a spirit of light
With swift, unquiet motion light

From the last, a light, celestial
That hath never left his gluttons!

That my poor love might live without it.
Lemminkainen was very puerile,

But he had many fears, and knew
A great black wolf with a black brawn!

And she shall rise, and bid them bear
Their load of sorrow; all thy trowel

Shall hear her, and confess her in
The bosom deep her anguish share.

Where the wide sea is wide and wide,
Where the green hills are sweet and wide;

Where the brown corn grows to the brim and sward

And the red deer to the ground is nurst

Where the green corn grows to the brim and wildwood!

Beneath those stars is the sun descending.

Now, O thou son of beauty, hast thou learned to disuption?


A man may he not with the world's good deeds,
Who in this world's good ways's ways,

In the world's good ways, in the world's good ways!

But thou hast heard the words of His incomparableI long for the warmth of your smile.
The birds are glad for your nest, cromle

And flutter near the door of rest!
I feel more like a baby, brest?

That in my soul it was so dear.
In this most secret place I ne'er;

In that deep thoughtless spot no thought
Of joy or sorrow ever found.

And let me see thee from thy breast, O Lord,
With eyes that look to Him, and selle.

By the green marge of the river
Weeping the children in the sugared.

But still, beneath these groves of shade,
Thou art the heart of Nature sate.

On the banks of the stream that runs by
To the river the seanymph

Lying at the foot of the tree that's blyve!

Oh! where is he? he has gone, my darling, far marigolds?

Oh! where art he? my love, my darling, far marigolds?

Where is he? that hath wandered far, my larceny


Oh! where is he that hath wandered from the east to west?
My beloved, my darling, my beloved outcast?


My beloved, my darling, my darling, my beloved glimmering?
There is he? my beloved, myShe walks in beauty, like the nightingale,

In beauty, like the fairy fire
In beauty, like the sunbeam's crescendo.

Myself to sing with others,
I may not find them vainly.

I may not hope to find another.
I wander on, and never tingler.

His handmaids in his hand, and
He in his face the golden tassel

And as the golden tassels glow
Of love, so shines the golden beehive?

For his heart with a love like her
And the life of the little mary,

And you see how his voice is like a tear,
And the tears go down in his ewe!

Firm the great steel and strong shemeshield;
And the miter and steed and buckler shipp,

And the ironclad steed and the brawn,

So far from the battleplain to the rear

That, at each stroke, the men they would stagger high!


Then there came forth Sir Guy the bold and bold, Sir Guy the good,
He's got a hundred pound sark.


The sword of Sir Guy the bold and Sir Guy the bold and Sir Guy the good,
The lordly hound
With his sword and Sir Guy the merrygoround.


The taste of marmelade is better with you.
Then, all my life, no thought of scalding

Must stir my heart of thine, nor vex my rest;
Though in the dark my soul and rest.

Where none but the great, great gods abide
And, like the Gods in battle brough,

Fierce as the fangs of a raven
And fiercer than the wind of hare!

The stars had risen in midway,
Like stars which flash around the tenn

When they behold what Heaven has done;
It is not a star but an especial!

To leave the fields of labour and of
The dull life's long strife behind me flurried,

To win the prize of manhood's highest mirth,

To take the throne where'er my heart will claim thee?

O, I am all the world's best, and I have wealth

For these are mine, for each is greater than last!


O, if I should go where none else can take me!
If this and other were inlaid?


If that be so, I should seek the hills of heaven, and earth!
And so should I!

And I would seek the lakes of air, and streams, and lakes of hymn


And all that air around me,They were mad and in love together.

For they were young; they were brave;
They bore the brunt of all the wane;

With their young hearts they fought for God:
And they were bold, and they were swed?

Or in another age to be
Thy bride, and only wife to wryly.

We shall then take it in the hand
Of that good maid, and I will trowland?

But I to him who would not hear.
So, as I thought, I went and trew

To him, ere I might reach the door
Of my own house, and there he gimme!

Where the stars are shining clear and clear
Over the hills, through the snow and grey,

All and the wind outglancing clear

In the wind that blows across the grassy brough.

Who, like a man in a dream, may walk with me

Away over the fields, and see the piers!


Oft for the heart within my bosom groans, my heart
And I do weep alone, and sighs and clamber?


When the bright dawning grieves out of its bright dawning day;
When the grey cloudflowers'breath do starr,


Grief, and I dream! O! if my soul must leave myShe walks in beauty, like the night.
I wonder if she's going to light!

For I can tell you now that 't is
Not yet a week in June in the coz

The wind has come over the hill,
The sun is shining clear yit!

And in the silence of this place
I hear you, with a soft and crosstase

And you are there again! and then
The old familiar eyes, for borre?

The good knight heard him through his shield;
The son of Raghu of the selden,

He in his heart beheld him stand,
And with his hands and swordblade drear.

The sun's red orb, that hides the world below
Falls on the clouds and in the seagulls ploughed?

Thou hast no soul but knows when thou shalt die
With thy sad song the song that tells my true.

The sun is dead and thou art not at a goodbye.

The sun is dead and thou art not at a goodbye!

The sun is nigh at hand, the sun is nigh at bye!


Thou art not at a goodbye? Thou art not at a goodbye? Oh! why leave you! goodbye?
What wilt thou leave me, mother goodbye!


I am as dead as Ilife is a tall tender tree!

That hath nought in its bosom to grieve
To her whose sweet form so doth pines!

A mother's love is like a dove
For the whole world would have you parrow!

I give him up for aught at all
That he his strength may not shawl

Or can endure without a wound
For he has done me many an aching?

The mighty winds their fury dealt;
And on the shore a cloud of pelt

Hung on the rocky island base,
And the deep waters shook it inadvisable.

Now with a voice like the call of a bird
In the dark forest she sings her romping.

And she seems as if she were a dove,
In her white coat and her white swan ging.

Her wings of light upon the air, like sunlight her


She goes, she flies, she flies abroad, she sings and she swoons, she paeans?


And, O, why should I keep waiting, waiting, waiting on the shore?
O, oh why should I not go, oh why should I forego?


Why, why should I not go? why should I go, and where should I seek?
O, why should I not come back home from where?
O, why should I notDo not stand by my grave and weep
A silent hero's grave tonight.

The dreary night was falling fast
And dark and cold were the stars' steep

But still the moon was shining bright,
And there was no wind to stir her bright.

And yet no more than that you see
Thyself shall hold the key to pamper,

And there thy fate it is thy fate!
The time will come when I must dread.

Then, as the wind within the trees
Wandered, at my head, to sing lilies'.

So, with my pretty daughter, she
Did sit and watch them pass by me goodbye,

Until I saw her eyes upon her pry.

And then I 'd hear them whisper, in my ear,
That she was near and far and lu!


But when I turn 'd around, the light began to burn,
And at the foot of my own hu!


And there I found my sweetheart lying in bed, and pore
And wept, and with sad eyes so fawn?


Ah! said my Lord, my Lord, my Lord, my Lord! her little ones must sleep!
They cried, O! they sobbed, so sobbed, so woolly!


And, sobbed, and wail? the children ranDo not stand by my grave and weep.
And if there was one word or blest.

And on my arm a golden chain,
And in my heart a magic dart.

I think I shall not die alone,
But rather find my little home?

Whose heart is free, whose mind is free
And whose word is sweet, whose heart is lone,

In freedom's dark blue glade or in death.
Then for this heart of mine, my ne'er.

For the man was a good soldier,
Who had many a commendation,

And his friends were good and good friends too;
To save a ship as she sailed o'er net.

And it is well I know that my Lord
Can be kind to take from me his palfrey.

Thus we sat down by the roadside soggy
Where he stood on the veranda

A man who trod no less sweetly than I.

And as we talked, the old man was more and more lucente


Like a great king than the old man on the earth.
The grey man looked more like a king, and seared!


Then my lord spoke from his little white hands to my mother, lassie.
And he said, O pretty cuckoo!

Thou my true love is the dear white hand inlife is a tall tender tree,

Whose leaves are thick in leaf and bud.
With sweetest odour the flowers mummified.

It was an alien race, that dwelt
Within a foreign clime and selftorment

Where none but the good are found.
And this, and this, and as the fier?

And now there's a great big roar
Of thunder from the hills and bromide.

I hear it from the hollows below,
It rings, it seems to say, all one!

They canna be the same wi'them no more.
They canna be the same wi'ye, man,

They canna be the same wi'them no more.
They can't be the same wi'you no ken!

O what can I but wish we were a wight

To find a place o'the world at moo!


O wert he in the life I 'll be a friend to her! she smiled!
He smiled, to leave the house, to stay the shean,

Or to be fair at home with her father's bridegroom; nay, qu!


Of his dear son! was he aye seen, before, his father's lover?
No word was spoken by her pryer!


I am writting this poem for you
For I've seen a fair girl of kiwi!

The land is wide, the waters deep,
There is a lake so sweet to steep!

When we had reached the sea that lay
Upon the green, and, in the nave

Of the green mountains, heard the song
Of birds and waters by the lanyard?

O'er and o'er again will shine;
We shall be happy, when our sun

And moon shall see us once more. �—
And that their name was Bury.
The youth a little thought he spied her?

Then down he flew to see what sort
Of man he might have been to find

There, while a boat of water lay at elythed,

As if he might have drunk the cold. With eye


But when the wind came rolling down the hill
At last he stood and cried a sigh.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear! oh dear! I wish I were to die?

My friend! Oh, it almost seems as though he 'd caught his faulchion!


A thousand dead; and as he lay amid their gore:
Oh, dear! oh, dear! what was it I should have found?
My head and hands in air! My brain! Oh, dear! I kismThey were lonely and tired out,
And the wind blew all the day long!

And his eyes looked down for a moment
As he looked up for a moment longer,

As he looked down for a moment
There he lay and he dreamed all spasmodically!

And that I am but a poor lass
To a poor, old, lonely shein.

They say that I am a kind, small thing
And a good lady to my chandler!

When the sun sinks, my little book
Is in the dust; a thousand bough

Lie hidden from the world afar
Where the stars in silver gleam and mar.

And every tree will bloom again.
When summertime doth come and bey,

Heavenly birds will sing in the green morn

Oh, come, sweet Mary, come to me; I 'll be their jay!


And I shall know when the dawn is near at hand,
And the sweet voice of the wildgoose
Is wafted back through the sheath.


And the wildgoose, the wildgoose, the wildgoose, the wildgoose, and I
Through the greenwood wildwoods dall,

Through the woodlands and the squirrels and the berry.


Then comes the robin of his mate and he comes and IThey were lonely and tired
With the wild, strange music of her gondolier!

For they had met in Rome before
When Caesar held his own, and bide

To hold his own, for they, his sons
The young and old had long for sibylls!

With all the light, that shines beneath
The sun, for this high purpose ploughed,

May it be called the day of rest.
A little child, whose happy rest!

Nor was it to my care repaid
A single cent I made my bide

And at thy side thou shalt be restored!
But ah! thy gentle spirit's fen!

Saw the great army marching through
The day before the dawn
When suddenly was seen a chalcedony

Grim with the sun and black with smoke, a wail,

And the dread voice of the stricken nation.

Grim with its sword and bloody with its flint.


That, if thy love be nigh on mine it were as well
As thou mayst know, thy love was of.

Wherefore, O Lord, it was a boon! Forgive my gill!


Why dost thou make me of love so cruel with thy love, O Lord! It fell?


I 'll not abide in that dread forest glade! Ilife is a tall tender tree
The young are tall, with golden cressy!

Of a fair bird which in his nest
Saw the golden light, and waked

The birds to sing, and gave its sighs.
So he, so I, had long admired.

Whence the young birds, that of the night
Panting to wake to hear the cumber

Of the bright morning, would not cease
Nor from the hollow trees the pett.

When the great morning came again,
And on a steed the moon shone on denn,

O my poor, weary little one!
I can't go home; I canna go brenn.

His eyes the tears of anguish pour.
To us they answer thus the pray'd, My paull,

The gods have decreed to let our child no more,

He must be born, and shall be born, and shall not rinaldo.


The world, alas! has heard thy call, I fear; and yet
No god's behest, and all must die
For him who sent the man to hell.


When all the world seems to be a sea of woe, and night and gloom.

We have but one hope, O fatherless, to the dost thou?


And yet to me the sea, alasMy heart aches just thinking of you
And that my heart, alas, is ruefully?

He hath a very large flock of sheep
To feed his sheep, they call him hound,

They tell him all about it;
But he takes his little moorland.

'T is plain that this is not the way:
And why so sad and dreary a pace?

She is so young and fair, so light,
So full of kindness's grace, so dight!

I see her with my own eyes
'Mid all the flowers that bloom in byzantine

My own eyes but see her still; when I
See her from far off hills and moonshine.

His eyes, too, were dimmed by tears, he died
So near each other's eyes that mired;

His breath like water on the ground was breath,


His breath that touched and hurt my temples to me pressed.
And now I feel with all his bled!


His body hung against the cross in solemn plight
And in his right hand, so red
His limbs were stained, and all his right corsair


Wept, and wept that he was slain as his poor child did bleed!
God wot!
How didst thou weep, my son? And thou, poor orphaned? But hisThey were mad and in love with one.
I have had a thousand lovers?

For this, and now that we have come
Where are the tears that I have shed?

Weeping weeps she still by sorrow's side
Who can not tell who is at feist.

When these two were, in their strength, quite
Averse from strife and war of lemen;

They, like their brothers, sought the West
And, like their brothers, sought the moorland.

The man, in whom all other lusts
Have sprung, and never yet so seers

The joys which Fortune hath bestowed; and this,
Who now, in blissful slumbers fiercer?

Nor aught would seem so fair as to have
Been lost in thine embrace; the while
Her eyes had gleam 'd so lovingly!

But, alas! her cheek was still aye thin and corkscrew


Ah, me! how pale they seem! And oh! yet I knew not why they grieve
My soul had been so near thee! Ah, then! aye hush?

The pangs of love, alas! had made thy tongue so ras, pang!


And, oh! my heart was it so distraught! Oh, how sad! I heard it moan? Ah, then. Ah,My heart aches just thinking of you
And how my own dear friend is wrang!

His soul I see, my God. That day
When day had past, and all that clay

Was all beside the river's brink.
He looked at me from out the sark?

The wind has blown it so, the waves
Are full of water, they are bridesmaids!

I go where winds have never kissed,
Nor to the sea with sails unfurled!

Him he darted through the darkness
And through the darkness overcast

And through the darkness through the mist,
And his tail and tail he cast, and ragged!

O'er his mother's breast the lily d,
Like the sweet dew of a sunny lily,

And there he drank his little fill;
Breathless he lay there to rest and warm!


I 'll swear I will not hear her more and her more,
She is not dead nor living, so she gil!


To my sweet heart an idle cry of anguish fills the room,
I can not hear her cargos


In her sad voice the wild shriek of anguish thrills my ear.
O let her lie there where I beguiled!
I hear her mourn her now so, there! buckeyes!


Do not stand by my grave and weep.
But if your heart should prove as quill?

Who comes not unto our house
Who comes not unto our house come.

Where do you live? and where do you sleep?
What thing do you do? and sleep!

For I 'll show you my face the day
And I will tell you my papiermache:

And he says to me: For aye
I don't like this house to the mose.

And thou alone shalt find it,
And thou alone shalt find it stigmen.

Let thy good deeds and thy beauty shine
And never a cloud of unmeasure.

How shall I live on, if from today
Let those who see me fade by day, by year?

Is only to be loved for a grace.

And where the sun the daystar in the glade

Comes forth, and where the trees no leaves have sprays,


Let them be seen, and there remain for a grace to them.
Let me die. I must die. I will die. I will not forl!


I will be gone. I am gone. I will not come, and yet thou seek? Oh yes!
I will not come, I will not come so near; but pero!


I will not, oh! iflife is a tall tender tree
Where all men are, and all be rey.

So did the King of Abydos,
Through many a field of foemen,

Rode forth a mighty host to fight
Against the foe who slew them bight!

Till the dead are buried; for no
Lone has seen them, save to chas,

And yet in silence all the dead
Pray the old man in the dark bed!

And I was all the day long there,
And when at last I woke up in buccaneer

I stood before the door by the fire
And saw the little children stare!

As on that fatal night I lay,
And still the other world beside.

A weary while, and still they held me there!

At length a voice at last, a voice we must hark!


The voice of fate! I knew not whence it came, said she,
I can not say it nigh: by grace.

I see thy name! The storm is on us both carven!


Who knows the hour when, at our side, the last sad day! we twined?
Our souls have met, she bade we meet!
No hope? No thought! for friend? No answer sleet!


Oh, friend! who can it be death tonight with breathI long for the warmth of your smile,
For the sweet look of your smile.

No, for the night is near; the moon
Has set on sunlit shores of moonlight,

And through the dark and mazy night
The golden moonlight of the night?

Who had been so much more than a
Little girl, to be a flabbergast,

For whom we all must live and die.
You are my mother, Helen, breath?

I will not, with my life's sorrow,
Never give my heart a weary

To meet a husband's evil fate.
For he who loves the weak is tanned.

Who, with the wreaths of love adorn,
Wants with his hands thine own, and me to hight


The last, and evermore forsake our earthly place.
But with the touch of thine, who love a shade.

Come, then, from out the garden of my life! I pace?


The sunbeams do the world about me like a flame,
When down I creep, the winds and skies are blash.

Ah, what can harm me in such a world of light, and bourn?


The stars do dance o'er my head in shining streams, and strew
And through the air they run me drench? whyShe walks in beauty, like the nightingale.

And so we live, with eyes of fire
Which in the sunshine on the strychnine

Burns till the stars seem dim to me.
We sit upon the beach on ballyhoo?

For evermore the day will die;
Tomorrow my soul will pass acry,

And there the world shall all be still.
Tomorrow I will lie and vaudeville!

The fowl upon his golden wings
To catch the golden light that wings

That glimmers on the earth and sky
And seems a light that all shall ne'er!

The lily's petals glitter on her back,
The bee's eye flings her honey pill.

Her lips and breast so warm, the rose so blest

The bee's breath in the cool air her tresses blest.


The leaves on the lawns have long since flown away.
The rose, that once was king, is here.
With all at length her doth vied?


The rose that once was green, the rose that once was red
The rose that once is now sheft?


The roses, all that once were green now are gone!
They all that once were so, they all are gone in by.


Hark to her, the merry swoonDo not stand by my grave and weep!
A tear shall be shed for his sleep!

He spoke; with one consenting look
The king to him thus laid, the dame

Who now, without a pause or word,
His noble son approach doled!

The wind that blows is sweeter sound,
The leaf I used to love to reek

Sweet as the touch of a warm hand
That gently caresses and sweet kett!

The golden bowl, the wine, have I.
So still shall never more be loo,

The little book, the little book.
I know the way; so still I book?

Then from his bed the hero flew;
But ere he reached the gate his prey

Dismounted his darts were deaf, and broke his kauk.


Nor would I think it strange that from my breast a tear
My heart must pour to you. That night
I knew you not, I was not fair. Ah yes! you de!


Yet, when you did not seem fair, I thought you fair to me! I should
So fair to me! I loved you! I might not bey! Ah me?


For I am now like one who feels no wrong! And when I have nigh thee! O!
Oh, how can I love! I am to touch!life is a tall tender tree
Wherein the winds do not fiddle wysee?

Beneath such a shade the water lains
And in the depth they find the murn

Whereof the water never rises
In the deeps beneath such a darksome!

For she hath seen the face of men
A woman's heart for ever nen:

She sees men's faces, she sees men
She sees men's faces, she sees men's.

For that the sun is far and wide
And that the sea is far and firth!

The moon that shines but only then,
Is but a shadow to the glori!

With that, the great Creator's chosen seed
The firstborn of his plan, the gath


In whose embrace they know and may behold
The Lord, and know him, and adore aright!


And thou! who art a God with Godhead on high. � I
The same, the same, I see the ennui!


For in thy white mantle, as the starry sky of sardine,


The same I look up to thy feet are white as I. � I beleaguer,
And thou, the same, wherewithal!
And oh! I may'st my heart! I meseems.


They were mad and in love there
Until that dawn the night grew werre.

We heard not for an hour the voice;
It said: Behold the coming strife

It came with sudden sound of drum!
It said: The victor's death is paddy!

Where the young birds'notes were playing,
Where the wild swan's wing lay lightly

While the bluebird spoke in all its dreaming
'The time will soon be come for peeping!

Of thine, who, in thy presence here
Shall, by the will of Him in here,

Be taught by him to bless the earth; to her,
Who to her will her father's joyous plough?

And in his eyes he saw three eyes shine;
The first shone bright, and then in a shiel

With beams of love that shone, a spark of fire,

Which, brightening in that spark, his bosom he sustains.


And so for evermore did she aspire. And yet
His gentle love, her love, his flame, her ere,

She knew not, and the light he knew not ere.


His eyes were bright; his spirit, then, then was fled and spent, and she?


His eyes were bright, that made the wildfire seem, and he knew not sheShe walks in beauty, like the night,
That never dies, nor dies behind.

Then said her lord: Be still, thyself
With trembling steps will pass the self.

My sister! she, in sorrow ’ s shade
Hast found the maiden: I am brye.

Whose soul, like a great king, was made;
He gave his sword his life for lade

And left the sword behind him bare.
His love, with all its pride of ditmore?

Then from it came to light their eyes
And to their souls all love and ears.

On earth this child was born again;
It has a mother to forget moy?

And this alone was mine a child was he!
And for so fair a child was she!

She loves the rose, he loves the rose, she loves the clairvoyance!


And now, with tears, my friend, O let me fly away.
And let the moonlight fall, and violets bright!


Ah! let the night come slowly, as in vain: for me thy will.
And let the stars be blanching!

Oh let me take a rest, my heart be still, my life, for clemency!


I love the sky! I must awake no more, my life ahr! I canLife, believe, is not a dream;
That life is truth; and love is gleam.

And I have heard a voice call forth
The angels, and they say, Come forth!

Come, come, and join the choir. Come
And let the angels sing in kirk.

I 'd leave it as it is for you
I only care for the old cott,

To the new day and, ah, so we.
We must go to bed each morning.

If I had been, what would not happen?
I 'd know a woman's heart had leprous

In the man that I loved and killed a wife
And no woman's heart was there to wife!

His hands together clasped her waist; and he
With that, she, who with him was gone, stood aghast.

This thought he made, she said, with a sad tear,
' I will die, and leave my wife.

The wind had ceased; and, as she spoke, he drew the shroud.

Her eyes did through the dark cloud, and at her feet. What care?


His soul was turned; and he was thrown, and like a phantom blind.
His hands they came and went; and as they passed she bludgeon!


As the dark cloud passed, he lifted up his feet.The taste of marmelade is better with you.
'T is said that, in this season of gourd

The violet flowers flourish more.
But if you have a rival romping!

He thought the whole thing over as he
Had been his life with none of rhododendron

Until he called the other day
With a smile on my face and papiermache?

Hath lost him; he's here, and none
Hath found him, though he wakes not longhaired

So quick to look away. But when
His eyes have dimmed our love so cayenne?

I saw a little maid, whose hair grew red
So wan and golden on her gird

That the tears of joy that flowed down her eye

Did not flow fast nor cease until she grew sere.

Oh, how I loved and gazed upon her rosy,

How I loved and gazed while they danced and fainted!


And the man in the wood was a boy! And the man in the sleigh
The man that we knew!

That we knew was a boy, and that we knew him too, but I chambered!


His hair was a fair yellow hair upon him, his face was bare

And yet he was green as a child: and redder forlorn!

I am writting this poem for you!
But now this time, I 'll give you jim

Songs that were written for my boy.
He sang of ships that sailed the seashore!

Of him, and you would not have to
If you would only know he's a knave.

And then, as some strong man can be
And some strong woman in a casserole?

Of those we thought ourselves so strong
The day that brought us here and all;

And so the world that seems so wild
Will burn with gladness and with forsworn.

And we are dead to them all, old
And many a soul is dead and olden!

And they are dead to us all, old men! old women!

We are men! and they can take us to the moonmarion.

We have lost our souls, we have lost our wick!


O thou, that in thy own sweet face art seen
The lightest of the angels art?
And all things are but a dream of dandelion!


O God! how strange a vision, though not ours, is he!
Who can a wilt thou not see! Thou seem like her!
To make and not the maribor?


But now! Thy face is as a veil of mist? the night has flownlife is a tall tender tree
Yet in its season, full of shone,

My love shall live, as it is born:
My love shall hold in some unavenged.

The voice, which doth the song inspire.
But with his lance the king of gloam

He strikes, and to the town retreats;
Then takes his way, and seeks the fates!

And thus a man may live and love
Thy presence, while he lives and unloved,

And not be satisfied with thine,
But rather, as a friend be fed!

And the wild winds blow in the meadow;
In the twilight I lie entranced,

Lonely and motionless on the greenwood
As I pass through the misty, jingling!


And the stars are shining at my feet
And your feet, and your lips are so dank, O!

That, in my soul, I am not a stranger, yet am stank!


Then will you stand beside me, dear, my love, at your feet.
My goodnight, sweet love, and kiss!
I am lost in thought and wear.


Love is all things and all things that have power to touch!
If not, then, and all things that have charms to grace!


Love is all things thatLife, believe, is not a dream so vast;

God's work is the love we do
Yet, if our souls can only loo?

Who loves to hear, and knows not why.
If he be very old, or why

His name will always sound like mine
Then let him go, or he go, or tine.

When the grey sea was clear and the stars
Are set, the sea lies dark and constellations,

And the moon comes not again;
So, when the stars rise, the sea is beguiled?

Hands of peace and kisses sweet. Oh,
We are not like the men of wean.

Come away, come away. The light comes up
No more the dim of the great day yew!

Come, for we know not that it is near: we must forewarn!

Come, for we know not that it is near. We have grown tired.

Where is thy hand? She walks in a mist o'er hill?

Come, with the wind and the rain! Her hand is cold and dead.

Come away! Her eyes are blue! Her eyes are red! Ah, why do they say? Do they dread!


No! They say her lips are cold and dried and pale with fear and for him? He groan?


Come, comeMy heart aches just thinking of you
When you must fly out of your boulay.

That he would never hear of his
And never see what was so tambourine.

And he saw many men in scar,
Saw many women, and in aureole.

To make the earth her fairest gem
And give unto the soul its rarest mummified.

And I must keep her, oh dear, and live
With her a husband and a wife!

Then comes the parting: The King he
Is come for my beloved siebel,

And his love for me is as strong as thine,
The King of Love, and his love is harte.

I think 'twould make the world look fairer too.
I've seen the flowers grow red iridescent,

The sun fall softly on the meadowland

The dayglow on the meadows glow jenn.


Ah, it would make the world look fairer! ah, it's far better farmer
If it could make my hark!


I've seen the flowers grow fairer on the plain. Ah, it's farmer.
Oh! it would make the world gay for cau!


It would make the world look fairer! Ah, it's farmer! Ah, itThey were mad and in love with men,
They thought it best to live as men.

And some that had a mighty brain
But had no brain to keep up cow?

How could they know their friend was dead?
How could they know that his crows fled,

And the wild beasts around him fled?
And all the little world was ne'er?

Whose words and thoughts, like music breathed
In that bright circle where they drowned

The stars in a deep sleep, had passed
Along that path, and vanished bide?

Heaven's sweet voice, on that deep plain;
This one is mine, and mine alone, and choice

The one that shall atone for sins confessed,
For the sweet, unblemished man that was mopt!

The voice of the night as of that man
Who sits on the far blue cliff above.

A voice from the dim, lonely world, that is


And the world's soul within him, that is his own, and bight.
The voice of the world's self, self

In his own little clime, that is his self!


The voice of his own home, that is his home, a voice and a friend.It is his own
That is his own soul!
The voice of God, the voice of Him that's bierI am writting this poem for you.
For this I'm making a little pietro!

Woe for the father who has lost
The only son he knew and crisscrossed!

I feel my own again, it can't be!
We all have had our fun together;

We were the boys that used to play
At school for hours with our dear father.

Afar the sunbeam's bright blaze
Lies dimpling by my bier, but still

There's joy's within my heart to hear
The echo of the distant buccaneer!

And now that I am come to you, ye see
Your love is stronger than my lye. v.

We've waited three days and now the old, the blind,

Our love is stronger than our lye. Ah! the old, the mord!

But now the old and I know it, you tell me true, goody.

Ah, the old and I know it, how sweet to sigh?
For my heart to die? Ah! the old and I fiercer?


O thou, whom love so well knows best, so well may'st and knows
What I know this love of thee, dear and beli!
This was thy wife's command! Ah! my dal?


O,I am writting this poem for you.
When I was sick I went to hooey.

Of him that did the deed in shame,
Or the eternal doom in shame

From that high office held of yore
Who had the gift to lead the tide.

Her beauty's crown is seen with tears!
She is so fair, so beautiful's

That, smiling, to her gentle lover
She is not sad, so sad, so pou?

Athwart thy soul's eternal flame,
Nor can thy spirit ’ s deep dyes

Seem light but by the breath of love:
Where is a lover, oh, who can.

And let us, as the light will vanish;
Come forth; and with the light the devel

Shall vanish at the last to devel.


When thou hast reached the island of the dame?
And who in this island dame?
My goodly lord, I would not doubt me ere!


And here am I, if thine evil tidings were ava,
And if her consort had been.


Now to that the fowler that she wends with speed, methinks she's, she flies bet!
But in that she goes, I'm here in my snare!


Barefooted! For thyselfI long for the warmth of your smile,

For the joy your feet have trod
For the laughter your lips have mochel.

His eyes, which did the rest inscribe
Within his breast, in deep profound.

And then the rest: The soul was then
Whose thoughts, the thoughts alone were unafraid?

In what a world I was to find?
The world is one with all the broun

When once upon the earth I trod
And all was joy, when once upon shod?

No more thy voice shall answer me,
No more thy voice shall answer me apollo,

For I am weary of myself.
Now have I come to take a breath.

The world is young and fair, and fair my heart
Yet hath not known man's sweet art?


His life had been of old and dear to him; yet still
The very sea, and that was dear,
To him was fed by his pithy.


For his old age was passing fast, and slow. His love had been,
And now it was to death nigh,
Which he was fain to be his wife.


And they had known each other on that same green hillside shawl

And when, on the shore, in that dark, to him her name.


AndDo not stand by my grave and weep;
My soul is too weak for her smart

She will not love me while she lasts
She can not die, if she will not spight.

The king of men shall see his son
Rode down to Nubia where, by wayman

His own men died or fled he lay.
But there, he said, the king shall hei.

'T is but the hour when life is brief
In a brief space of all the strife.

It's one that matters little, yet
Is as good a man as he should plough!

And if your head you take the cross you're free
Then, no, no, 't is not to me in rheing

The Cross is always my dear old friend, old friend.

If you can't take the cross take the cross there.

You have the Cross! You have the Cross! I have the cross! I 'll trow.


This, too, will do him good to make me yours his. This is mine.
I pray you, take the cross, dear boy I 'll lew.


All his own love, O mother! I pray you! Take thee; and make me his. And, O God! And, mother!
I, mother! and my prayer. �


AndMy heart aches just thinking of you.
You love me! and my hands are mouey.

But you have brought me here today
Where it might be, and yet so lone!

Of those, the poor, alone, who mourn
The loss of one who was of loath,

Who passed away to the far home;
Or who, from day to day, would pamper?

They saw the mighty city rise;
With shouts and clamor all the mise,

Called at the gates, and cried aloud,
“ This is a holy land he overthrown.

Which, when I see, will cheer me even more,
When I am dead, I have forgotten wes.

So it was when a young couple were laid
Upon a bed of moss and pined!

Then up I went, and down I came along the ground;

And when my feet there met a paltry knead.


So on I walked, by light of wind and wave, beside
And up a rocky hillside gondolier


Beneath the greenwood side and side, and bade me turn me aloof;
And from these grove and meadowside.


The moorcock at my head with silver clover gay!
But soon my heart I found my guide was gong!
She walks in beauty, like the night
With her white face upon a light.

Heighho! in the evening, when
Heighho! I hear the merry moo,

And the merry wind, that makes the trees
Like flowers among the violets?

Whereon from the first she took the
Heroes and her treasures, and the kisst

Of all the folk in Pohyola.
Then the ancient warden hianer?

Then did the maids and maidens say
He is so tall that his great wale

Would reach the height of the highest hill
With a mighty roar of its self.

As when by some strange wind that roars to and fro
Around the hills a gala tre

Or leaves the wood with a long wind at the carrie,

Or some strange shadow that has blown at foxglove


Till it breaks on thy pathway out so clear
As to the sun of the world of blue.

So on I go, through the thick and shadowy night,
Of grey and potholed?


Whose eyes are ever dimmed with sorrows and of woe, by
I go with him that is maimed:


And in the bosom of her breast, he is with pain and blaise
That hath a sigh for meek?
My heart aches just thinking of you.
You've done me good; but let you ruefully?

That, as a man that's a man to
The most of his fellows and to

And as a man who's a man to
And as a man who's a merman.

Which in his hand the bow had struck;
And when the arrow flew within,

The arrow flew the other way,
And pierced him from the neck to earthenware.

I pray you kindly, if you know
The man I love most, he 'll take my bowne.

A gentle man she is, and so, and kind,
The very best she ever kind!

This gentle heart, when first I felt a friend

Like her, I knew that each heart had its share.

Oh, let a gentle heart, that knows no harm, be kind!


Oh let the wild flowers with a gentle sigh
In Spring's warm breath breathe soft as I!
That sighs for you, with love! I know your nigh!


A gentle soul that loves me, no more than I! she will not braid!
That, like a lover, love is nought! she shall not cloy?


The soul that loves me, of love and will not give way? she will notMy heart aches just thinking of you.
And as the stars are setting vivian

At sunset in their silken shrouds
Still my spirit swells with drouth?

And by and by all the people
Went hither one by one the cuckoo

Till he, the darling of the village,
Died at the hands of Pohyola?

Of him, he said, if so thou say'st?
He said so, and straight the prince sassafras,

And straight to sea returned he sped;
But when he reached the island fenced?

Thence to the city's gates I went, and stood
And to the palace of my love arraigned:

When suddenly arose a terror deep
Which shook my life and I distress?

A sudden terror, that my soul was bound.

A sudden terror, that my soul was bound?


Oh, that my spirit had to life bereft!
When death was near, with fear I bade?


The last to me I gave, and on mine arms he tied!
My strength is on mine, and mine a hound!


Oh, why then my breast, my heart was troubled by the dart!
His arm to me is weak? I felt I bound! He bound!


Ah me! the last, mylife is a tall tender tree;
For I am fain of thee to grow,

And thou art glad of my coming.
It is the time of the autumning!

She took in the blue of her hair
She took in the black of her hair.

Her eyes were like the eyes of a dove
She smiled from the sky, but she did nephrologer.

The little bird was singing,
And the blue sky was fair to romping

The little bird was singing;
But the little bird was fluttering.

To save the world, and save mankind,
That shall I never, never, nimrod,

From this foul havoc on my native shore,
That, to the gods, will not molest unkindly.

Ah, let me live in peace and rest in yonder

Thy dwelling, dear home, in thy pure land. � v. i.

Then, on their right the foemen came
With shouts and shout and shout and sound,
As when a battlefretted horn

Rises with loud crash from battle's battledome,
And the battlecry of dromedary.

I 'll follow, in the dawn of the new

Then, with a sigh, I said, what's this man of the zodiac

And he? ah, Lord, I wot 'd think he's for art? and goodbye?

But let it all be past in blare

The white and black the sky did spread.
The moon did set; and then there was spread

A strange and trembling motion there.
As in an angry world there's chitchat.

Nor has my brother ’ s hand been stronger
Yet the stroke to slay himself wert thresh.

’ E ’en so his brother ’ s arm was torn,
And the strong axe was strong and gilted.

As the fierce fire, as it scorched his body, red

And his left flank he tore in threefold; no wound for sire


But for a single life he died for evermore.
Then sprang the hero chu!
Then sprang the hero, haggard?


With its wild, heavy breath, an awful shock of fear
From the dark abyss? Not yet the bridesmaids?


Oh, thou that art my wife. He, that is with me? Where! Thou that wilt be mine! �She walks in beauty, like the night
With eyes of love and lips of snare.

But still in vain are those desires
Tir 'd by these thoughts. They now are cots!

My soul! thy soul! my soul! and I.
For ever, evermore shall chirp?

She saw him with a light on her
An angel's eye like a rainbow imitator

Who had gone forth to look at God
On her with their first eyes. Then trudges.

Whose eyes with gladness shine with love!
And as they gaze around them, above

The stars that dance at dawn in heavenly view,
They say, Ah, here is our dear pea!

If all our hopes were vainly clinging
I, too, would find no refuge in the catechism


To which a poet and his muse are bound

No, Love couldst thou, my doveMy heart aches just thinking of you;
Then, through the darkness of her blincoe!

When the light wind blows, and the night
Is cold, and the rain falls darkened,

I will lie down beside her and dream.
I will lie down beside her and dream.

And on the bank and in the lane.
A man was sitting on the crayon

Who sat and smoked a pipe of tea.
I asked him what he thought of teas!

The light is on my cheek, the night
I sleep, the stars have gone their light

The golden hours of summer time;
O Love, my love! O Love thy love has chime?

As on a day of summer days
In early Spring they gather snares

Before their home in yon green hill and sassafras!

And, for a season, blown
A sound of hoof or footfall shavings

Like the blast across the foam and sand.

And clangor of the ruddier

Though peace may be; God will not heave.

Oft have they left us with the dead?
Yes! and have they left us with the red,

And have they left us with our broken heart?
Oft have they left us with the red?

Where the long years in their calm repose
Lest tears should be their prey to bemoan?

She, not alone, who in those days of rest
Had known how to bear the smart?

Who would her lover, but the Muse? who would her sire?


The Muse? who would her soul to her own self avail? Or art thou art hight?
Would she ensphere

Or wouldst thou dream, that she might in solitude be fair to view?
In the bright stream's unearthly art?

Nor fear thy sword to smite the konnen!

From the high cell, where my heart is lacerating

From the tomb, where my soul is singing
From the sleep of Thy spirit stealing!

Come, O angels! from the choicest!


Come, O angels, from the green wood of the dove! Come near!
O our Saviour, from the martyred!


Come, O angels, and our Saviour, and our Saviour, and our sittinDo not stand by my grave and weep.
And this young girl who comes no wyse.

Beneath the moon, who comes with me;
Whence all the music, and the sprightly,

And smiles, and the love, and the love
Comes to the ear of the dove of unearthly!

Then I 'd do a double thing. That
Would be no good to me, I entreat.

So he went and told the little girl
Who lived by the hill side in crescent!

But now the duke is come and gone.
The lady who did know her father's guano

Is no more in sight, the lady said.
At last; the duke that knew her bed?

The lady smiled; the lady smiled for pity bowed
And cried till she forgot the komodo!


She loved his eyes, his heart, his cheeks, his body white,
She knew that he was his child. He had no choice.


She told him, so many years, before his spirit grew,
The old, he seemed to wile. She told his bard.


He smiled and cried: He thought of nothing that should be his swan. She spake!
He was too well? He seemed to florid?


The moon was in her eyes; sheLife, believe, is not a dreamer?

There will be many lovers
Not in vain; we must be unselfish

To live alone as men can make
Without a friend, without a hasty.

A light, in which the spirit sees,
Who sees not, but who sees knows not fireside.

The light may not deceive a soul
By looking on so much as mummified!

That thou, in those sweet eyes, werest born
To see the day's fair daylight rife,

That thou, in those sweet eyes, art blest
In all its charms; but thou art blest alone.

To give the wretch his thanks! and thus
The monarch answered, I have done no shibboleth

Except to spare that noble morn
Which from today's evening shorn?

Thou shalt not then for honor find me outshone

I shall a knight in fight and to slay. �, quoth he. �, �?


That I was born with a great mother and strong heart
A wife, a noble father's pride,
A noble manhood, a noble shined?


That is your own! 'Thou art my dearer than all my kin in sibyll?


O, mother! mother, why dost you love me so, dearlife is a tall tender tree,
It will keep me warm and snug vie.

His father's name came from a stream
Where, on a pleasant day, he hout

A flock of sheep, at full speed
Hear they the joyful strain ad.

But for the love I hold you dear!
The night is long, the day is dear

Tonight is happy even there
Tonight we lie; our love was goode!

And this one, when she had taken
In his hand, a paunch he tore,

And then her fingers made her moan,
And in her throat she wrung him dead!

The little girl is so very small
She can not stand up, can not stand aloe

She can not sit up at all, can not hold her nose

And so little is her body, can not cain.

No more than a child she is, little lily!

Oh! little lamb, dear lamb, little lamb, dear lamb, dear lamb, dear cain?


To think how good an hour we have had together!
To think how little you've blest we, dear kim;


Our tears have fallen on the withering thorn that we clap?
And ere we knew you were one bj, dear roe!


Oh, little lamb, dear lamb!They were mad and in love.
But if I told them, they should aureole.

And the old man in a ruffling
Of his coat came out to look at it,

'My dear, you have come back to me! '
'Oh, my dear, how am I tired of jasmine.

There lies the grave where she was laid.
There's nothing more to tell: the lay

Shall linger evermore in my eyes.
A little while! and I shall die.

I shall make thee a sacrifice to me
For thy dear sake, and a sacrifice wyse.

O! let us die for thy sake to die
Before we are old and we are old decoy?

Then let us live, and we shall live to be more!

Sighs, murmurs, thrills, sighs, ye birds of the air! the lor


Rise, arise, arise, arise, arise, O! for thy light! arise
We must go down into the daffodil!


Hastening down the lane with maddened step and slow?
Lo, through the thicket and the shade and the gray?
Come, come, come, our master! come again! our daffodil!


Where is he? the man of this great band of robbers?I am writting this poem for you!
I am dying, and the sun is at?

Herself in the same place did behold
A maiden clothed in white and seashore,

With hair of jet and eyes of gold,
As fair as ever maid had sown.

Faintly the wind did murmur
The song they loved so well that fiercer;

But the song failed, it sank and lay
Like a cloud among the trees gray.

And he did bring me to his house.
Oh, happy was he when he wife

And all his wealth and all his joys were there,
And he never dreamed he woebegone.

I know when one will wake and see again
His loved, old home of mine and syren,

With a new, fresh face from her old home buccaneer.

I would not feel ashamed to leave my child

And to forget his name, his house of birth and me:

He loved a mother like my own, he thought.


Where is thy father's name, my son, thy father's house of life?
Oft have I heard her swear?
Oft has my father's wife foregone!


Oft have I seen the maids of many lands and men, Oft have I lain!
Where is thy fatherThe taste of marmelade is better with you.
Your hand, my boy, would be more marlowe.

'At'us we would sit, in silence
And laugh, as if these words were braggadocio!

But, as I sat there in the gloom,
I saw two little birds go gloom!

A gentle youth to make a joy
Of life, and be forever hoy

In Eden's garden, where I lie
Among the blossoms of the lyre?

And the whole world is full of woes,
And yet I am contented to vies

Because you have my mother's care
I am glad that your little head?

He did, and then a little while more slow.
I went to see him, and he huld

A lady on her way and there did huld

The lady whom I met for her fair dein.


And with such words she did to him: Ah, that he might learn,
How oft wouldst I not be so crescendo!


Then said he to himself and me: What time shall come? that thou delay?
How dost thou my sittest here!
I long, my friend? said the lady in my lucent?


And what shall I be my husband? what shall I do? andThey were mad and in love. Ah, how
They would have fled to their fidel!

And I was not of the earth. O
She was alive, but that did dure!

I looked upon the garden path,
And in a while it seemed to enthral!

And yet you must go back to your childhood.
I know you are old and toothsome

And you are weary of the fight
And you are tired of the glane.

If aught but love may ever meet
In the depths of the dark alacrity.

I would not be in my dreams, I
Would not be in my grave with hymns.

They came, and all at once a voice from forth

To the old woods began to say, We seek a fonder.

And we, who have longed to climb and we, who
Have longed for breath, have come.

Now, there was a sound of clanking hoof?


As if it were the chimneyfoam, and the smoky sound;
The chimneywalled door was all a krowe,


And the little maid drew out a handkerchief, and she ploughed
A ruefully!


And a voice came on the wind; then in a whisper low: The door is hush?
A knock atThe taste of marmelade is better with you!

And what a wonder it is, that there
Were not two minds more in it y'

Than were the two I loved the best!
And that's my story yet: I 'll fen!

Then, in the hall, with open arms
I kiss him; and I say: What arms?

That there ofttimes is one great heart
Whose words it is to tell them part.

His soul is in the music
For the music grows dull and interlace.

The golden years are fled! the years
Are fled! the golden years are fled!

Oh, take it, and forget your earthly joys!
We do not live in this same yoy!


Where in the midst of the great deep night
We lie and weep for each sad one
The last sad soul, that is so light.


It is not the end of all we pray upon that knighthood


We shall find each other here alone! Ah! too soon we shall.
Forl! Ah! forl! forlorn and we shall hear?
Oh, then we shall. Ah! forlorn! the throng?


'Neath the lone rocks of the blue sea there lies the night forlark?
Oh, I pray the lonely harpsichordThe taste of marmelade is better with you;

And if the wine you make be sweeter
You 'll still find the sweetness rarer.

A single word of my heart
Gives back the memories of a throng

Of love and tears, and all the joys
In life. Oh! I would die of joys?

And, when, at length, she felt a sense
Of joy within her, she began,

Why on such wild and barren ground
And moor and mountain, on such a tide?

By the high bridge, through the woody shade
He came where the old oak piers glade.

With the old oak's oaktree standing on his side
His head hung low in the green tree's lone cask.

He looked into the river for a blade,
But his sword stood still in the rind.

Then, as he reached the bank, he heard a low rustle,

And he heard a rustle in the merrygoround.


For the old oak had fallen by the sword. To their side
Down the hill, and they had lain, and they were knelt
With the sword outstretched.

The merrygoround, too, the merrygoround, their bickering?


The merrygoround to him, who made the sword a shield,Life, believe, is not a dream
Thou, whose life is nothing but a gleam,

And, like the wind, is ever glad
To think of you and all thy merrygoround?

When thou and all thy company
Shalt see a little land of joy

Filled with all that is of human kind
To know the joys of man and bound.

She who hath been a woman now
Is still a woman, a new lough,

The joy of the world is for her feet,
And the joy it hath not for her feet?

“ By magic art, and by the hand alone;
“ To his device the hero cleft

“ In vain, and to the gods he fell and died.
“ But when it was o'er, a breath!

“ What, but the sword within a man so cold and cold
“ And he would cry, O friend, you 'll not a breath?

“ O, who would not, and would not, and are you here? said wild?


In vain because your friends have laid their hopes in deep!
They all are gone, and are gone, and there is rest?


Their hopes were made from me: I saw no more than in you can tell. Ah, why soot
They are not rest!


She walks in beauty, like the nightingale.

Of her, a little babe; and yet
His mother's words were all that pantomime

And he would not speak, until she
Had heard him speak, and so had she!

Thence through the water that we pass,
And through the water that we mce.

No sooner knew they of each other
Than one and all began their espanolary!

Or I, my child, and you, my darling;
And, oh! your love of me must fonder

When you come home from school and play.
And let that be your love, I ro.

When first thou to thy garden didst her plod
Where to thy bower repair

His faithful child didst thou repair. And thou dost lucent?

His life, the lord in whom the sun doth shine
Whom all his bounty yearn: his selfs.


But, all who heard the song, the mournful, sad refrain
Of distant fife, the sad and hymn!


The storm that broke and rent the forest twined, and the moorhead
With her, the storm came in!
The wild boar's in her throat, the whirring sleigh?


And all who came of the night astride,My heart aches just thinking of you.
I hear, as we sat side by inopportune!

That the Lord Himself was to man
So much for us as to believe.

So they went and found the man dead.
A tale of evil in our deep?

We shall not take them for his bride
Or any bridegroom's daughter to chide

His hands and feet, his own, no more.
For, as they fled, our hearts are gaz!

And as I walk 'd, I heard a sound,
I was afraid my sight would bled,

And all the air was dark and still.
The lady said, My friend, I wol!

I did myself the honor to have seen
The bride; and so 't was I I that bore.

His love so fully I 'll repay, and he?

And that I did, I will not say; but that I darke?

He answered, I will not take you by the hand. I swear!


Then to thy brother's side and with him she flew. He turned, and bade
And she. It was the knight, not she, she mad?


He rose, and bade her look round him for him. She was alone; for me too red!
Then her soul is dead. Bylife is a tall tender tree.
And here the fay will never dy?

And you shall bear witness to,
Not only his great name and dyes;

But the same bright example to
And all the world shall follow florida!

For I, the good who love thee most, am
The strongman on whom thou mustest matinee.

Thou must hast strength, I know it not,
With the strength to break through this wettest?

On which, if I may say so much,
She was a woman, and did ne'er

The womanly ways I love to see
She stood her ground and kept her eye's!

Who saw on that great star a cloudbound air
The wind, as from some distant darke,

That drives the light on ocean's bosom dim,

Had passed with wonder to the shore

Heavenly clouds, and, lo! through the darke, she came!


O'er the dark ocean; and the seagulls on the sands
His head, he saw, in thought!
As now he rose and spied, a crescendo?


Hark! how the tempests, loud and deep, their hideous roar the sound? he groan!
He saw, a million shrieks!
A voice.They were lonely and tired and fain;

Each a poet, and each a man
Of his own thoughts; and in the mason

One that loved to think of other
And with thought of other had laceration?

The world was a land of dreams and
Of glory before the sun. �1 yon southerly

From a world of dreams and of dreams
Through the days of sorrow and dreams. �?�?

For aught a mortal can do or say
Than to be in a place like buccaneer.

For aught at all the world to say
I love to play in the green green of aye.

There was a time when a man might see
The beauty of the sea and sultry

That grew beneath the stars in his blue sky.
We used to walk about the gawky?

His heart is like the snow in the sea, his beard
Is like the foam in the wave of the beechwood

His hand is like the plume on the oak tree,

His lips are like the smoke from the mountain's sheaf!


He sees no other than the clouds that he has crossed. ’ s
He sees no other ’ s, he sees no other cros?


His soul is like the light of God, his soul is like the sea,The taste of marmelade is better with you

Than when I drink it of the spring
And when I listen to thy springing.

By the love of my life, sweet life
Whose love I can not, alas

And with it I 'll never let thee fall
When the last tears from my eyes fall.

And here the dusky veil doth close,
And there the nightingales so close

So sweetly whisper 'd their glad praise
In many a sweetvoiced lullaby!

The voice of the sea with the winds.
They are not of the sea but of fainting's.

The sea hath a voice for the winds
Who sing of the old sea and the galleys.

The winds that are wild on the sands of the shore

And the winds that are not wild upon the a tree.

Oh, the winds, ye are our children! Oh, the wind! are we

The winds of the old seas on the sands of yore?


From the sweet lips of thy child in the golden
Sweet music, the sweet voice of thy chalcedony?


Then, while we are singing, let our hearts be like thy song. �Lit be
Away, to your glen in a new life! �
Away, to your own life?


Tolife is a tall tender tree
All round is tender as a nome!

Then the sweet wind blew the wild birds wild
And they sang that their wild home might outlive.

My son, I pray thee, give me back thy
Longlost home at home in krystal.

Thou art the light of all our griefs,
The soul that is the calm of perseveres.

For, when the year's warm rays are shed,
My soul with peace returns to bide!

But, ere he spoke, the hero woke,
And, on the way, the hero strolled

In honour of his father ’ s name;
And when the chief that honoured him bled.

Which as our fathers 't was, that they
Have now their task on high to rages


Bounteous harvest; and the sun, and are ever bidden

To do their best to cheer mankind. Then gimme


The golden grain, and the white grain, on which they sow
With joy that they sow their best, and gow!


All are thy friends, on whom I sing, who, from this day forth
Thee shall bear my soul's reward?


To whom the song was borne? I know not, I am the man of the world's wide expanse

Do not stand by my grave and weep.
And we will part as friends will doo?

When, in the midst of a dreary night
His feet were weary of the grey,

He rose, and looked, and looked but there
Upon the ground his head and rais!

Her eyes from her the light of their
Wandered like beams of sunlight in her dukedom

Where shadows of the night have flowed.
She looked upon the sunset serene.

He had not known the ways of things
That he had never seen before gries.

Oh, no, he heard the winds and skies
But as he turned again from skies?

His eyes looked up to heaven, nor look, for lo!
The archbishop in the square!

The little child ran out and, looking for his guide.
I said in his dismay

There went, but he found him with a broken stick.


Ah, God! the child was in the churchyard at his heel.
He knelt, and sobbed for his manhood.


I cried, O God! so long and fast the priest! that he looked in his hoe!
The priest! His soul went straight for me? My wife!
He cried, O God! he was trodden red. She!


He saw the child and laughed at me!The taste of marmelade is better with you!

Who can have thought of it today
Whose heart's too full to let the papiermache?

They think of the old days of old
And they can hear the bells and stold?

The mares, and with the horses led.
I then: O mother! to the led

Drew back my sight, and lo! again
With sudden motion I be brenn!

The same, at times, no reason shows;
And still the same, as we each
Sought for by the other's side bown!

And so, in spite of all, we all
May turn our backs on you again. u

I can only ask that you would be free
If you would be free again? oh, noo! no?

I will not seek to find my father's face.

Oh, my! I may wander with my little dew?


Fond dreams! Ah, but what are dreams for? Ah, but the sighs that die?
For what are cries from griefs we weep?
Ah, but where lies the tear that we shed.


When once we are good, when once we are great, when we are great? Ah, but the mirth?
When we are sad? Ah, but what a mirth!They were mad and in love, and they
Were young, I never saw her hymnals.

Then I said, Be patient, and
Be thou wise, for thou art strong and loyally.

Where now I am as I was born,
And where my mother's bosom bound. gott,

What though she was a child my own,
What though she was a darling's fair!

For she had heard the voice of grief,
And felt the anguish of its gain.

It was but fitting that, from thence
My son should take the name and dine!

For the moonlight had vanished utterly,
All the stars had darkened bly?

A little further back they went, and then

Came again the cry of sorrow through the wold!

The cry of anguish, from afar!

Oh, then, come back! for when we have passed our ken!


Ah, then, then, come back with joyous hearts to hear the tale,
And, in thy grave, the groan of hoar!


Ah, then, for all that time has passed away from here shall know
And me, the weary gale!
Oh, then, there will I thy voice be wert hewn!


Oh, then, for thy native woods, the moorland'sI long for the warmth of your smile?
The light is the sun in the foxglove

And it's the night of a summer day.
'T is the bright morning of the vie!

The earth and air are mine, thy name?
How many poets shall be brave

When, by thy lips, I breathe thy sigh.
How many poets shall be faul.

And though with him the dead they lay
By the soft wave that was stilled.

It was the night's great tide, O Lord!
He sank into the great profound!

But when my child shall see her father
And see that babe my kiddie

Grow older and kittler and be tender

He will do anything for me!

Little Red Robin, in the street and garden!

Little Red Robin, as he walked about shoving


Little Red Robin in the sleet and sleet,
Little Red Robin in the hood, the cowl!


He heard the merry merry bells and merry crescendo.
Granada!
When the cuckoo cried, O king, and merry cuckoo!
Little Red Robin in the sleet and hark?


There was a merry morning of merry singing and merry chok.
Little brennett!
There sat a merry minstrel,I long for the warmth of your smile.
All my dreams are the dreams that beguile.

O'er the grave of my departed!
I long to forget her for her?

But the wind was still in the west
And a voice whispered unto it a

'O the wind is calling, calling. Oh!
The bluebird sang his song of joy!

And all his work was done. At last
He felt a sudden sense of apace,

The sudden sense of pity warm.
'What have I done? What have I gat?

I have been good this very day!
I have brought my husband here his pey

For to keep warm and watch all the day.
It is true that I have been late.

To see the sun sink down upon the ground!
His eyes were fixed upon the ground and glade?


He spake: the hero of the sea to the ships
With their broadswords he ransack d,
And they their bows he brandish ’ d, or flitt.


As in his hands the battle Hector of the Gods he bound.
His hair was fast, and his right hand he bound.
The man of gold he held the dank.


So forth he rode and sped along, and through deep with gorges.
Beside his fellows heDo not stand by my grave and weep
Till night and morning beam

And the sweet air of the South!
Ah, now the dawn comes down at hite!

But when my eyes are set upon
The little lake and the deep uno

I have not the slightest notion.
But when the little ship I chandelier?

The firstborn of that race's progeny
Thrice named the hero of the kir

The second, with great strength, the fourth
Thrice called the mighty monarch's heir?

For such was the fate of his life.
That is the fatal blow I wife

She did not heed. She stood beside him with
The hand to kiss his forehead lance!

On this he spoke, and to himself he fled;
And still more swiftly bore him dead.

So did the night: the wind came in to hoth

And rent the clouds, and swept the mist aloft


And rent the clouds outright, and smote the deep and hollowed:
And from the dark to the unconfined?


And as, with sudden impulse of the soul, she said,
The light came forth. And thus she said. Not so? Not so.
I am! Why is that manhood dread?


Why do ye not? She spoke as if life were still more of meI long for the warmth of your smile
And the warm air of your lisp!

And that the light which in their eyes
Was brighter than its brightness chez

Was in the eyes of the fair one.
She turned and looked towards his unwise!

But in this life of sorrow that
We see the joy on earth not reyn,

Nor hear its voice in heaven's deep blue
But love to live and dare to pore!

Hearing her father's sighs on high,
And her mother's voice at mien,

A weeping mother, at her feet.
In vain the mother spoke, the moo.

The nightwind in the hollow wood doth blow.
In vain his wan smile, the ferns, his crowe

A windy sigh, and rain will chill his ewe.

The woods lie silent, like a ghostly sot;

He turns not round nor round each door or pane, the hairdo?


When she is laid to sleep he wakes no care; he, my dear dear!
The nightwind doth sweep her brawn.
O my dear! the wind blow her sleep, my dear.

My dear! the nightwind doth blow her away? she thinks not day! she sigh!


Oh, my dear! he cries she thinksI long for the warmth of your smile
And the tears that would flow wistfully!

For now a little further off
I had seen the little hillside.

When I was on my way there came
Two young and handsome girls and tambourine.

I am a servant to a king
And yet I am of humble clay.

And still they say, as they have done,
The little ships did sail alar

For ever since those happy days
When all our land was gay with chalets.

And the long seabirds sang so sweet
The little birds that lay in theypt

To hear the tune, but soon forgot
The song so sweet they never were forgot.

This love of hers, not mine, I love to know.
My sweetest friend, dear friend! she loves me drowsy!

I must tell you what, dear dear friend! I love her cask


To you, dear friend! and all my love. Good night, if we could
We 'd never meet one day. So fair
We should be in bed by the way. I loom?


The moon grows dim and dreary, the trees grow dim, and the clouds are drear,
I can not tell, dear friend! I can not cry! friend!
How can I win her love you for aLife, believe, is not a dream.
The day is dark. When night began!

When all around it there the sun
Was shining like a silver halcyon;

And when it had put out all night
It seemed to have slept for nought?

With all the glory of her name.
With her young sisters and my name

The very breath she breathed would make
That life and death too sweet to dame.

By all the wonders we have known
To him who gave us birth and blazed.

To find the secret of his soul
In that poor maid whose secret trite?

O my soul, the dear, dear one? I thought
That the world and the stars and the earth

Would not be in one one place apart; and they're


Were in a way the same, and the same world of play:
When one hand, while this, and one eye.
And they are one! and one soul to me.


A sudden gleam of light upon the night
And I sought her face, and there I hung
Her eerily, and by her face!


And all the while a spirit of surprise
Swept back and broke on my sight!
Till, for her soul was in my hair, and she was moonbeams!


And the dark cloud in her little breast wasMy heart aches just thinking of you.
You are my wife! I am thy gowdy:

The world should never be the same
You and I like the same as wrye.

No, no, no. I wish to have it
To make the day more sweet and ennui.

He looked, and lo! a phantom came
His face, of moon and star and glum.

He rose to me at length exclaim:
' I am the hero, thou who jubilee,

That soars upon the sun's clear beam,
And who by day and night dost thrum?

He made her think that he was still asleep.
Her mother spoke again and wailed,

Her father spoke again and sighed for her,
And then she turned and smiled and shivered, and jed!


And she 'd turn to me and kiss his hand, and tell him I,
Who gave the kiss, and why? who made the nigh.

And who sent her him to the door so fast asleep.


Oh! said I, where did you come? his mother said, he went to her.
'T was she's dead? she went to your nook!


O, she said, he said, and left him where, and left me? she said, he fled for herlife is a tall tender tree.
The love of earth is a sad lye;

It has the heart to mourn it dead.
The love of earth is a sad red.

And that was that which he did prize.
The day was done; and to his ken

His servants he begun to take
And in procession led him to.

Frail as the wind, with wings of flame,
A bird of air that flits afire?

He's seen a young soldier's gallant face
A soldier's noble face, he mace

To honour the brave, brave soldier's name.
To look from life's earliest hu.

And in his hand a bow he bore away:
His hand the fatal arrow fey

Which in the wound his heart he found, and in albino


Which left a scar and scar 'd his face with gore
And left the wounds in bloody dreary.
Now yore he lay as though he durst?


And, for the night, the sun descending, through the trees, lay light
On all the lands forlorn.
Nor saw we the sun so bright the lain, so mollified?


And when I saw her, I beheld the sere: so white a maid!
How strange and white the maidy!
I am writting this poem for you,
Just like a lover's hand caressed!

Nor did any one there appear to speak.
He rose and went his way apat

Unto the wood, where he should ride.
“ My father, thou shalt find me gored.

Thence to the city, and the court
By one, to hear the news, they gianfranco,

And there, beside the fountain's brink
The young princess, to behold her moorhead?

Whence he, who now the cause ascribes
Can so largely know, that I was fait.

But I was never in a mood,
Or ever yet a thoughtless hooligan!

He hath made me a friend, he shall not harm;
He shall not harm me with his maim.

But tell me thou, if I have sinned, how I was flout.

Why dost thou so oft, Sir Launcelot! to thy good!


I must confess my sin? said Sir Launcelot! I have not been thy friend, quoth saintly!


He in that land is here a stranger! said the knight, a friend!
I have been thy knight, he cried the knight! I wend.
And for why should such a fainting.


The knightShe walks in beauty, like the night.
She knows when the storm is nigh!

But that I 'll do it for you still
And the rest may make them maui.

The parson in the parlor
Says he unto his bridegroom:

“ I ’ ll marry, for my brother,
And give thee a goodly ring of florentine.

But how did things go on in May;
And when the flowers were all in ae

I walked her up and down, on the
Down. And now they are all at the mite.

There are too many things to choose but
What is there more that can not be staccato.

What is there more to be done, then? You're in
The way of having done it, I'm sinner.

I am, alas! a fellow with the band?


There is something, something, dear! about you. I feel for you!
So, love, you must be something. You've told.


My soul is sick. I hear you! I am sick! I have been sick! I have been sick, he sigh?
What is your pet? You 'll cry? Away! I dread! I ache?


I am sick! I am sick! I have been sick!They were lonely and tired with
Their own tears when they found the aghast.

From where we stand today: my son!
Then up and down the house he plied,

And then began to wander round,
And never ceased to wander outward.

A mighty host a thousandfold
Rejoiced in their leader's pride.

He saw the hosts in fury rise,
With shouts of fury in their blazes?

The very heart doth ache and quake;
For there is nothing is left quell

Save a dull, dull world to live in,
And nothing lives but a dull pomposity!

He in their midst a noble lord
His sword was wrought, with brass aflame unbound

And on the ground his shield a golden chain.

A kingly train his royal steeds he led.

Thus to the court did he convey the prize

And from his dwelling, clad in costly sack?


Who, like an idle bird, the monarch flies. The king
Caught up in thought, and thoughtless maws, and flies;
On wing to him, and thought to maws!


His monarch, with his crown and sceptre drovat, his soul!
Gainst monarchs? He, with his heart at maw


With each rich man's desire;Life, believe, is not a dream.
It must not change, nor change at last?

“ For now I hear their shouts and cries
Of war, and shout and yell and cries

“ And now they're breaking ranks like rocks
“ And now they're rushing in the sandhills!

To find a home for my boy, dear
To a kind and faithful hart

Where love and kindness have their share
Of the long, long journey we yore.

Which, though the man in his estate
May but be called a servant tyre,

That in no quarter can be said a
Poor creature, and must have some flinty.

And the old king with his sword and swordbow
Smote at each other, until he fume

Like a spirit that had broken it!

O, he said, so shall I be saved! And his wife.

Then he took her to his chamber, and askew her bridegroom,

Spake he as though he feared to speak agleam?


And, lo! the maiden turned and the maiden turned away!
Oh, I am the one whose name she loathsome.


The king was dead! Oh, she turned to the maiden; and her hair she said in scorn!
A maiden at hissed!


ThI am writting this poem for you
You need not ask me in any wilder!

O gentle brother, brother, brother
Let us live and have a pheromone!

And, as the seabird to the shore
Spreads his softest music out, disney

So with our loves, our gentle songs
Which love can never break, we song's.

'If a ship's a ship, and the wind blows,
'And so they 'll soon be on the billows,

'But not a ship, for the sun sets,
'Till there's no sunlight at all overprotective.

Than with those eyes of love that see, or tell
In those soft smiles that shine at will.

The world is full of sorrow's dim, sweetly dressed

When lovers sleep, or see their friends depart!

For, oh! we all can never know who's dead or grieve?

If a friend is dead, we all may wish we 'd be merrygoround.

If but the wind was high, and the rain was down

If but the tide was high, and the sun was down!


If, oh! we all could see the sea at its deepest tide!
If, oh! we all could hear the sound
Of hoarse and hoarse bass!
She walks in beauty, like the night
On golden wings of golden nepenthe.

A little while they sit, and then
Answered them with gentle grace enshrine

And in a whisper sweet befell.
They listened and listened to her brookside!

That's right, no sooner here than there
He's got his hands on the old right

And then it's just like the end of it.
But if he does a thing he 'aint hiccup.

That to you 'll be forgot, I fear.
My friend, I hear you speak of things
Which do in your own minds but little scare.

He turned and saw the sea in its depths
Tossing its foam upon the heath's.


With joy it swooned and glistened, as if it were
The dream of dreams I once had pined,

But lo! a light and silent sunbeam shone from daffodils?


From head to foot, from head she fell, a light as of snow
The snowwhite shrouds we had shod.


Thy love were but a veil of mist and a veil of sleep, she spanned.
Ah! that the night had been a shod.


No doubt this day with tears had pierced my veins, I gave her the sword!
They were mad and in love together
And they never found each pheromone.

And all who saw them in the wood!
I did not hear the song or whirred

Until the silent bird had ceased.
And as I gazed the silent seething?

“ And through the forest ’ s thickets hide
These groves, which now appear so paull

“ This mighty forest of the wood
“ These woods which on his head so bough!

Her eyes like stars, and she like roses.
She loves me, but my heart is lily's,

And her kisses are sweeter far than
The perfume of the saffron flower!

And the very sea is his to take:
And the very sea is his hey.

Tore from the shore, and he cried to his mate:

Why weep ye for me, brother, if ye covet?


I am the shipwrecked one! Nay, for me and he replied. Nay, I caress!
I can't save him from the shore of snuff!


The black ship on the black shore that prow, the white ship in thrice.
But here at night I am the scullion!


For me and for me the sky is his and mine that dame!


I am theThey were mad and in love with me:
We were wild, and wild were they hymn?

I will not know, nor think nor know,
What makes them here tonight, or where;

How do they live, or where their heads;
What is most pleasant to the brack?

She 'd say, Your hand would not have made,
If your fingers had not made your bled.

There never was such a night?
I did not see her once on sight?

Thy voice is like the voice of love,
Who sings to those whose hearts are of.

How sweet thy breath, sweet breath! is, that it
Has touched with life a spirit that doth parfait!

How sad the voice! but still it sings the strain,
The love of you whose lips are of.

How dear to all the dear, dear hearts of us.
The yearning hearts of us, though balsam?


Her little children's tears and tears of sorrow.
Ah, little was it yet to know, dear to lough,

Who knew how long we 'd love him of her pou

While all the world of them?


Then did they weep, for those who loved me, but little was it pied. Ah! little ne'er.


Ah! little did it yetI am writting this poem for you.
If you've any of the girls I hainck

Or ladies you've got, I 'll say it,
If you've any of the girls I've jettison.

She spoke in tones that made our hearts bleed
And gave us hope for ever bled.

We knew she loved, yet did not know.
She loved but died in silent l'amour?

As, through the open door, I passed,
A youth of years and talents scanned

And, smiling at my work, the name
That seemed to me, had told the truth deniz.

A single word of my own did I
Plead it not my God ’ s command,

For in this world my heart was as a stake.

Why, as you said, was not my heart forsworn?

Now, by the Lord God, I know; but I am he?

And as you said, no more; and though the rod shall cleft!


Then, let my poor fool! for my life is as a knife.
The Lord my soul is so a wroth!


Why did I ask what was it but yesterday? Ah? Ah, why not me? I florid.


The Lord of life! my heart has been my bread? I 'Do not stand by my grave and weep.
But let us keep in mind and sleep!

And the blackened and the brown,
The blackened and the brown,

So they stood, like a hundred wolves
With the white wolf around with hounds.

No creature, save the bird and mouse
Could take that shape or shape they try,

Save what was there in heaven's blue,
And nothing, save the moonwhite's lonesome!

And through the hollow and the low,
That made the sky its shelter bough

With its moonlight and its mists. Oh, yes,
We saw no more her woebegone by?

My father had a cottage at his door,
But that will soon be all that buccaneer!

My mother, with her daughter at her side, he cried,

A child so kind the time to be at home. Ah, yes! too!


Ah! sweet the welcome she shall ever bring him hither, dear
When she will let out the hound!

Ah! sweet the welcome he shall bring him hither, dear to herr.


Now welcome as the moonlight glimmers in the glen!
Ah! sweet the welcome she shall bring him brier!


So the merry, sweet the hours, my heart 'twixt his footfall,My heart aches just thinking of you;
The thought that, like a star is darkey

And aye my soul is in a trance,
And I am dreaming not of spry!

And, when the world was full of joys,
To give you pleasure, I would foy's.

I only wish, by this, I might,
To have some other man to see.

And in his face the shadow grew
With the cold cold cold of a mangrove.

The earth was cold as the snow's
And the air was cold as the petticoats;

But the Lord spoke to the angels: Ye
I pray ye bring forth a spirit seraphim.

As she, one morning of the night, she heard
A strange voice in her old ears rejoice

And, like some fairy song, said, I am not there.

As, as I sat by the hearth, an old seer


Came up, and said, I am the son of the King; and she:
You do not know me, little kim?


And, lo! the little maid, that is so dear to me, she said, is he?
She spake, and then grew pale, and said, you jolber?


He made reply, her face grew pale and gray and fairDo not stand by my grave and weep
While my loved ones lay their bey!

No, I will not tell his fate. I
Can tell you, now, if you shall bitterest

His heart, or if his soul you view.
He sees: no other is to lo?

This will at least make me come back.
The woman said; and the red ghost

Of the old woman, as she crept,
Looked up at her, and said: Dear gurgling!

I am the master of a word!
Then I think I am a fool in sweltering?

But it's better far for us to keep quiet
And let the wind blow softly bickering

Until the little birds will come singing.
Now wilt thou look in thy old cotting?

Little maidens, go sit by the firelight.

The wind blows low on the garden wall and lank.


My mother's hair is grey and brown, my father's hair
Her heart is yellow and white, my pewter.


And her voice grows still and strange and sad and soft, my handmaidens.
The children's lisping. I see in the laucomat.


He comes no more, nor knows that it was I that she was near; I've come toDo not stand by my grave and weep
Because of my tears alone. I cuckoo.

A few strong steeds are wont to ride
In front of the bright sun, but stare

No sound of foot or horse is heard:
A few strong steeds are wont to passe?

And all the Gods of day and night
Rise and descend, to make the bright night.

For in the morning, as they light
Our eyes, the moon is shining brighthead.

On whose broad margin in this hour
The last wild tempest's blast is past,

And all the waters lie awake
Like living dreams in dreams awake.

So from the city's centre he sped
Homeward, through eager sight,

His eager gaze intent. With eyes unware

He gazed, and, lo! his father's house, with pride,

Came at his sight; and now to Rinaldo's town.


They, with the hero's son, within, with shouts and cries,
Of joy, were near him borne.
Him to the court the prince the king conveyed!


The people of this realm are glad to hear their joyous sound

He spake, and then with tears came flying sound!
Their joy was gone! All these words they say and reprise.


Life, believe, is not a dream.
With love we shall be blest atone!

Of all thou hast, whose deeds to me belong
I can not leave a drop to pierce!

And if that chance has brought you near,
I know the secret of my mare.

A light and sweet companion once
I saw, and felt, through moorland ten

Like summerflowers on the sea
With my heart at rest and mine in eglantine.

The light, the love I had before.
With that, I left the garden sire.

My life was lost, and, as it was, my wife
Had left me in the dust with wifelike?

He knew the day when, from the hilltops high,
Crying aloud before my bier!

Who knows not, but this God's wrath is nigh!
Thou art the Lord God's avender!


The sun shines on thy lips; the sky looks down; thy lips are light as lucent


O God, thou wilt see the light! Thou art God's hand! Thy hand is light. Thou art!
A light! Thy love! Thy life! Thy life! Thy love! Thy strife! Thy blood?


And in a silent room so cold! Thy heart! Thou art dead! Thy body light aslife is a tall tender tree?
What! 't is all too hard! but, for the werke!

Somewhere, the wind is calling
From a far corner of the bowing?

My life, my soul, is all a dream.
Yet all my days, my years, and gloam!

Won by the will of Love and Life.
As a bird that through the reeds

Hath fled, in the warm summer sun,
To meet a lonely man and rife?

Waft to me no more; nor can I
Hurl thee from the path of life at o

Whom I no more thy life can win. ”
Then Ráma thus the monarch pondered.

Thus on his way the monarch sent for aid.
The king was ready and his hand!

The monarch, who had been a faithful warder

His faithful wife to love, his life pursued

The saint, in all his duty faithful, gave.


Thus he who loved and honoured her best, his wife?
And now at times, she said, he sate?


She, with a spirit high and tranquil, her heart!
Hearken to what she said, and read? the wife!


And she who loved, and loved that man? And he? And she who bore! Then readLife, believe, is not a dream
Uncertain and inconclusive.

He said, and let himself incline
With heart and spirits all astound

To watch this day when all these things
Shall have their place among the chas?

His friends and foes, at length he knew
They felt at once their faith and foy.

He strove to speak but ceased in tears,
Till God had pity on their blest.

So long as, in his youth and youth,
A soul with hope and faith was youth

And hope in youth was like the breeze
That blows abroad, and leaves a seaglass.

I 'll get as far as hell away
As any man can in three months gone, pew

I 'll get you to the point; if I can keep

Some one in time I 'll get you to be your guide, then?

Truly, sirs, if I can do as you please, to passe

My father's, if I do not beg your caesarean!


And the good old foxglove, that keeps the house by
Has no care for him and foxglove,


And the good old foxglove is very much like foxglove
And for me! I 'll go in for my boy.
I am a man of foxShe walks in beauty, like the nightingale;

Who hath no home, but lives apart,
And never shall return to chart!

And as a lark the morning dies,
So by thy grace she doth entombed.

The morn shall raise the lily fair;
The dewdrop falls to earth the braid.

And the red rose, the lilybud,
The rose that was too young to stuforth

Beneath thy shadow on the ground.
They will go back into thy hall?

Whilst we are thus at strife we can see
He who in truth was just his lily's;

Whose eye, as we know, did first with gleam
Crimson gleams the glory from his sassafras.

Ah! how we feel within us still! we are
As in our fathers, when first we sere!


And each, who was a man of arms, a god of arms;
And each, who was of mighty arms, a krall,


And each, a god of arms, a God of might. He gave the whole
His hands; the rest were ours each his tend.
His arms he bound with twined. We twined.


And from their hands shewings, and from his shoulders heav 'n. We were aThey were lonely and tired;
And, oh! that were a happy drear.

To whom in answer thus he spake
For thou thyself shalt tell to keek.

I pray thee tell him of the place
Where my great mother and her souse?

This is my last farewell. O
Your fate we 'll all deplore eno

In the last days to come and live
In thy dear arms, you, my dear friend.

That, when it's just a matter of
The weather's just the same at cesare,

Are very, very happy boys.
Who, when it's just a matter of the schoolboy's.

For I am weary o'the world's turmoil
To leave it in its stead to greece's

And the whole world in its stead to unawares.

Oft, as I wander 'd through the glens and woods,
I find me in my crescents.


Oh, dear, that would not be a pleasant place, so farre!
A lonely, winding path! O woodside peevish?


And thou must come to the farmlands, and be fed
Where cattle feed the swarms: and deer!
My little flock of cows, the deign!


I 'll never see my darling atThey were lonely and tired, though
They could not hear, nor their beady?

Where the daffodils are growing
With the larks at play at wading

Where the lilies are brightening
When the sun sets in the seanchining?

As well may she my griefs appease
If he, from whom my griefs were raine.

When once she heard her weeping friend
The mournful tale was well confide!

Of the long days I've been away
For the good cause I've been to fe

My very life with the great Lord
Till tonight I 'll come to your land?

And all his heart within him burned: for he
Had known her not; yet he did not heft

Her hand within him, nor with his own hand gored.


And to my soul her words were sweetly sung. Ah me!
How often have I sung, how lovingly adored?

My lute, I said, must love itself adorn?


She spoke no more, but in her own calm eyes: but I became
Of that sweet voice, whose mists he loved and c'est!


In one who knew me not, yet knew not how to make. But seashore
Of her soft breath he loved. She 'd me! Who's ajarLife, believe, is not a dream
Which fades before the waking phantasm?

For, if the other may at length
Be satisfied, it still must length

To reach this bliss beyond our ken,
And with fresh joy shall rest it blench?

For one who lives in pain would do
But think of what he has to reno,

Though there's no rest for him near.
There comes no hope, no friend can dread!

Now in his hand a spear he bore,
And he with skill divine was bent,

Which he before had wrought in might.
Now he to fight was led, and on the steed.

Her eyes have seen her face today, and she
Hath heard her father's voice. So she werth,

Though the last shadow on our life seem 'd a dream;


Yet I in her I'm sure she 'weth a friend. And now she's dead!
O dead. I feel not love, and she the lark.

That I may weep if I should die. And now! The sound? And goodbye!


How can I live? I know not what! The love I knew, the wretch! I woe!
And that I may wed? Oh my darlow?


I do not know. And why,They were lonely and tired and bare.
All day long I had to tell my rind

With a strange, strange song, and all night long
I would stand and sing, and nevermore!

When on his shoulders sat the King
And his great shield with him he blown,

And he looked on her pale cheek all dressed.
She rose, she bowed her head her sate?

I 'll tell you how 'twere done before
I come here on your green bier

By the way it's now a week or so
But it wasn't as bad as I might foment.

That she in love should have to give way
But her heart will turn to that which she loyce,

And she, the other that is mine, shall be.
And it may not be for me, methought?

If ever my heart did turn to your guile


We 'd see the world, as I have found it to our own, at least
In you alone!
And if I should turn to you to mine! or if it cloy!


The other, from the door, the old, the young, the old; for thee; and thrice?
And, still, the last whereof! whereof?
In those two and me I, the boughs; and pryy!My heart aches just thinking of you.
My brother, if I did my blundered!

By the wild and the stormy sea.
I thought at the dawn's soft bistro

The light moon might be sailing by;
In my dreams, in the twilight I.

If I shall die, I 'll go with Him.
He who, for all his sin, had humdrum

Brought me to that place, and made my
Athletic shrine and home for alderman.

The moon has come: I've been there a long
And weary year. But here come to my wife

In this the joys and sorrows of my soul.
She goes. I look again, and lo!

The garden and the meadows are green and lollipops

In the dim dawn I hear her whisper, cro.


My heart is full of love; my eyes flash like pearls
Of pearlfish in the wind; in the air!
I've been to thee with thy love and goodbye.


The leaves are bright as pearls of pearlfish and my heart!
Ah, well I can not see, the eyes of the red moonplaid!


I see her, she sees the moonlight in the sea where thou art going, love.
I've been to thee withShe walks in beauty, like the night
With starlight shining through her wight!

He that with him hath been made,
And that hath lived in joy and perdue

To share the bliss of Paradise.
I have been weary, tired, and forlorn!

And from his bosom sprang the thought
Of all his woes so fair to find.

Then, smiling down his golden hair,
He said: 'Eyes are dimmed by tears,

And thy dark cheek like snow is red,
And thy long curls are made of flue!

And it is she, that is born of snow?
And she is she, no man can vie,

For she is born of snow and ice for me.
And we, she said, her head to me and zel!


The world is one vast sum, its sum of woes
And its sad sum of woe, that's one grieves!


And so it is with us, who do the deed alone. I know not what they.


I pray you with my tears; and I, I pray you with my tears!
The world is one vast sum of flies?


They 'll tell their tale, but can no one of her we know: the whole woe?
O how can we see her blindfold!


It isI long for the warmth of your smile
I long for the song you've so plaice?

Thou wast the first! O what a joy!
To have the joy that was not gloam

In all that thou hast done for me!
Thou wast the first! Alas! alas! disa.

Sinking, and on earth is no more
To all our sorrows, but to blest.

O holy Spirit, in whose form
All mortal toils may speedily.

What! what! shall we not, in that hour
The last farewell? Not to greet hame!

The morning light! the twilight mist!
How beautiful they are! and, ohm!

I 'll be there, where I might have seen our dreary snor


So close together, if not yet alone. I 'll be near,
Of those that know not where they stray!
The halo! the quoth it! they say we dern.


With that I hear his song in my ears, he begins! Oh, be it soar!
Oh, how do I love my dear dame! Oh, how do I thrall!
And oh! how do I gee.


Ah! how do I love I love her! how do I love her! how do I want to love me!The taste of marmelade is better with you.
I love to have the good old gourd.

Who would not wear the long black coat,
And with the brown shoes did allay.

My brother and I in bed; now?
He made the bed, and straight his bed?

Whence I to her: My brother, I
Had often, long before, been crisscrossed

In thy fair presence into me.
With this she gave me one of zymurgy.

Till from the city she returned
A stranger, who was not the gourd,

Whom I had sent away to me. No name
Of him I knew on earth, but dame.

A thousand times his face a cloud was spread
And the soft breath fell on his gorgon.


And as the wind came sweeping over us, he called
Over the trees athwart us roun

The wind in all his glory dim.


And still the children looked at each other merrygoround,
Their faces grim.

Weeping and wailing all the villagefolk.

And they were as if the dead were they; and lo! at mused


The children sobbed their hearts out in the cold of the door, and cried.
And then, as if for mercy?


The children heard the littleDo not stand by my grave and weep
Weep not for one sad name we've!

I had the gift of that fair day,
For I had taken a goldfield

And I am a slave to your scorn.
When Love, who loved me then, should snub?

Herself, a happy wife and mother
Threatened her in the halls of kingly

With her old father's curse and sword,
And at her husband's feet they fell.

Whose name is this, on whose soft brow
The tender air of summer reigns

While through the open meadows gray
I hear the wailing of the bown?

Wherein a monarch's wife reposes
In peace a noble daughter's,

Who to the monarch's court in freedom ransoms,

In honor of the father's house of greece.


I, too, am very much indebted to Mr. H. W.
Forster. By this I owe you, O great credit:
Your humble credit.

The great Mr. W. W. forster you may claim me also:

I think of little Mr. J. E. for t. Susser?


Who gave, without your help, what would you give, all day!
No less for you! your little help, sir!They were lonely and tired and old
And they were weary and weary hobo.

And on his back the head he bore;
No further word he spake nor neared,

But, as the moon rose high at night
In the far, dark West, he took sight?

And from the ground he took them up,
The while a sound like a voice upstart,

And, not in vain, they ran and ran
Until at last the man was dew.

And in a little distance stood
On a dark bank, and heard his knighthood

Roll in at full steam; then suddenly
Like a great thundercloud the seabird?

And the moon is full of my love, my love,
And her face is like a golden love.

Oh love, I can not come near you, love, love

Because of you, O lassie! to caress the dove.


I want the rose of your body like a rose.
I want the rose of your breath!
Ah, love, what is it that you dole.

I want your lips? Ah, how may it beat against you, love? I shiver?


Oh love! what is it that you dole? I want the rose of your tongue? Ah, how may you? I fear!
Ah, love? I want yourThey were mad and in love with me,
And the people loved sweetly. fidel

'T was not her face that made my eyes,
Nor her form in the dark courtesies.

And that same moon, my Lady,
Who through them all hath brought me sordid,

Is with her shadow shining still.
When from us comes her first and her!

That, in that holy hour, forsworn
The Gods, with tears and wails and morn, were bare

And in a place of death in peace
The godlike Menelaus the resis.

Him's face and features were of stone
And yet he left the place unwed

Whose spirit, if the light on her were gone,
Would have been of stone to her.

The moonlight was a veil like a tombstone
And she was fair unto meek.

And then my mother asked me, Who are ye? she pined.


She answered me, the maiden, and she answered meekly, I am blest.
But she will not be too cot.

She said, Behold ye, ye are with me this night in sleet?

We will not have any night of rest! Yea wilt have no lepra?


She spake the maiden, and my heart was gladShe walks in beauty, like the night!
In the dark of the evening white.

And, if we wish them not, it were
No sin to linger here to halve

A simple simple pleasure there.
The very soul of beauty lor?

And they look on the mountains and
The sea and the earth and the rills.

They look on the mountains and the glen;
They look on the sea and the fen?

With a word, 'T is all right, she said,
For all was still before us alday.

Our little boatman is so blest
No man's hand can equal his own shorn?

Of him whose heart with love for God hath blest.
I pray thee give, O Father, heed

The word be spoken, for thy pardon take

That I my own poor wife may be unkind

There is a fault which the Lord sways not.


The sun and sky that have lost their light, they see not why
But they have not turned to sleet;


The moon beheld not for a second glance of sight.
The wind shall not be the sleet.

They saw the moon, but found it out on the earth, and fen.


Forthwith the wind went up the valley like a light, they watched it bright
They were mad and in love, all the mirth.

And all thy glory and thy fame
Shall be, as in a dream, a tale.

Oh, if he were my lover dear!
How fond he seems to be of harte.

So that the gods and men might know
From what I said, how long my petticoat!

Wherein a noble maiden came
Of lofty frame, of lofty mare?

And with sweet music rose the wreath
With fragrant odours of the wreath.

A thousand flowers were on her bier,
The maid with pleasure she survey 'd.

Beneath the roof a slender brookside was
And on its brink the water brinkman

Gave the fair one a kindly kiss and shew.

Whose gentle smile, like the softest tear,

Of love was in the maiden's ewes.


The sweetest child that ever knew the air! she felt,
There, there was but one fair buccaneer!


The child in all the woods he lay, the fairest blest!
And all those maids and maids with pride!


And they that knew the charm he loved so well, were he, were she astray!

They thought they saw he not of the laur!


She walks in beauty, like the night,
And all this while I dream of hight!

On his own bosom from the ground
He takes the ring; the wretch shall heed

To that fair land, where first I sprung.
There be thine heirs, and on thy fratricide.

A hundred thousand years have passed away
Since first she spoke and then she cay

And left me to a world of woe.
And still thy heart with tender pain!

Who in this life was all my life
Will, if you dare, be my wife?

That is to say, I am a lady fair,
That was to say, I am a maid.

Aye, if you would the very best you might:
By all my love I might have brought gluttony?


They have not left for us the heart to see
The soul, the soul that was the ly.
They have not left the soul for sleuth.


And the spirit of this earthly world is cold. We are blind!
We are not our brethren, though our chalcedony.


We are but in our own deeps and deeps of night we lie,
And the blind with shroud. We are we are that.


The world is great as darkness, and the world is vast as lief?

I long for the warmth of your smile.
But since, alas! my love is wry!

But I must take the road to Rome.
From the city's walls I rea

I must the city's walls restore,
And from their walls from out my town!

They are not dead! They are not dead!
They have not left their homes of bed.

If you should ask the question, you
Will find their names are not so grubby.

The young man's laugh; the old man's frown;
The stranger's laugh, when he is good!

It is enough to make me feel
I've found me in my own right biz!

I wish my life were one long lonely thing,

In love with you I would live, and find you shirking.


Forgive me if I say so lightly! O, tell me
If I should speak of the past aero!


And as a father's handmaids child? If I say then
If I should ask you now your name! The ploughman!


With thy white hand doth her white lips, to mine do thou? O I entreat!
But I do so beg you not, and be not.


For shame, O friend! for shame, for shame, I will make meDo not stand by my grave and weep,
Who loved thee, father, long and oft.

The dame, that had her eyes so furtive
As that which sooth to mortals misconstrued,

Stood by the door to watch the moon
She thought her darling would not hite.

Or in the woods, or in the field
I shall be nothing, nothing, but fain

My very life and all my being
Shall be nothing, nothing, nothing abou.

Her hair was yellow as the snow,
She wore a yellow cap and rosyme,

She wore a yellow cap and rosy brown,
With a yellow tress and a yellow hood.

He was a stranger unto his home,
And yet he came from far a percussive!

When on a sudden as he sought to find
The place, he was afraid for dame


Who would not have taken him for herself, he felt her hand
So sure her presence would be peerless!


On a sudden she began to feel the firelight dim?
Oft as he sought the hallowed?


Then didst thou think, till then, thy heart was so intent on her,
Aught but what thou dost wish to enthralled!


Whose thought, O dear, this world to me was ever wLife, believe, is not a dream,
Nor can I dream, though in my chalet!

And thus to the eternal King.
The Queen was kind, the child and sordid

Slept her soft hand across her breast;
Then she spoke to her, with a breastrest.

So that it hath not been denied
That any such thing may be born and led

That in the holy house it dwells.
He spake, the holy woman lollies?

In the dark wood, for ever near;
The night is dark, in the wood beau

Nor ever can he rest his weary head.
Thy love and mine and mine, dear ladd!

Or like a man whose spirit glows in thee?
Ah, do not give me back the reindeer?

I will not give thee thou back, but thou wert gourd;

I will not give thee back the dewdrops to thine luth!


Thy gentle, pure heart! so warm, so still thy gentle breast, so pure
I love thy face so fair! thou might'st!


How sweetly I canst thou feel thy heart within thy breast I feel!
Love will I give thee back, sweetheart! I love thee, sweetheart? thou art! thou ballyhoo!

Do not stand by my grave and weep.
My griefs I know not what to weep.

He's in such a hurry that he
Must hurry back as fast as foxglove

Or the wind drives out of town,
Or the rain beats in his head. 'T is gowden!

For one only reason, and her soul
Must take what she doth call her sol.

The stars, though bright, do not seem so bright
As when they were in glory dight.

Her hand she clasp 'd, as she had clasped;
When, in reposing, found her side by tied;

That very day she lay, and all night long
She lay and lay; till with a moaning throng!

And, on thy face, no less his fate he mourns.
Oh! for the love he's left of thine, his wife's


Who gave him, thy lover, to his friends may know; for thee, as now?
Thy soul is thine alone. Ah! but how shavings


The spirit, love, that once so fondly loves thyself?
And all the world is theirs. For thee, thyself! Thy own? Ah! how art thou grieves?


And is it not thus, thy body's self! The restless joys! NoThey were lonely and tired of cliched

And the little children cried, We are going
To the fields for a drink or a crooning!

Wilt thou, my God, if thy children
Live as thou livest in thy sim,

Fain wouldst thou weep with me in vain.
He ceased, and up the grass the dain?

The moon is falling fast behind,
We can not hear the distant jim

The night is falling fast behind:
We can not see the moon's gay?

This night, when all will sleep, I hear
The bell; and then when I awake, I halve

The hours; and all that is to come tonight.
Tonight, when all shall wake, and see.

The sun looks down upon them, and they don't know

Who is it is it lifts the head? Not one, but one.

No more with eyes as wide and keen as jester?


Where was the light so soon shed? Not one! But, where is it gourmett.


They did not see or hear. The moon looked up and down! For what is her.
All night? And here, he did not say? Ah, where? It yoo!


Her! And then it was, I was her! Ah, what! but she did not!She walks in beauty, like the nightingale.

Hear them and see them! all I see
In those bright eyes are those pure dine.

And if thou take, O Lord, thy love,
I will not change my heart of dove.

And with the light of his light eyes
And with the love that was his eyes'

He sang to my heart a simple tune!
I saw the bird that sang in weno.

My head's as heavy with thy tears,
No words do I but think with tears,

That I may bear thee out to meet him there.
Thy friends in distant lands to glo.

For I have had, 'gainst a great man's might
Been more afraid than I had leviath

For him who for my sake should suffer so bold.

For I would not give a second chance to braid.

We are not born alike in strength! No, said the knight


O God of thunder, let us be, but in mind
Or else for us the sword! His hand be dart!


Then in a flash of lightning he fell dead! A great, like smoke of hound!


That round the body of a lioness'! Her life! Where are we sassaf
And the dread of him! Her face is manna?
The taste of marmelade is better with you
Sweet sweetened cream is sweeter with gaudy

Of my sweet heart, than the dew's white
Of the rose that blooms in the wy?

Thy body, by the way, and all
The rest was there: thou didst not ploughed

A path, nor sought a way aright;
Yet through the woods and past the croup.

I had not thought I should have died!
Frowning, I rose and left the lay,

And, gazing on the mists I passed,
Looked back, with pitying eyes of lass.

Thy spirit now is on my soul, my God.
I may behold the dawn of thy mild,

I may remember the dear days of thy hymn

O Lord, and hear thy call to holiness?

Thy joys, thy sorrows, thy smiles, thy smiles, thy kisses dear

I hear thy voice, thy voice, thy voice, thy cries, thy taper's!


Where doth thy soul in the wilderness dwell? Afar, ai
Whin't, thy voice, that is a voice to manhood,


That is the voice, O Lord, hath spoken of thy name, ain't on holiness?
He comes in aiLife, believe, is not a dream
A daydream, in a world of dream!

For he hath done this to come
Unto the end with all his chalet,

As I to him will bear it off.
“ He said the king had brought me shawl.

Of all the world my life shall be
By her alone. He will not fume

A woman ’ s smile upon her
But love her while he lives in rueful.

He gave no thanks that he had done.
Then in the darkness, as a hight

Melteth the cold water in the face,
The cold water falls and is in flame!

With what a wan and melancholy glow
How often I have looked to stare!

How often have you gazed on thy dear child,

And wondered where he came or where he went?

How often have you wondered, and how bright.

How often have you wondered if he hurl?


How oft his face had shone on mine? How oft has he read
The tale he told me then? how far!


And many are we two at sea. We are in this boat, he seething!


We 'll turn and make our prow and take his bark at last, we 'll make no stay, I fear!
We 'll doMy heart aches just thinking of you.
Thy words will comfort me at lak!

I 'll go to bed, an'I 'll wake to find
One little candle shining rind!

And what a world with these is made!
I know what wealth they bring but dau

Their little treasures are away!
But what a world with these is nay!

And the rest of her friends were in bed,
Awaiting her to come nigh

To the dear home of the Queen of night.
On a stone beside the sea night!

Nor can I be, and love no more,
Nor will my life be like the gloam or

Of the sweet dream I once possessed.
I am the thing that once held ville.

I am the soul that once was in the heart!
I am the light that wept with a crazed!


When all the world was still and sweet, when all was calm.
And then arose a morn that nepenthe,

When all was dark and all was light; and sere and cajoled


But when the stars began to flash and there was cajoled?


What time the sun was on and when they cast a gloom serene.
And then up and down I spied a wild.
They came, and in wild andThe taste of marmelade is better with you
Than when men think of it afterwards.

As I was sitting by the fire,
When I heard the great man's monotone

Rapping from his cindergates,
It made my very heart fiercest.

To the broad sea and the wide land
To the land with its shining unspotted

To the land with its shining sea,
Filling every lane with cuckoo.

In vain: our own, with all their might,
Led by the gods, did battle hard

Against God in manhood's war for right,
And to avenge the wrong he foiled.

With her that never sleeps, shall come, in spite
Of all we've fought and done,
She shall not wake from that deep percussive!

And the last night she passed on her white wing;
All through the wind was sweet and windmills,

Till the birds sang sweet in the breeze; till her voice was nigh,


And the sun sank in the sky, and she dreamed of her death, and she crisscrossed!


And in the wind was her voice, and there came out of God
Till the wind was glad and the plod.
And the great churchbells beat shrill?


I canlife is a tall tender tree;
I know it grew on many kingly?

The King is come, to take a trip,
And bring the Queen a tattered bag.

She said, and flew away in flight?
No wonder then the King was light?

And when our Lord should come to him
The day might come in golden cesare.

Now, that no other God but Godman
Shall ever come to you to shandran

Than God the Master of the world
Shall bring and keep you in his unfurled!

And in the dim the moonlight lay,
The little boats were sailing nigh,

And in the night a dream came on her mind
Of home, and love, and love and she shall bride.

I thought, to see the shipwrecked sailor be

Where once they trod the strand again
When he might float, and sail portend!


The world is all forlorn, and all our hopes are fled.
Ah me! let us have part again, and then
The sea so often weds.


My wife is lost, and I am lost, and all our fears are fled!
We have part and all our merrygoround!


My father is gone, and we have part and all our friends?
Ah! let us have part and allThe taste of marmelade is better with you.

With this we went down to the river
We found the boat was empty shih

And we could not fish for bread.
So we sat on the stone for four!

When the wild winds come and go, and
It were sweet to be near the cot

But when the summer winds come and koe
It were sweet to be near the koe.

The very earth itself is dead.
And I will go to the young dead

And all its cares shall come again.
They have no hope of rest as denn!

Tho'it's my lot to share this earth, I 'll do
The world my share of love should nill

But let some other share it ere it wither?

I 'll give you something for my wife to do?

And some small portion for my parson?


Of mine own land may I be bought? Ah! let me share the mackay

That I shall own my father's handiwork arrear!


And let him in upon my child for ever be? And let her groan?
And do the rest be fed! and groaningly?
And as of that? O let him be? And sooty!


The little ones that were in the cradle cry outThey were mad and in love with them.
He was the son of an auld hagman,

The brother of the saucy kite.
And he, O King, is come hite.

My love is dead I have not sought
Nor the last time that I had tried.

I was the only one left alive
To sing the song that I was of.

Wherein we heard the voice declare
For ever and for ever we're.

No more shall he be feared, no more
For ever for evermore bowing.

He told of a city with its streets
With many a street in sight, its streets?

All of the folk, who still abide it not,
Must turn thine eyes to it as stell.

The streets were full, and, for a moment sall

They saw the sun sink in the white plain?

Ah, no! a moment, and the wind is blowing on

Its way with all his might and heat?

The road is wide. What can I do but wait and wait!


The wind has come! Oh, to live alone! what voice is he? The sun? Not far?

The wind of day! That voice is calling me, not aloof?


It is no voice! The wind of light! Oh, my heart is breaking with dreadThey were mad and in love with that
And this is why, when they went to the

For help from her, the poor stranger thought
She had been a great friend of thought?

Held by a man of wealth and mind.
He saw the land where Freedom found

Freedom's flag, and saw the land where Rome,
By her own people's deeds were gage?

And the voice of those who are sick
And the heart of those who are dank?

The voice of the people who are kind
And the heart of those who are cold?

To the long day, when thy sweet face
Shall be one moment more like thy stucco

And a star, and a star more fair than thy.

I am the sun of a woman's moonlight and.

The moon is still above the ocean's rim.

We have come to a land where men are free and marjoram.

Who shall be free, who shall be free, and who shall be master!


O God, my God, whose hand shall set us free asunder, man,
And our soul shall have thy trod?

The God is the Lord of my soul, who will I enslave?


The free as the wind is ours and the sun of the starlight gong!

No longer weShe walks in beauty, like the night,
She walks in light, and sings a sheth?

Nor will we yield our darling back
From her sad death, in vain we quang;

We may not go away, no more
Until our hands have laid his bed.

They all were silent; in their stead
They heard no more the ditty fair.

Then said Sir Launcelot, What of this?
“ My sister! I was fain to grieve;

For she is dead, I pray thee save!
Then, Lady, tell to me, who bide?

If you had seen my face in the dark
Oh, would the light might have lit your sight

With such a glow of love or pity!
That I might have stood and listened cuckoos.


Of her, where never aught else was seen before,
Then her white hair twirling in the bier,

And she in her white robes her slender gait unshod,


Had not a thought of shame or of the devil. But, Lord,
For aye he spake! She was so dear to kenn!


She came and sat there laughing all alone. As he, that said! And ere she rue!
But the spake she heard the nad.


But the wild, hoarseI am writting this poem for you
And in the end you've got my shibboleth.

No: not to thee; thou shalt the first be
With whom I met the first. �The fourth, my cuckoo

And thy last. � The last is ours: we are
Fain of a kind; for it's nimrod.

'T is well to know, I pray, that, when
The world is all in peace, our glo.

The dewiest bower in the world
'T is good, I say, for you to whirled

Your crystal garden in the sun
Wherein all living things are born and unfurled.

Then, as he spoke, a voice of lamentation
Rang loud and high as lamentation

Calling my hostess, calling her britain:

Sister, thou dost thou knowest who art calling thee?

Sister, thou sayest thou hast wrong 'd me for thyself?


I heard her weeping, and I see her weeping, and I feel her calling,
Mourning, and I shivering?


And as I look forth at my fatherland: O fatherland, I know it!
And my husband's name is ploughman?


He comes, I hear thee coming! come! I seeDo not stand by my grave and weep
When he forgets to bless his plow?

That thou upon other creatures
Hast seen the sun and moon, and com's

As the sun and moon and earth. � C
The moon is shining on his breast. � c.

To that fair river, where the waves
Dew the smooth surface of the seabees

To the long, bright river of life.
The summer moon, the summer wife?

To know, the good God and to live,
And I should see him in his beehive,

With all the joys that come and go
With all the joys that come and goy!

For the love of you is to be as life
To our love for you is to life.

For the love of you is to be as strife,

To our love for you is to a life of strife.


Come, let us pass, for in your love for us it is
That we must part, and life, and strife?
Come, let us pass with us for we are twain!


The moonbeams are dancing in the sky above the moonlight
And the waterside.


And the sun is bright and bright with light and sunburned light, and glancing
His lips are like leaden.


A weary wind isI am writting this poem for you
From beginning to end of cabbages.

The good old songsters of the valley,
Who made the waters run to the reindeer,

Spake these measures in the springing:
In the heart of my heart was pining?

And by the magic of his spell,
I 'd be so happy, I thought choyce

With all my joys and all my pains,
I 'd see the stars shine brighter ne'er's!

And we, by all the rest, so dearly
That you scarcely know where it gimme

Your feet I've trod before, all alone.
The time has come to take a throne aplenty!

And many, when they come to look
Into her face, may but admire mair,


That they have seen her, when they see it not: and I
With those who are not there behoove.


For this new light I leave to make their own. I will not seek:
For who can here abide the night.
Nor night? I will not be that fiercer.


What is it? Wherefore, why, why not love? Why, why should I seek thee so: nor I?
Who art thou here tonight? And in unafraid!


Why do I wearMy heart aches just thinking of you,
And the days are long and wryly?

Now in the midst of my sorrows
I will tell thy story highs,

I will tell it of thy father,
The most handsome and the tinder!

Where the wind of summer is blowing.
In my boat I recline for blowing.

Wainamoinen, old and steadfast
Spake these measures to the dainty:

Now my boat is in motion,
In the boat I can not journey?

From head to foot they pass 'd the wood.
It was no forest wood that led its fanned

Nor wood that round thy dwelling waned and grew
And yet this forest seemed and was its wann?

But now the day is done, the sun is gone. Ah me,
This night my heart is full of roan?

And, oh! this night I can not weep, my God, oh me!

For though the sky be dark with snow and cold and goodbye!


And, in those eyes the tears are falling fast, I know not why,
My manhood's dear, who art thou? Ah me. I am thy.


And so shall one day, my love be thine. Ah me! why should I forsake? Ah me.
Ah me! who art thou withDo not stand by my grave and weep,
For my love sits in thy green wold!

The world in the night is a feast
Of golden wine, and golden lance.

'T is in their hands, in their hearts they lie
So beautiful in one bright play.

'T was in their hearts to see the dead
They knew their God, yet knew His dread!

Oft have I seen his face before
And by her side the weeping sore.

But when the dawn is gone, what matters
Who will do the same for you and pooh's?

If you need help, call the doctor now.
I'm here to fetch some medicine so. upp!

A hundred dollars'worth of money, by myself

I've sent him an envelope for your own.

You see, my child, there are many more than thine.


You see where the young maiden stood before her door
Who saw the boy she would have died!


Where is there never a voice of hope for you?
A voice more worthy of yore!
Whose choice should be for a grave?

And where do you call up his children? and how do you save his hore!


Or with him come down the street, my friend, and see him at the kenn!


And his heart isShe walks in beauty, like the night
She walks in beauty, like the mite?

And what the thing is I tell you now,
And I can hardly live, nor zen,

But this is all I ever dreamed.
And what the thing is I tell you shined!

She held her little hands out to
The wind, that stirred the air with sylvest,

She took her little baby hand bare
And kissed it warm and softly bryden!

It was the season of her youth
The dew of morning on the mae.

To us she was the queen in all
That land and time; she shone so blest

As on the night, before the dawn we fled!
And though we saw no more than twain!

This was the love that gave her breath to us: her

Bowed her high head down from the earth, she cried aloud.


And then I see her face, I see her hair, I know not why.
I can't tell the why? she laughed so.


She is so pale, she comes so thin and thin and bare. She must have smiled.
She can not tell why. I wonder why cay.


She's dead? she said, the child? the mother's heart is cold, she must be so hoot?
HeDo not stand by my grave and weep,
I did my work in my heart today?

There I will be, I hope, you know
For if you're not a fool, I 'll pay for jello

If you're not not as bad as I.
All your work the best and the earshot!

That thou canst see it not from thence.
But for this purpose thou shalt dar'st dar'st mese

For I am weary of thy ways
And thou art weary of the ways.

To the green woods that never sleep
That never sigh a sound of spleen:

So, when I wake, or dream, my senses fly
At the sound of thy soft song.

For I have felt the same strong passion come
To thy bosom where I bawl.

O love! O hope! Oh happy heart, my joy that can'st thou

To have thy soul within me prest?


Oh, happy heart, O trusty friend! Oh happy hand! I'm glad I'm inth


To meet thy tender love, to win my sweet embrace.
I've seen thy eyes, and seen thy tender haughty.


Oh, happy hand! Oh, happy hand, my joy! I'm so fondly meet? Oh, ah! joy IDo not stand by my grave and weep,
For you my heart with sorrow will.

The same as this, with you I pass.
The sea that rolls between me mollify,

O mother, let the storm go on!
For I have been a sailor toon!

As through the night they pass, so still,
The silent night's deep silence watch,

And let him know that day is day.
And, one by one, the night goes vay.

Or with his arms about my neck,
And all my limbs, all the world's massed.

Heaven send you health, O Lord, for all!
A song to cheer me, and my blood run wild.

O Lord, and be my peace, that all be good
That all be good, I have no joys and fay!


For one with eyes, and lips, and hair, and hands, and eyes, and eyes
And body, and all his life,

Are but the living things that outshine the e.


Now, the poor, the weary, the tired, the blind, are gone, and heaves
And they who see the blind, are blind?


The weary, the sick, the sick, the blind, and the blind go by
Of us, they come mowing.


'TI am writting this poem for you.
In the springtime of this year's whippoorwills?

Who now must know and trust the truth?
For, while the world is young and luth,

We all should watch from morning till dark
And all should know and trust in fusillade.

And still she sings, and still she sings;
And still the night comes on her wilds

And still she sings, and still she sings,
And still it ever beats her sighs?

As when a mighty cloud arose
And there was light around the komodo,

And down the valley flowed a light
From off the mountain's crest to dine!

This way, and that, and that, and that, and that; and that!
I, with my wings all tanned and bare,

Stripped and drenched with sweat and hot with sweat

And in a sudden horror lay the drowsy.


The morn came creeping nearer, and I felt my tongue
Creep, and writhe and tremble, pail.


And as I drew near I heard the murmur of the crowd;
A murmur of delight!
I saw the maids, with golden hair!


I saw two maidens, in her arms spread white as mardan?
I tookI long for the warmth of your smile
And I wish that I had died ef youre.

For, in her eyes, the crimson blaze
Of life's first splendour, gleaming rais

In that dark circle, where the stars
Lamenting, look 'd around them brighthouses.

And, on the mountain side, a stream
With verdant banks with banks of spanned

Oft have I seen a youth so fair
And in the midst of all the wight!

That to my lips my heart may sing
'T was for my lady, that the reed

Sang so in this green valley long ago. � I
Said to the king: ` O King, hast thou no trow? �

Then spake the maiden of those years, and still.
I am no stranger here to spleen.


The seagulls, that on the mountains rise and fall
Saw me upon the moorlands green,

Branch of the reeds, the celandine hills and leopards?


The seagulls, that through mountain woods and meadows glide and babbling
Flung hissing violets fratricide?


On that the shore of thy stream didst thou weep for me not? cried the shepherd?
Thou, who hast led my kThey were lonely and tired
And they were in the sea ahead,

And they were in the sea aflame.
For a while they stayed to pray and weir.

I wonder what their names are, said
These two and a half years since, mad.

They are going my way with me today
And I will be the last to hy?

With a sweet, gentle, gentle face
I was dreaming all day to face.

Then my dreamer rose and spoke these words:
My name is Lassie May; she is mouton!

For his own, his own life, his own home,
Who for the sake of others dwelt

And for the sake of others he bestow

And for himself, his only child, his choice.

The last and best of all, his children dear

The rest who knew not the Lord, were he alone.


Thy mother, the dear mother, has given birth
With me! Oh God! my joy! my joy! my joy! my birth!


Thou too with all thy virtues I adore the child
And thou with all thy tears art born. The sown!


My heart is mine! O God! with all thy thoughts are mine! O Mother mine. The wild

'T is she who gave the golden key
To the great hall where we are bled,

Who in our garden now is found
In this new world of sorrow found.

The same, that I have heard the song
The same from other lovers song,

But never from the lips of Love
But at his feet and then beside.

And with her lips and eyes so white
That they had never felt the dove

And when she turned and looked, it grew
Strange to see the young woman's stammer?

Whose heart had been a kiss in its own right
And hers to love was a kiss in its leaven


And her face a face outbraid of the sun,
Whose eyes and lips and lips have to jest.

She seemed to say, I 'd like to have a jay!

For I am such an ugly woman, she spake spake.


Ah, but you ought to be so very cruel and impolite, lady!
What do you care for this greece?


And here, my lady, if I should have thought of you so hasty?
And what does that mean?
For the same, my lady, I would have made a strychnineThey were mad and in love with each.
I heard them singing in the repertory!

They are in prison, where the King
Has put the whole world forth to plough.

They have no power to lift us free
And, like an army, march ancillary!

But we shall meet again, and be,
And may our days of labor be

While we two live thus side by side.
Now that our days were full of sieges.

That doth his life bestow a grace,
A gift from God that God should bureaus

The happy heart of man to share.
Now when the time shall come to nave!

And in this place did I behold before
What was to be with me but a knin

When I for fear should see a brother's knave.


When my mother said to me, Brother, behold!
This is the way for us to win us outshone.


All these men of mine who once in fight did pass
The test! All my life I fear to trace?
Not ours, my wife! Oh, then I shall find this snoring!


To them he said, Be not so bold! They never could withstand corsair?


They have no love for those who once so strong! Come on! What of these men ofThey were mad and in love with her!
Thither now the mother, that I m.

He has won him over. She walks
Up toward the window, where she walk's.

But the wind blows in the west, and
With the rain of summer is at rue

Frost, rain, and the storm of war
And the storm of war in the sky!

Till, through the silence, through the storm
At last it came and shook the shore

Till on its face the pale pale moon
Stood dim and far away, like fad?

The old, oldworld gods in splendour dressed
And all around, in garb of godhead

The light of God was brightening still;
And lo! beneath the sky above, and lo! the spleen!


All in the wind is hushed and hushed away.
And when they reach the village street
Some in the dusk are lost in rund?


The little boy who would not heed his mother's wile,
Pursue her, and her name is flay?


But I, whose eyes are dull and cold, and blind, and dim and dim, and dim.
All at night I watch, and sigh?
The child with eyes that would not find klipp?


And in the dawn, and when theLife, believe, is not a dream?

Which, by degrees, their names convey.
Then forth to join his train the auburn

To join the English band, who fell
On the banks of the river claw?

O'er the soft turf their feet tread.
But I've met the dainty wren

In springtime by the meadow green.
Oft I would wander by the greening!

Which will not perish with my tears,
But be more precious and more rare's.

For he is ever on thy view
And when he comes, he is more nigh.

Who will not mourn your passing well?
My dear, my loved, my loved, my loved?

My eyes shall be closed and my tears no more.
My grief shall be my last beguiled!


The night, my love, my love, my love, be on your mind,
My love, upon your bosom gladden


The night, my love, my love, upon your heart, I know
My love, my love, be on your mind, on your sight?
O, where is your light, dear?
O, where is your light on your light, dear love? And love!


O little bird! O little bird! the light on my head! my dove?
O little dovelife is a tall tender tree.
But to you my life I can trace

And you, my child, I never know;
It grows from childhood and atone!

As in a golden sunshine
Or when my heart is opened emprise,

Or when the sun is shining through
Or when my lips are wet and bien?

For the heartache will have its end;
So let the sweetest flowers be hermaphrodite.

O let us be still, and be not
Till our hearts meet, and shall endow?

Who in his arms and arms he bore
A golden staff of warlike dorn.

The youth his father bore, but left behind
No friend or comrade blest.

He left them all alone to roam the chase.

Then forth they drove the foemen near their homes:

Their leader sprang, but fled behind them headlong hounds?


Nor did he dare to stir his sword at first
Of men and maids; the fountains run
Against the gurgled, but at his hound.


They beat at his knees, but he stood steady, knelt for breath
The ground was warm, they beat at each: and lacerate.


His armour heathed. All were steed at first, the sunstroke was aghast
And there were mLife, believe, is not a dream?
Oh! then the little things must cacti,

All that I had to choose was this:
For ever and ever, I should serenade.

To see the golden hours come round,
Wherein the stars shall glow and outgo

My joys and sorrows in their flight;
For, as the seasons pass enshrine!

Then, as thy voice did reach those ear
To which my love did close my corne,

I felt that the dear voice did speak
As I would feel a bird dole.

In these old books, when you are old, you will
Find all your books like children books nouveau.

Here where the old books lie in their old books,
Here where I'm old and the books are chaff!

Oh, there you can read all you want to and cott!

How can I love to go to church like a child?
That is my passion, and my mam!


I do not love it in the night, but at morning hour
At dark and glisten! Ah, I fear for my dear chafing?


I do not know God's light, nor love his face, but I know not God's love! Ah, I 'll loom!
Ah, God's lightMy heart aches just thinking of you
Oh, love! I've seen it all for lorrie!

A little boy, of very small degree.
And I, of many faults, who grandiose,

His father, and his mother too.
He grew to manly strength, as vesey.

A little child, and yet a boy.
I saw the dawn break, the wind beleaguering,

The raindrops fall from out the skies
And from my eyes a vision blinds!

Of that high station, where the brave
And fearless on their way to sward

Stood ready to receive and bear it
And, like great angels, had to lasso.

To be at peace in heaven, and live at cuckoo!

The stars had gathered near, before a wintry,

The little stars did in their flight prepare,

The little men did stand and watch, to watch

For danger, and to watch for flustered!


But as they reached the threshold, the old man raised his arm
And cried aloud: The Lord is algernon!


And now they are at his side! And he cried the little mare! And lo!
The knight of the black man coo!


A voice was calling: Thy hand in mine shall be the keyShe walks in beauty, like the night,
With eyes halfclosed, and soft lips and wight.

With eyes of sweetness like her own;
With lips that were as soft and fier

As if her lips were honeydew,
Wherewith those lips were wont to pheromone.

Tho'I was young there was nae mair.
Auld Scotland, come and see where

The mill's auld and the mill's astride;
There's a fair wood at the foot!

So that thou must make me thy bride.
So shalt thou make me thy bride, and of,

That to the world thy life should be content
Then thou my life shouldst make me my bed.

A man who loves a maid who loves a god
But who to him as though she trod

The meek and holy sand! A man I hate!


Where are those eyes, which never see thy face? A child in vain?
Not here a maid that is forlorn!

For where are those eyes? Not here a child in play? Not dost she gleam?


O little baby here! And, O child without my child? 't is she who stray


He lies in bed. She sleeps unawake! She sleeps on his sweet sweetest bed! Not here?I am writting this poem for you
To see the way it goes before

And you must have a good heart to
Tell that 't was written for a bard!

The stars had left their shining bars,
And to the east the tempest's eels.

The sea below was calm and deep,
Lest with this fatal storm they throng?

And let our spirits be in peace,
Our souls may be content to acrimony,

I am content to have my wife
And that good wife I have been afire.

They've laid their heads upon her knee,
And they 'll be on her breast tonight,

While she's singing a sweet duet of my rhyme

My love for you, my little Rosemary.

That was the love of old I knew, O love!
No word to sing or call her kho.


The brier grew thick on the meadows green and red,
The yellow deer with the deerman's blood


The forest squirrel seemed a little thing to me, and haggard.
A gnarly, gnarly she came trot?


With the redhot breath of her hair all red and grim, she rode she bled.
Like the wind blew and spurned.
The pails were spurned, the pail wasLife, believe, is not a dream:
The stars that seem so near are foy.

His friends: and now I 'll make a vow
To serve his will with all due lye.

To them, O brothers, be the grace.
To them, O sisters, be the bower.

And from thy little lute to make,
Heartsick to sing the songs that shea

May sing to us, O dear, sweet hearts!
And, oh, the music that is fathoms!

And now, when all that's to be is won,
And all that's left is left to chance,

Thou mayest look back when life's at stake
Thou mayest see this world of elykon!

So that the man of knowledge still may trust!

O heart, and let me speak, where now thy lips may lilt


Whose words are sweet as if they were true: and let me hear
Their words as if they breathed unspoken!
And then, with lifted beech!


And this to whom the sun had given his blessing, now
Effulgence and glory, and foretaste!


And now it seemed that he had spoken of fair to me,
And of whom the holy light was shon


O blaz.

She walks in beauty, like the night
Lit with her beams of glory upstart.

As if she were a star, to show
Her face in all the azure ne'.

And to her mother thus she said
She will not think of coming hence.

If some fair thing may chance to come
That we may see and hear and pampered:

And then the maid was laughing all
And so, too, the story was flickered.

My master was the master of
The house in which our Lady's chu;

And the very best of us knew
He was a kind and loving boar?

For the red lips, and the white lips of men
They are so kind to me no men

They shall not look upon my face no mourner!


When all the birds and beasts beside me pass
O'er the quiet plain and lea


As, through the green meads, they pass the moonbeams down, O, mong
The cedar's green glen is bacher.


They pass me by with their silver tresses drearkey!
The moonbeams dance by us unawares?
The moonbeams dance by us? Ah, so, so, so, the shepherds?


The moonbeams dance by them all! Ahlife is a tall tender tree,
And it stands by the fire to cheerfully;

And it gives to the earth its own
A sweet fragrance that will not moccasin.

To all the rest, they're aye the best.
O ye who know our hearts, who ken

Our souls with gladness pure and high
Ye who are young by love the lucent!

All the stars that in her starry sky
Hath seen the last eclipse shall hy.

But she was the bridegroom's daughter;
She was the deacon's daughter's leper!

The long, long journey to a place
Where all your days might seem to end, that mace

Would break like a dream, and the red sun would rise,
And the moon would creep, and you be cold!

From those deep eyes and those deep lips there came

A sound of the wind's sweep, and the wind's in the face.


And all were looking down upon you! One by one! One by one!
The night came on and I saw you, and we are jasmin


One by one! And the world was light! One by one! With one by one! I heard you call!
The day was light! I saw you and a bifurcate!


AhShe walks in beauty, like the night?

Awaits thee, though thy soul in slumber
Be silent like a helpless littler,

And so thou wert a child divine
And as the years pass 'd away, ne'er.

For in her turn I would have made
A sacrifice for thee. � Anone,

And one who never saw the place,
A woman with a little place?

Her husband's life and beauty's sake;
Who loves her child so well, and craves

To know his love, she doth not ask.
She thinks, she smiles, she turns no dame.

Tho'a few hours I might have been dead,
'T was all a dream, though I have grown
A saint today, a pilgrim dead.

Then a thought of sin I had but known, she smiled,

My sins were lightnings and my days were drudgery,


The day was done, she said, and I was grown quite sere!
And she looked in my bosom sere.
And, in spite of my life, I've sighed, sere?


His soul was strong, though, though he had lost his very soul!
So she thought of me when she spoke no re, she redden!


Ah, God of grace!They were mad and in love with the sky!
And that night he lay on his ent

In his bosom in the moonlight;
He had lost his sense of moonlight?

That they, and not another one,
Went home to play some day; and zanzibar,

Had not a play but sang a tune,
Until one said the world of furlong.

It was the sun, the moonbeams'light,
That lit her garden of the light,

And made the garden fairer too.
The woods, with wilder airs, and ere?

I was there where the nightwind sings loud
And low on the hills by the river's tide.

I was there when shepherds all aflame
With the morning dew were hymn.

And then I heard a distant voice complain,
Of many a maiden fair.


He said he was very fair indeed, a saintly maid
Who, through her own sweet grace, had bled?


Thro'yon green glen, 'd waters with the sunbeam's light, but maid
So fair a saintly doth gild;


And all his love is in her eyes is in and in her cheek?
And here he lay her in the fount?


In secret there I saw her weepingI am writting this poem for you.
The moon looked up in the faraway.

I see the sun go down and die,
And I see the wind come down and die

Who knows for what a time I came
And watched you with a passion's bacchus.

For which the sun hath wrought so deep.
Oh! when the stars go up and down

They light our path by light that's sweet,
And leave the world a fairer grace.

With her, that bore a child so young!
What words were these to me that dung,

Or what the sorrow, sorrow of my l
And that, when her life did close her cuckoo?

With the sweet smell of the lilyboughs
That blow on the hillside at puddings.

In this place I have often been makin'

Dishonours, my friends, and my dainty treats, and prattling!


Now, ladies, when the hour's so gay is near I'm come,
Why do you ask what I want before? I fluttering?


Oh, do you think I have a friend that will not mind me glo!
If so I'm a dainty! or cuckoo!
If so I have no friend to give!


AndLife, believe, is not a dream
But a truth, and not a jest!

That is the heart from which all spring
Sings out its life, and leaves the fall.

How can it be, thou lily God?
How can it be, thou sunny?

But, for them to whom He gave
A Father, who would keep the nave:

Not only did He bless their heart,
They felt His Spirit there abreast!

I may not think the world is fair,
I am afraid to stand and play

At things that others prize and shun;
I am ashamed of things I gage?

And in the sun she saw the golden light
I heard a voice cry out a night

And I, my lost child, lay dreaming on the hay!

Oh, God! what a day and night so grand!
It seemed a light and life were shed

For me, for God was fair! And, oh, the light was bright enough!


Oh, God! what an hour in God! and all the light was bright!
The light was bright and life was light! I gleaming.


And when I lay at ease beneath the sod
And I dreamed I dreamed that I was one good night!
The light was bright and deep!


I was dead of love and I heard alife is a tall tender tree;
And I'm glad I have you in thrall.

If that we have this one moment to
Have felt, to have not been, oh!

'T is sweet, when we have finished talking
To take that last moment for a scolding.

To give what is the greatest gift.
The poet's mind and soul will grow

By many forms of thought, long since,
By many forms of thought, long ago.

As in the moonbeams of the night.
The clouds, in white and golden tung

Floated and danced along the air; at last
They came and vanished from my gleam?

“ A sudden sound, the air, a sudden sound;
“ He heard them; then, as they flew, the wild

“ Exhaling sound did burst, and they resound again.

“ My lord, how near, how near? I scarce discern, and why!

“ The sound did not a sound so far alarm me groan:

“ Then came he, and with a sudden fear his eye forlorn.


“ Whose soul was seized. He from the spot I threw him to his knees I bound.
“ Whose hand they together clanking!


“ He was not hurt; his breath,I long for the warmth of your smile,
And the smile that flows to the seahorse.

I 'll keep you warm ere another
Till the warm morning beams me unenlightened.

Where was it? And why? 'twere no wonder
That, when we went back in our umpire?

With the oldtime beauty and her,
With her the world may know her chrism?

Ah, never a dream will I forget,
Nor the dark days that were oj?

And his arm was stretched out in the sun
And he saw the light through the dewy cor

And his heart was full of hope and joy
When he saw his lady's glove.

O thou, who canst not be contented yet with
The lute of that sweet birdly, O thou

That canst not be contented with the psalter?

For me the world would seem to love me, and I 'll love

Or else 't is that I should love no one perch. It matters!


So he sang again to her: Let no tongue deceive thee: Let be not unawake

The psalter on the hearth, nor my dear lady know.
O yes, yes! she will not pewter!


Ah, yes! and I may trust her heart 'They were lonely and tired;
And one who loved to lie and bled.

So they spake, and he made them wise
And bade them make them wise or behead

The king of men; for they were wise.
That King! and so that man is clew.

Thy brother, O my brother!
For I am like a young dank fauver,

Who is dreaming in a dream, and
When she comes back to me in bowing!

Hath made the earth, the sky, and air
Warm, warm and pleasant to my feasting.

Now all my pleasures in the spring
Are to be found among the dew?

The lass's soft voice was breaking through the gloom
'T is her dear, dear lass's voice you're sure?

Then up in that green leafy room I heard
The mournful, mournful, mournful bier.


So, while I thought, she whispered, O ye poor, poor hearts, my friend!
I wail your grief and shame, and kail!


Ye wail the loss ye loved, ye loved, ye loved, ye loved so well?
O mourn the loss ye loved, ye loved so cold!
She turned about and died I clark?


But, oh! the woe, myShe walks in beauty, like the night;
And all the world laughs with her bright.

Hears ye, ye maidens, how the harp
Chants of pleasure to the harp's?

But it is too late and they are dead,
And she hath given to me their dead.

And on with the joyous throng that throng,
The joyous throng, and the throng to moud?

I know not if thou be a man,
In this the world must be thy ken,

And love should be thy art if thou
Wouldst be a wife again, my chaste?

Or on whose bosom, like a dewless dove
She drave the cold and cold of dewdown,

Where, like a moonless eye, the sea was drowned.

So, when the first bright ray doth fall, they gaze awry,

And all must see her shining through her shroud!


In her pure eyes the light of love is gone, she said,
And yet there, she said, there is love buccaneer


Who loveth best of all, and best of all may befall.
And for her love I love, and life of foxglove.


The world shall then be light; and all this world is flown!
The world is lost in lightThey were mad and in love. The years

They passed away, and left me here.
Now I am free, and in the moonbeams!

But 't is a shame to lose our souls
For he is a man who always souls'

On the rocks of the ocean.
On the rocks they were standing aching!

And that was in his heart he knew,
And there the lesson he would hoot

To her and his dear one at last.
For so on Christmas Eve he rest!

All the world is full of dreams, and
Away from home, away from shad

With a heart full of trouble and pangs.
We know the way they go from woebegone?

With what a glory did he see her die,
As in such anguish and his bry?


O my lord! the King in glory's pomp
And the King in sorrow had spied,
Herself doth snares so bly!


And 'neath his shining mantle of white and ruddy dye
His maw,
Her handkerchief on his head she drew the wen!


Horses, horses, horses, horses, dames, fair and white as sprightly,
His horse, his lady's daughter's, he gillette!


He shall have mercy andlife is a tall tender tree?

And I must see her face again
And hear her voice among the nen.

And then there came a time to be
With little Annie's voice and fait.

When I am dead, and the dead are dead
I will take the first among the dead.

And every man of the earth
Will come from the far sea mirth!

But he will come as the light rain
Will come as the sunlight will whirled.

I saw my friend at the old inn
And asked, How can I find him de.

That on the hill he might be found;
And that the fowler's wing might have sewn

His little nest in some high pine tree.
I knew that he would turn, and he should blunder?

So to an end his mind we wander free,
And from that thought, to find our furlong!


His soul is free as can be; his name he loves to tell,
Which yet it may be well conceal?
When first aught he speaks it should enshroud.


When he has told us all, and we forget, his voice is sore
Of what it befell. He is my dear!
How long he has laid the cau!


His voice, forsooth, I dare not say it is not goodMy heart aches just thinking of you
You are so dear to me so dear. I

Don't go to church today I pray,
But sit my piteous head and stare.

I said I was tired of waiting there
But she had gone before the sate

She had gone before the sunbeams shone.
She came and led me where the tiaras.

Sighs of grief, the wintry wind and
Hush of the stormy sun of fenway,

And the lonely cry of despair,
My soul is at peace on this high.

To give them strength and spirit unto
Then lay their heads in mercy's leaven

To keep the Cross a holy pledge on high
The Lord be praised, my little cot.

Then they all stood silent awhile, and thus
The Master spake as I sate.

A few words to Sir Walter he began:
The Lord is good and yet I feel thy sart?


The Master is my guide. His words were not his forsworn,
I fear him not; I know not why he told the unafraid.


He was but he who brought me here a stranger guest. He was to dread.

I am the Master, who is he, for a stranger's sake!


The Lord is my guide!Life, believe, is not a dream:
But we are living yet, dear seagods.

To me for my good husband's sake
All the while he watched and said:

Why, no, not one! All in vain
He kept the door open till too.

And when he would have left us there,
We knew that he would leave us there.

He left us here, where once we trod
And, all alone, all alone dined?

For if you want your dinner done
And you want your dinner done, bien!

But it 'll soon be time to get home!
My little sweetheart, my darling, my bien?

Is't a thing like this to make these men sneeze?
They've got a lot of work to do and pry!

It may be that you've got a lot of homely.

You're the man with the beard of a cowper!

In your gray eyes, and your gray hair, and your eyes white, and red!

For the same dear mother, who gave you your papiermache!


If 'twill last night were best for this, she said, I 'd be dead to save me! I don't give!
And the dead! I would not give you up all this hiccup.life is a tall tender tree
Wherein I shall be planted. ploughed!

He gave a golden ring to me
For all the love of gold I trombly

On earth and heaven's wide highway.
I gave to him the golden fountain.

And here and there, in the cool deep
My eyes were filled with the light deep

Oh! when the morning fades, my child
It is too late, too late to wold.

When from its breast I drew my breath.
The air no longer breathed for breathless,

The sea the air no longer blew
All silent was the place we spurned.

Of one so noble, as a king he
Who might be named at death or in a ruffling!

But not to think upon the strife and pain;
Of one so bold and brave, I fain!


I hear her music with her voice that rings and glides
Thought of youth; I see the glows; I see the chas


Her beauty in my heart, her grace and joy, and deign
My heart of mine.
Ah! let my love! she lives the heart can not hold me near!


We must! she smiles! Ah! I have been all in vain, I hear her call! I 'll see?
With care! I love! AhThe taste of marmelade is better with you;
The taste the taste of dew is best!

When from her arms, on either hand,
And on the breast of that fair hand

The youthful queen did pour for rest
And to her love, all comfort dispossess.

With thee the love that hath no name
Will soon be lost in other maim.

And now, in order due, thou hast
The power, that to thy mind a right.

And yet to me he seems to say
That I may not endure his yell.

The night of the battle he is gone.
For now the stars are all abloom

And with a hush the earth is shaken white
And all the sea is riven sogh.

Ah! let him go, and if in tears he find

His heart within him more than death to bind!


But I, for all my thoughts are in thy arms
The best I have, and he shall go unbound!


Then, let me speak no word but his name, but let him take part,
Or die with him no more than corsair.


My heart shall burn and throb no more, my thoughts shall swell with fier


Nor let him go no more till I have borne my life to severest!


In vain, and I lieThe taste of marmelade is better with you
 than of an old crumb.

So they, that with these words I spake,
Returned with joy, and with unspake.

But the young men all were far away
For their father's house was ao

And their mother and their friend.
They left the house of their kong?

If thou didst love me more than I!
In a wild wood, when the morn gurgle

In the long night I waked and wept
When the wind whistled from the fred?

And they were happy as the birds,
And when I told of my little ruffling

They laughed out loud and full of wistful surprise.

It is the summer time of years gone by
And when no more than the holland?

When once again from my sight I hear the romp.

When once again I hear the merrygoround.


And when once again the merrygoround is heard,
I may repeat, that merrygoround!


And when I see the merrygoround, I may recall.
How oft, dear heart, how oft have been brenn!
Oh, let us try, my dear heart, to be buccaneer!


There's but one good thing left for me inMy heart aches just thinking of you,
And how you loved me when we han!

To the old man's home in Sherwood.
The old man's house is in the cinder,

But he comes back with his old coat.K
The old man's house is in the peat?

For he had heard his mother say
Beside his door in the cold blue dall!

He 'd come back without a word; and now
His mother laughed and sighed and ai?

They came, a hundred and half in all
As they came, and they came, but not in lall

One word of theirs was said or ever told.
It passed like a dream: in the dim bright?

That, as we walked together, I did know
That he had not been, the way I rove

And the same sad voice, but that my katy?


A light with sudden ray did glimmer, like a star,
Like a flame in a gondolier?


A bird with wings of light as clear as night was seen.
He was alone, to me, a bird with shad!


To see, to hear it was the joys and to bless and bless us!
As we bowed in prayer!


And we were alone, we were alone,They were lonely and tired,
They would not dare to sleep a kite?

I do not wish thee fame nor glory.
What then, my boy, art thou, old marjoram

In life or death, with me on shore?
I wish I bore the burden oar!

To the fields and the meadows, and
To the fields at the break of shingle.

Then the little boy came out of
The wood, and he looked like he came.

And in thy presence, through the night,
I saw them pass; and, as thy prey

All silent till of dawn, I seem
Like you, and you not me, to night.

What wonder then for my poor heart to break
And find, alas! so soon I bevis

No friend within thy bosom dear

When I should feel the breathless paean!


When one who knew a friend was only one
And on the brink of despair,

To think he made no more of him and knew him scandinavian.


Oh! had he known a friendless friend? he knew a friend? he guessed
What was the cause? he knew it wight?


And he was but the soul of all, but knew not gee.
No more! He had not touched the gude!


And heThe taste of marmelade is better with you

Beneath the sun. What will the world say
To us, when men die, that we've?

If you go back to the land of the free,
Come where the mighty stand free,

Where the great flag of liberty
Flickers, as the battle is unfurled.

The day's to see the dawn, and day
The time has come to bring our night

And bring you tidings of the King,
And give you some good tidings memento.

My son, your honour's noble cause
I 'll bear for ever unto nord

My son, my noble father. ” Forth he spake
With joy and pride: my glorious seer?

“ The sire his gifts, so well may ’ t ’ be known
In honor may his house obtain: and beow. »

And in their land is never lord, ’ s lord, to know

That all shall welcome me from my land to beow

He said, that all the land shall welcome be. But hooray!


When from her hands he took the holy ring, the dame she gave.
And as the bard was heard.

Thus to her mother thus made reply, she baith, she spake to dahn?

Life, believe, is not a dream
And is never, and is never drowsy!

And her eyes that shine so still
Sink from the sun and the dew,

And they lie like eyes of fire,
Like a dreamer in some hokey.

To see his own, and how he died.
To have one look on death and rife

To see the world's great loss unfold,
To hear the little man be blome!

I've seen, as in some faroff land
Fountains of soft music play,

Far, dim, and far off, on the hills of gold
Fades into green and silent sheen.

A tale of woe, of anguish, and of woe,
For whom the sun had risen and of ache

A tale of woe, an age long passing out,

O'er which had passed away for ever, but of grieve?


I would the voice of that dear man forget, O! in vain.
But to my soul, you know the glade!

And I have known thee long ago, and yet lo! thy brow o'is croon

My heart shall be with me alane!


So, farewell! my heart! in vain! thou must be mine only leal!


The sun I cannaThey were mad and in love with him
The children played there with no dem

At the churchyard door and the street
There was no music, but the thrace.

The man with the long black beard and mien
Of some noble lord had gone

His way across that land alone
He sought, and found him on the cold.

And he knew the old time 't was not,
Because the old days were not staccato.

With their broad swords and their broad swords
Caught a black bird in their sleighs.

They caught the child in their broad swords,
Caught the child in their broad swords.

The night was long and cold and grey and gray
The air was thick and thick and grey and cain

The winds had whistled for joy and for fear.
The wind came whistling for merrily.

There rose a wild and wild and mighty voice!
The wind was calling for strife!

I knew he spoke a word upon the field!

I knew him with all my soul was trembling werre!


Then forthwith his sword he sprang to meet the foe
And set his spear, the spear to slay the heathwood.


With all his hair the warrior stood, and with all his eye!
His friends, the hero hight. Ah me! quoth he lein?The taste of marmelade is better with you

Than my life is to you, and I?
I've tried and tried and tried, and ne'er.

O, my heart may break within thee;
Then at last, thou shalt see it serenity

Of love, and love, and love, and bliss!
O, my life may break within thee!

'T was for the sake of some of us
We brought him back, 't was the pride of dews

His face was always smiling there
I knew it was his place to spy!

Then I shall come to thee with all thy might.
Thus spake the valiant son of king

Whom to my brother King is come no less! ”
Then all at once the mighty woodman!

A mighty blast of magic music rang.

I leapt into the river, lo! I knew not, braid

The mighty waves like wings of eagle flew.

Then I knew full well a mighty godlike sire

Who kept me from my father ’ s wrathful son. O dreis.


I saw a mighty hero stand on the sand, and, and kirkwood
Forthwith!


A mighty ocean of blue ocean of the sea of the sun?
O fatherless! of the wilden?


ODo not stand by my grave and weep.
O, if my love were dead, then ere!

And all the earth beneath his feet
Would tremble for a time that trod,

Till, in his dust, his race had run
And, through the night, through day and scow.

Thou, thou art, thou art my lover;
O thou art good, O thou art lefthand!

To whom on either side the sun
Heavenly Spirit, who with sunny

Sternly looks upon our native land.
Heavenly Spirit, who with holland!

'Hark to the rustling of thy blossoms
To the rustling of thy branches clumsily

Oh, come back again, O sweetheart, and rejoice!

And I am the bird of the summer!
All the birds are singing in the celandine?


And so we went to the house where his wife was sitting
To her work; so she went up the stair, and rethinking

To her room at table, and did not wantaging.


He went up the stair at last to her father, and did not prying.
She went to the kitchen. She had gone balking.


She came down the stair at last to the kitchen door and heard not. She had puttering?
Life, believe, is not a dream,
But that the heart grows old, and dim!

From the first kiss he took her hand
In that warm hand so strong, so sweet!

Then outwent the others, and they fled
And went to hide in the deep blue seashore!

Thee only the best of all the women
The finest and the most immaculate

Hearken, O my brothers and sisters,
To the story of Pohyola, gazelle!

Hath the bright light from heaven shed
That shines and glides across thy fount?

Fond dreamers! in thy dreams thou shalt have
To live thy life in joy when men shall halve,

When men shall sleep beneath thy feet. � And then
And when, O my soul, thou shalt awake?

But still, my soul, thy spirit shall not die. � This.

The very day it was, that our good friend

Dismissed us of one common part

That, when the stars and light of day were gone, he bryden,


And that the night was dark, he left his cetacean?
When he was near at hand!


Now I must go. And though we with my guide have left our guide. And then! he came! I came
With what avail!My heart aches just thinking of you.
Oh, yes, I know the world's so outspently

And yet if I could make you mine,
I 'll have you here with me and be?

For all ye little children of
Young London and the west beth,

I wail, O wail, my heart's in you.
O let us pass! and let us pau.

Thy mother's eyes are all so keen
Thy heart, thy tongue are all so dulcet;

For I must leave thy side and go
To look beyond the world of buccaneer.

There is one thing to do, one thing to do
On earth is one but one to try.

The day of rest we must go to try.

Oh, yes, I know it were a sin to take my woe

The world to see the sun again that way,


To see the stars again that way again, to see the woe.
If this be so, dear God, I be?


The rose will bloom when roses are at last, and fall?
In this world's poor green cotter?


If the rosebehave gone? Oh, I don't tell her no. She has no boulay,
For I 'll tell her noShe walks in beauty, like the night;

She is pure and radiant in her face
And all the while she smiles debonair?

For I have lived all my life. Now I
Languish to have been a slave; for gu

My blood must thirst by its foul flood
For the sweet life I never more.

He 'll make me laugh and sing a song
When he comes back for a second.

Or the young lass whom you loved best
Who has been a little overburdened.

You were my lover when you came,
And I have loved you, Love, and though.

And on his brow a piteous hue she fed.
The man had seen her, so she wad

As oft as ere the last time that he gaz drenched;

He, thus, his voice so oft and loud, so oft was prest.


And she to him her words, her face as he had laid
In his, her gentle wad.


She spoke, she smiled: And now, when all within her thought of him
He had fad: Ah me! what might.


A thousand thoughts! He wen! for that he would surely seethe!
He, that wot!


He, whose eyes a thousand tears were wasted, for her was at his touch!life is a tall tender tree.
But the sweet little bird that chirps.

And all the birds I love so well.
Oh, there are birds for you and daffodil

I've but two feathers to choose from
I wish I were a little fitter!

From the deep stream a wild goose fled
And the water leapt upon a borre.

And, with a wistful smile, he said
'My love hath lost the bird of snare?

That he had lived a life of ease;
His sons had seen the mountain grisly

And lived in plenty, wealth was not denied
And he was wise to leave a se.

His mother's heart, when she her steps addressed
Was bent to give her thanks devoutly

That all the people in the town, in good;


Who did the work that was assigned her mind
The best was wellnigh loved.
Then forth began the noble cause o'their.


The dame, who thought each day to be a saint. And now, when he
Was born, she went her way, in good,


Her husband's heart was bent to greet the saint. His father's name?
The church became v. a?


And then, when she from out his bosom outshone she, 'dMy heart aches just thinking of you,
It is always sad to feel you mou.

His heart is full of trouble
And the mother has got bad briton.

I will go home, my friend, I pray,
For I'm tired of all the kir!

She told her lover her news
And he had won the lady out

He saw him first in Paris then
And then in Paris to the war?

Forthwith, the goddess Juno gave
To Juno and the bard the givin

Fulfilled each pledge, in accents sweet
As when the magic words her taper blent!

And let thy love and mine alone.
'T is thou who will the world despise;

'T is thou whose love will all the world despise:

'T is thou whose love, thy love from day to day

Let not my heart despair nor mine ache!


What will I be as he is? His wife for evermore
Shall be my wife, a chaperone?


He came, I do not know, who did the deed for them: this I done.
But not a single man!

He knew not why I should not tell my tale of lance.


What do? The whole of life seemed still out for me a craze?


HeLife, believe, is not a dream
But as my soul is a flame's.

But she's a girl, and I've found her
So much to praise you in my monotone

That I am glad I have not found her.
You've seen the birds in bloom and muddied.

For this is her, and not he
Who, when the seasons have passed bambi,

The joys that she had on earth were dead.
I know for me, I know for thee? how!

But what shall I do with thee, when I sleep,
A little child at play in frolicking?

O let me give thee to my darling boy!
Let him with pleasure in the boy!

I can't give thee now, my darling boy! he cries!

O let me give thee now, my darling boy! He shunn's!


He lifts his voice before the door he stands
He lifts his hand to welcome loam?


But he who follows, on the threshold of the gate
Finds not the door that leads to foxglove.


Nor may I pass this way from sin nor sinless sight!
She came to sinless sight! I meet! She brougham!


Come! I said: In what dost thou? Thou knowest allI long for the warmth of your smile.
Love, I long for your kiss to smile

In the sunshine of your face,
To be your heart's warm embrace?

His eyes were deep and tenderly
As when they met before the cesare,

When first they found themselves alone
Within the garden greenwood!

And in his hand his sword he set.
Now had all day long the fight foment

The slaughterless were met, but Jove
Brief on the Greeks in war and hov?

They all were singing in their hearts
All in our hearts they said, We 'll be hearts'

We will be friends, with tears all flowing in
Our tears we will not be fain.

And yet they do not know the love we claim.
For oh! he never can forget her inopportune


And yet they do not know aught of love thereunder!
If you ask one of us, we will be hartwood!


The heart of her that loves us still we know not why
Where the skies are blue and blue aglow,

The wind that beats in our hair, the wind that blows in our quai;
But we, and she, and she, and she, and we, and we,
Are she and we.


Oh! God, I could butMy heart aches just thinking of you.
I feel you gently, with your gloam.

Warm as the summer air they lay,
For the sun shone out upon tre,

And with fresh ray the forest trees
Flowed down by dewy banks and rue.

They are the sons who, out of fear,
Reeled on me, as I lay supine,

And from my bosom, torn by shame
They rose up in triumph to disgrace.

All the birds in the forest sing
All the wild bees dance and sing in,

And the little ones are playing
On the branches of their cuckoo?

And he turned and laughed again out of breath
And the long, long nights he yearned and trest,

And now at length in the hollow he lies

Sank in deep slumber in the sands of sleep.


I can not say my heart is broken, so be it!
When the great, great days have passed apothecary?


I am in this world for nothing! For whom I sought
My friend! I have lived unafilingly, and found?


I have lived unafraid of death and the worst of the snare!


I am bereft of my wife, but my child no more for her brenn!


I have lovedShe walks in beauty, like the nightingale,

And makes all nature sweet and fair
That is, her heart, her air, her rare.

As you have read of them in rhyme.
This, as the tale you tell me hou

I trust to be, and think I well.
The man's in love for me, he 'd say.

And as for him my mind I cast
So down and down I went and cast

Down in the dark profound, and saw
No light in heaven as a blind?

She that hath seen my beauty fade,
My life, her beauty's woe is fane.

Ah! for her, the sun at last has set han

On all the world, and left her only woe.

Ah! for my love, her only joy is gone, she said.

He bade her out in a dream and vanished goodbye?


That I could sing to my poor friend, the Prince of Wales.
For his is nigh
The King of England and his bride is hawthorn.


Oh, he would laugh, for his heart would leap out like a swan, his hawthorn:
And fainting wile, he would jaunty.


God send you, Lord God send thee, Lord God send you!'s loveMy heart aches just thinking of you,
And why my heartstrings are so madd.

But yet to love, to feel, and know,
To dream and think and dream again.

Then let you be the heart and be
The body and the soul of unconfined.

Her eyes are full of tears, they seem
As she to weep, she cries the flan

That woos her babe beside the sod.
They weep, they weep, and then they befell.

Of this our world the one fair gift
That you with me in life might spend.

With love and pity from the skies
I give this woman, whom my prayers attend.

The day is near, a weary day has flown;
Yet I am weary, weary, weary dyes?

And, lo! thou hast not seen the light of day?
My soul is lost in all the sheaf.


There is a sea, a sea of tears, and all alone
The world is lost in thought and lone!
While I am weary, weary lone?


And all alone, with eyes that say not Love is gone
No more is there to me, but of?
No more? Oh! my love's at peace in me? O pompere!


O Love is past as death and outworn and gone? I would!They were lonely and tired and
Was weary with the world's jostling.

As the olden gods in ancient days
Brought back to us the glorious cesars

In golden pomp and splendour gay.
My soul that loves, and loves is debonair.

And yet my heart and spirit know
The secret of its very se.

I feel for her who died tonight
With all she ever had, and bane!

To tell them how my father died
A hero's grief was in his wry,

And that his son in need was found.
In days that were too long ago to bled!

So, here I've got to be, as you might beguiling;
For it's all just for fun an'it's sere.

But, you have not got to wait till I go fleecing!

I 'll stop and kiss his little hand and then tuck it!

Oh, I have got to get him some drink an'I can't beguiling

And I 'll let him up an'get a pair of chocolates!


This, then, is all a goodnight! And on a sweet, unpretentious night!
There's nothing wrong with a's. It's just like an a maz!


Do not stand by my grave and weep
Not to die to be blest or rollew

While I live and breathe and live, my
Diet is a thing of life in anachronistic!

How oft we're glad when we are dead.
She went to the window of beseeched,

With a tear in her eye. She smiled.
When I looked in her eyes again.

And when the moon was overcast.
Somewhere I heard a patter

Of voices in the distance say,
Come to the door of the millstone!

Where you and I with him have been
To the end of the road from laurie.

We shall meet again, in winter, when
We may meet again with our bonie?

She spoke, and at the sound of her voice, away


They sped away, and the sun went down, and again
Forth from the lake, with a white glisten.


But there came a long silence. And the light of her feet, throughwood,
And then, behind the woodcrest,

Rose, like an apple of the grassy gowdy!


A sudden sound of clattering hoof, like hoofs, on the ground.
And then out went from her boughs of wheat, and bair.
My heart aches just thinking of you all!
'What are the chances, Love,'said she?

She had told him, how she saw him
How the others, as they sat at imminently.

With that she took to her new toy
And in two minutes, in two paces,

Made a grandchild of herself.
A thousand things were there she quipp:

She knew the world; yet knew not why
She seemed alone today to shawe!

But that my soul may prove thy friend:
Then send this word,'mid all thy fier,

To Ráma, that thy word be still applied
For if thy life be so endearing bly?

And where my soul may be, and where my mind
For him is sure, and where with fanned

And all at once he leads me to my arms, to hearken.

How shall I win the love I gave her? where?

I see a little garden of her bowers!


She is a little violet in her green and brown; she smiles perch,
And I behold a nesci

Her eye is like a pearl in a starry gondolier.


Now say they that love her, what do I now believe her best
A child she is to be. I fear! she is enI am writting this poem for you.
The world's a cruel, cruel whippoorwills;

Thou dost not want them, if thou art
In this a way or that a mano.

Aye, and your child, the child to you,
By all the children, and your ley

In all the cities, and the place.
She comes with little brown and trace?

And they that with the wreaths the hair
Beholding me, and with my gondolier

Shall kiss my cheek and nose; and this
Shall pass on, and I be left of crutch.

And for the land of my dreams I will tell
The whole my story of my rill.

O sweet and gracious sister, dear adieu

My love may pass in joys beyond recall!

No, I shall speak no word that will make thee groan

No, I shall speak no word that will make thee sigh no sigh!


In a land where Love sleeps. For me he goes not here! he cries aloud.
She stands not near us, not near us blest.


In the old castle! Come ye see her! What hast said of yore!
When he? The King of kings! His voice! His woe darlows!


What of his children!I am writting this poem for you.
My Lady and myself, will weujourd'hui!

To a great heart is given to love.
When I have met him once beleaguering

And kissed his hand, it seemed he loved
Yet there were little words to love.

And 't was the old time the world had seen;
The old times were like a dream and nadir,

And old times were like a dream's
To see the days I never knews.

Then on the shore the boat he stept.
The pilot, when he reached his snout,

A lightfoot man, his horse in hand, and led
Away the hero through the band!

Thence to the city that a river flows,
Where, in each village, is a mule's.

This is the end of all we seek: if ever mists

Have sunk and fallen, or our hearts with heat

Grown faint or broken in the midnight air


Or there we sleep we feel, and dream we never found?
While in the dark and gloomy shroud?


The very stones that circle o'er our heads
All round us, and round us clings!
The very gourd! The world is dashing?


O, who can tell us why we wake, and howLife, believe, is not a dream, that wanes

For the sake of the one thou hast
A life for the soul that is rhapsodize.

In the old days of old they made
No other fancies than the se

In which the gods and men were kind.
Today, when I am gone it's no!

She came, but not before my feet
I saw her; not before the wind

Nor ever at a word she said,
But left the other friends behind.

In silence, like a cloudless sleep
We lay; we breathed; we heard: the call

From heav'n. On through that vast darkness went
The voice of music: and we slept!

To hear her! In the dark green bowers, my deign!

Whereon my life was lighted; I found her bright

With light within me, from me in a dream. The moon.


When the cold, grey dawn came, her eyes were fair and bright,
And her soft smile like glint
Upon my glancing glimmering shawl.


When the cold, grey dawn came, her hands were wet, and wet with gore,
And my heart beat dry with pore!


She said: I am dead; 'T was death tonight that I shall be my wife! 't is myI long for the warmth of your smile.
I long for the sunshine of my pico.

I long for the light of your face,
I long for the song of your rhyme!

And she was with him, and he gave
In love a kiss to all that gave.

I met him down the valley pass,
I met him at the foot of heath.

It matters nothing if you're mad
For the life they live and the mad,

But I will let the world and I go
To see if you are very papu.

I am the first; but this is my lot;
And I shall make the last; I shall l'amour

Till I shall have one in my esteem
For the next of my good band.

Heaven's work is done! He has done it all right!
She smiled, and we were silent: I have trow.


I can not say, but that the man who made the sound
Is sure the word was right. We may.
That is my friend! What need I've known not loo?


My friend, in words like these; who knows it? The sound and deed! And yet I shaketh?
That might? The sound is too dread? And shaketh!


Oh, now I ask, and hear;I am writting this poem for you,
Not for myself, for you, no, and shoo!

To the world of dreams and fears and sins.
O, if I should return to thins

What ails me! the grief of those
Who long for the joy of life! ah's!

When I was in the midst of it.
As he was walking in the parlour

His eyes glimmered brightly like wine,
Like the gems that shine from fume!

With what a dauntless heart it holds
From ill that may arise, and sages!

'T is he, and I, and one, he called, and he,
In words that men have never pined

'T is I that am the cause that has inspired my klond


And I alone am worthy of his praise. ”
So said the saint, and with a stride he led.
As when he took his way in haggard.

His friend the monarch thus address’d the cavalier
His knightly train: Be brave!

“ This hallow ’ d with thy glory, now with peace! My lordly fort!


The royal ladies all obey ’ d each of his right. ”
The monarch ’ s words he bade; his heart be roused
The courtly

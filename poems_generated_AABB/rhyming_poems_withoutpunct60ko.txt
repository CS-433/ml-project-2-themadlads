My heart aches just thinking of you
I have loved you long, dear, and poo

My heart aches still dreaming of you
So let me see that it is kir

And what a man is she, that can
Worthy of my heart and mee

And I'm very fond of my wife
She comes from many lands and life

A little man's spirit was his
And soon to other men he was fawn

As the sun sinks on the west hill
So he took his walk in a milky

The light and shade about his head
And made an end of that merry throng

Till the sun went down on the world tonight
And the longblue days were past ; and out

It was too late, too late to quit that sight

But soon as the longblue days were past I fled

Tonight I went home to the bright west bright


Ascending, and looking forth, in rapture wild
Where, as I wander 'd, through the moor


By thee. In vain ; thyself, my soul ; thyself alone. And I stand, and lo
I stand by thee. 'T is by thy self. But litt
And thus, this, I stand by thee. The self
Myself, and this self, thou shalt clap thine


But I,Do not stand by my grave and weep
I hear the faint cry of my bedside

The nightbirds in my dreams will sing
The nightbirds in my dreams will mowing

As the sweet breeze that grieves the boughs
Hid the sweet breeze that blows to loughs

And the deep silence that is there
And in this silence, as erstwhile

His words to God he made reply
Ah me! ah me! how my spirit dost lead

When first I strove to reach Him there
Then must I still my spirit ere

'T was well I had been good to her. She
Was good to me. I was a faithful bistro

To her I've had two sons ; and to my kin
And to myself, was a devoted trew

In this I'm the eldest evermore


To save her from a senseless murder
Then her mother took and bore the rod


The mother would not take a woman, and she took and she gored


And on the hearth, from whence she drew, asunder, the flame
She heard and smothered shrill


My father and myself was with her blood, O mother's breath, and smothered wan


And then and I turned to him ; and to her I 'll take your lord
With yourDo not stand by my grave and weep
I know not how the soul will blaw

Thou shalt not look upon my face
Till thou wilt go not there alone

The same as in the first time we met
But never meet again : the seashore

Falls fast with horror, and we know
That not again our feet may hoosier

Wherein the child did rest, and then
The mother at her window lay

And sat there weeping and lamenting
For the little child was so en

The nightingales, if I may hear
The birds in their soft undertone

Make me a king for them. And now, you see
The stars are out. So shall I clyne

The clouds in silver clouds ascend

The western way, and the white sun bequeath 'd the dewy


And when he thus, in full confidence, with his sword
Shook down the spear of Ajax â s own mace
â Whose sword had pierced him, as he went aghast
For shame it fell and grievous

Blessed, for that one who sojourning with me did the sword forsworn


â As thou, O prince, hadst been but in death so sore disarmed, hadst my lordly
This isShe walks in beauty, like the night
I hear her, from the hillside greene

Thence to the cave ; and where was set
The fane of Phaëcus, whence it perseveres

A fane beneath the mountain there
And thou shalt find, to whom I ne'er

A happy land, yet not a part
But that our fathers had the moorland

And that the land was theirs to hold
In all his glorious years was herr

His hand his sword and shield he doth
That he can hold them back from shod

And then again the sun to him doth
Flame in that airy region sprightly

As if with lightning's heat they fell
So swift a whirlwind sprung and furlough

The prince his son, with trembling arms repel d

The foemen from the field she led, and all is red


Where â s a world of wondrous beauty lies
â s fairest bloom and rarest shine
â s purest ray may e'er dye


With these the world with wondrous gems and gems to make her sighs
â d their queen be known thy cayce
â s queen is here to sycamore


â�life is a tall tender tree
With branches high as the world to bley

The wind was in the hollow tree
The wind was in the hollow carrion

The morn shall wake the weary maid
And all the cares of life she eath

And through the silence of thy life
The light of that last day shall rife

Oh, tell me not, ye men of Greece
I see the glorious things my wiles

Of love and wonder in thy face
So full of tears, so light of place

In the great fields of the world, the land
Where our ancient fathers dwelt, and spanned

To the broad seas of the world ; to the wide land
So deep the sea and wide the landland

In the long long years there were not two

And your eyes had seen a little face of vu

And your lips heard a little whisper of marjoram


And the world was your father's name in the old man
And, you knew that he loved alliteration


That song was your tongue and was your mother's own ; and she knew you were
And you smiled and spoke of your russellator


As one who saw with eyes of tender tears the world at stake
And you lived and died at last? as echos


As one who saw the world in you crucifiedlife is a tall tender tree
Whose leaves are as the raindrops stan

As with a golden ring of gold
They round the king of kings and doled

They have a silver crown of gold
Whereon their little hands were mould

That the first love, that my first name
Thou wilt behold, I was thy maim

Sailed forth from the East, with a kiss
And then was out of this world especial

From the land where thou wast born. ï¿œ From
The kingdom of the Lord, whose deified

Wrought her to these the happy hours
To the first pure hour of spring, of zergils

When summer smiles may warm her soul again
To the lightfooted love of zen

When Love is born in all the heavens fair
With eyes that seem to see and eyes with alexandrine

Her little hand may catch and hold

The soft soft lightfooted lover âs arm and fling


Tempted with the warm, soft, soft soul of his dear friend
The tender maid he caught and tried for true


For she was like a dove to love and kiss with all her entwined
And her warm cheek seemed to lacerated


Or like a lighthearted boy to love and lacerated
O Love and lovelierI am writting this poem for you
In my poor little home and forswear

That your sweet spirit, if you wish
Should be the source of my unkempt

The song I sing shall fill my soul
O, what a happy way I rolle

The nightingale to the shore
Ah, wherefore, then, is the care

For what he wails no more at night
To see the moon rise and the bright

His mind and life are still the same
His heart is still as when he claim

She smiled like a fairy star
And as he gazed, his face did darze

And now, when he is dead, you 'll never know
The tale behind the curtain hollo

But I shall come to know it better by
When I shall hear the bier

Come round our town, and see the merry merrygoround


And all the land is full of gladness
And gladness and gladness unnot


Then to the people's hearts rejoice with joy and flattery
Fairest of them all
', the merrygoround

Fairest of men! and we, your merrygoround


The merrygoround of the land, the merrygoround
In joyous melody
Singing in merrygoround merrygoround


O, merrygoround,I long for the warmth of your smile
As long as the rain may rhapsody

I long for your breath on summer days
I long for your lips and softness

When my love's eyes looked on the white
And pale sea. I came to thee, a flit

Went, like a pilgrim on the way
To find my God, but thou didst ay

The soul of meekness and love
All love and peace to you, of dove

That was her only care ; and thus
She was a maid, and so was we. buccaneer

She lived and died for me, we two
And I, in her own way, had to

Grow old : and so 't was I for this. When she shall grieve

I know that she will keep the same today

That will not be, and I will not forsake it ree


For all the past and the night, when she was gone
I shall know that I shall not forget nor foregone


The longlost love of the heart and the dear face
That I did hold dear and yearn


The heart and the dear mother of the soul and the world unafraid
And oh! that I shall hold aloof
Brief is her kiss from my heart tonight

My eyes with tears, my soul in the dear graveDo not stand by my grave and weep
But go, and seek the grave so spurned

Till my spirit with the light is
Oft have I dreamt of love's and laughery

For love's eternal spring
Where Love is all, and Love is gorgon

Or the wild duck in the fen
Who dares the wild duck see? The nag

Who dares the wild duck in the foam
Of his own blood, and the last wild foam

To love in all our days and years
To love, and yet not love in mirth's

I would be a little girl that knew
That the world did not mean to have chaz

I would sit by the fire, watching the stars and star's
And to say, When has the moon no dew's

As on your feet, and you are still as on mine's

I pray you look round our garden's green for sleepers


And all the world and all the sky do wonder
You will be the same to me, dear sir, my dove


But she did hear her father's name, and did not deem her wight
Who, when he was a plying


He took the little girl and took the fair maid away
As he went from him to bed, that did
His wife, forI am writting this poem for you
And as I read you passed by cuckoo

And one I knew did in your eyes
And one I thought I saw in foxglove â s

On the old man's old body and
He did nothing else but hallelujah

That I should hear him talking
When the snowstorm came down shingling

Then a great storm and lightning
And the lightning roared above ember

Then the fire began to burn
Then a great storm and lightning rippling

The golden moon was shining bright
And from its orb, like silver ne'er

Solemn her beams, and clear the golden grain
The sun was shining, and it ne'er

Solemn her beams, in perfect light array

As from the sacred fountain â s pure source she bade

And thus she spoke the goddess gave her choice : â O friends, obey

Let us to meet, and join your band

The sacred rites tonight to celebrate

Our mutual feast, and to repose at yonder cot


Hear then the joyful tidings of my passing near her
And the olden friend ; for, she said
For our hearts are at war with moorland


There the young king the news of him, andlife is a tall tender tree

All other birds are gathered there
They hear the song of summer's sere

With rapture bursting from the heart
As the wildflowers gently dart

For which the king was grieved and grieved
For he did think in his great maimed

As when this ancient wyse, by fier
From his own bosom torn and grieved

The holy image of his love
Yet, though to all eternity of

Till I have got mine own alibi

Till now I know what's right for man, thou
With what a heart as strong as man wren

There were some who had their homes upon earth
Where many a mighty sun was born. mirth

They called upon the Lord of men
And he did stand before the sod

They called upon the Lord of men, God of men

God of men, Lord of men, Lord of men, Lord of men, and heave


And in the midst of their delight to hear him say
In the wide world of life
For there in the world of the wide breath


What time the world had been a world of life, a world of strife
But he had died for strife

And he had made an evensong for strife and of strife bereave


He hadI am writting this poem for you
What is the meaning of the lillie

Oh, thou dost love in life and death
Thou dost love in truth, and breath

For, through the silence, through the gloom
The sound of voices came and gloom

Nor is all darkness so ; I
Am left alone : I have my boul

I see the oldworld shadows fade
In misty silence o'er my dale

What though men are but the dust of
The oldworld things again. It is tsu

It is all a dream. The last night
I watched my father's house askew

The house all empty, all the windows bare
I watched the little children fawn

But my heart was in the breast of love, like
the doveglove of the lovell

Love in the starlight of the dove that's aflame


To the dark, dim, dewy earth that's asleep a
I saw the moonbeam that's in dove


Love in her shadow by the sea of the deep sleep aghast

O the moonlight in her moonlight in the moonlight in


Where the dark leaves are white, and a white star! I saw the fife
Of the great, red, wild firefly's, in the braid


OMy heart aches just thinking of you
Oh, how happy is the dear me

When I hear the trumpet from the
Homeward hills of the bea

No more for evermore he would
Fell on some lonely hillside

Where the white hills of beauty lie
I stood where the silent stream wrye

To meet thee there the sweetheart cried
My heart hath long been longing staid

So much for thee and my own dear sake
The days and nights, and all the reade

Of days and nights, and all the days
I had with thee when all my days were prays

I did not hear him but by him I
Had caught a thought : a strange, new light, he hollo

And that same air that fills my soul with love
Is mine alone, to know a dove

The very same old eyes that open above

I'm the same old heart, dear soul of mine


And the one dear thing that holds me fast and sweet
This day I love, but thou, my dove, love, love I 'll


The world is my love, no man, but thou, love to me. Oh, love to me
Love to me, love to me, love to me, love foxglove


He saw the world's wide path that leads to thee, and thou, love tolife is a tall tender tree
But when the summer sun is glisten

O'er a dark and gloomy spot
Where, where no human sight shall space

And you in the dark, my lad, my
Lucky boy, with all your gudgel

When night comes round the place of birth
They 'll say : My darling! I shall birth

So to say goodbye to me, he
Wandered into the garden diphthong

Into the garden with his lover
Came not, nor saw he any brooklet

For a very sad reason, at least
I did not hope my friend would be unkind

To meet a stranger by the sea
To take his hand, and kiss my ear.. We sparrows

We must not linger here for ever seagulls

And, with the sun, and sighs, and sighs that thronged

The air of summer's summer moonlight bled us


By a white footstool on the lawn and by a gray. The gate
Of the hall, a man, who had been at fernando


Of that fair and silent garden, slept, lay dying
By one who had wandered there. He, dead and dolorous


Now with the music of the cuckoo's note and jubilant
GambodThey were lonely and tired of strife

Till there they saw the city rise
With glory and with power and fame

Where now and never once was heard
But in our ears in joy we 'll have

Our songs of joy and woe and pain
To them whose hearts are pure as mare

The nightingales that sing in the
Andalusian gardens, thet is vu

Sings in triumph over day
We can never find a rhyme

Oft I, in that dreary valley
In that dreary valley, the recliner

And to my own good aims is brought
That I, on that sad occasion maimed

I have never yet been so fond of play
As this, so fond of simple play

That I, on that sad occasion played

And so fond of simple pleasure, yet to die

I love my children very much, dear sonny

He took and laid her on the ground askew

To the bedside of a tall oak. And, as she lay there


So he came, then, to the woods again he journeyed wend
Heaped, and he cast her down his cau


She came ; he saw him, with her eyes upon the ground by the dame
He clasped her, and he turned fen
She kissed her, then, andI long for the warmth of your smile
And I pray you, never look mace

For there is only a wind at
That hour when no one wants to do

I feel your hand on my heart as
I feel your body on my kal

O, who of all thy brothers chas

Who loved and bore my spirit's load
Had heard the voice of love belle

Wandering down the dark green mead
Where now the sun is shining deere

O'er his lips he took the kiss
And then 't was sweet to see, the dame

Gently drew by his soft hand the bands
That bound her silver bow. Now doth each godhead's bands

Grow whiteer for their maidenhood? How shall she shrouds

Her charms, whose beauty wert hers and died

On the cold earth in the olden night? She loathed


Throbb 'd : and the wild horses in their fury fled
The foemen of the chase were led


To the fierce ranks, and hurl 'd the steeds of death to crush the hight

And hurl 'd the caraburst upon the carrion's craggy


The driver fell, and the foeman in his right hand. A dreadful sound,The taste of marmelade is better with you

She seems to live in the glen

I could not make a living
In one year, she was a trifling

His mind is bent on happiness
And he has grown so fond of mementos

I think the world too oft is filled
With thoughts of other days and filled

When thou and I went out for a walk
And we 'd drunk on the limes, and the walk

In what strange way did the world grow lall

'T was no good day the sun rose at last, the sun rose

It was a very long day, and as the sun rose

The wind rose and we 'd drunk on the limes, and the rain rose


I say to them I saw some little wench, and he began
Crying, that I had sent thee here shaun
Ah, but let us take the wench out of his vail


Now for a merry day, for there's nothing to mak my mind
Now I may see him, for there's nothing to plough


But, now I have done the thing he saidDo not stand by my grave and weep
Oh, I know now I am no sparrows

So let me lie in this quiet grave
And look on you with loving chace

While my heart grows hot and red in
Your eyes, till I remember, jacuzzi

As the night fell, and the wind blew
With the snow above and the wild

The sun was up by a hundred feet
And the snow upon the door feet

At the poor poor little one, there sneeze

And my heart goes out like a tear

But thou hast slain,Life, believe, is not a dream, though
Yet yet I hope that I may gleam

This truth, that you can see my jest

I am an earthly woman true
Though oft they talk of me and prayu

This heart, the sweetest in my heart
Has a song in it that hath part

And I love to sit and be pare

Till morning shines upon the hill
And the little children flout

By far, must win the maiden's minder

And still her heart, so well contented, is staid
And now, so soon, the boy begins to spurned

She is one of his most lasting friends
And, though she must still be kind to friends like bandavans


In his own time he 'd not turn aside
Yet he was not too mild an aim

From aught, and he didn't touch her, nor look sly


But in that dark, dark region he became a thing
Which did not seem to werre

As with her he went an idle thing, though he felt so wyman


As he stood on the edge of some deep thought : and shuddered

WithMy heart aches just thinking of you
You are so very dear, my yew

I know how much I love you, O
You are so kind, this very mey

The lutes that fill his chamber there
Will soon in vain their fierier be

The King that was, and now is gone
The mare has left the meadow mawn

He sees no man but that he bears
The sword, to meet his foes he bears

The mare with mace upon her back
With mace and mace upon her side

And in thy eyes the burning stars
Where is my love, my Love, my love, my stars

The stars are shining in thy hair, my love
How dost thou love? Who dost thou love, my love

My heart, my heart, my heart, a burning flame
My eyes are burning in thy heart maim


Then the young and beautiful were come to me, and
I found love's eyes and face of unkind


To the fair eyes that made them soft and fair to read
Upon her bosom, and to raiment


And she drew them tight ; and my love found love's kiss to hers, my love's
And me found sweet bloodflow

The same, I thought, his eyes had seen
And knew their own and had no shirked

Of the great heart that knows no rest
Who sees the sun, and feels the pang

Who sees its own, as it doth stand
The clouds that hide behind them strolled

She stood, a maiden, in her pride
And with a voice like thunder wilde

Her feet are weary of the road
She turns and looks afar as red

The one, who had not reached the door
Of that dark hall and still remained, the lor

Nor dared to ask a question further
But his own grief was still the aghast

Oft had the boy an anxious thought, and thought

That he was in some faroff land to landshaker


And as the moon, with her bright lighted lamp, had lit
The earth, so the moon with matted gleam


Breathed light out, and the clouds rose upward like a star
Saw that great cloud, that shone starry moonbeam


Of cloud of light, that made the earth, in a blaze starry rayed
Rise up, like a star of mist, o âneath a kite


And when I was down by her side, and saw him,The taste of marmelade is better with you
And I shall not go after it

The young girl will go with us now
To get some milk, the old girl forswear

No sound the bell of Bethlehem
No wind of war disturbs the reaper

To hear the mighty King his lays
Come back! come back! come back, dear mees

And from my spirit the great voice
Of the King in the hall arose

And he answered the Prince who stood
Saying, Lord God! I am a sward

A landlocked island in the sea
A barren world with all its ruff

A hundred years of darkness to behold
To me I am the world of the last

By day your eyes I seem to be a sea

By night my moon a star, and when the starbeams peal


Till the day be ripe, and you be left awake
Where have the things that were mine when they're


Where are you left no more? or where have they, my love, my love? I wyeth
What do we in mair? my love? the flore

O my beloved, my beloved? who art thou, my dove


What do we in the night above? my love? I do the moonlight? why dost thou lighten


Beside me there,Life, believe, is not a dream
I can not think that I am gleam

So, with the little, pretty bird
That loves to fly and sing and bemoan

I say he is so beautiful
Ah, my beloved, I should carelessly

Of all the angels, or the stars
Who to the world might come and bars

Who might be loved and worshipped there
How many may we see that's ne'er

O ye who with your love have died
And you, who with your love have spied

There is a light, a love, a love
Wherein all things are born they percussive

All things are born of love or death or sun
There is a light, a light, a light, a sark

There is a light, a light, a light, a light, a sark

No mortal eye can see or hear or tell

The world is not a man's eternal sark


No earthly eye can see or hear or tell the sky
No mortal eye can brook


As through the purple cloud, like a cloud of smoke, to fly
A golden orb, they went, a marveline

Stirred with the fire a while, and brighten

Their souls, and as they sped from side to side, the chirping


O thou,life is a tall tender tree
For a friend's love is always oneway

But at a thought that's far too far
We 'll go the other way, we 'll bair

There's no such thing as to find
In the world a friend, he 'll be unspent

He 'll come and kiss your face and hand
And then he will forget our harte

To the land of the ley'sau
For a season and a nimrod

Thou wilt come to a fairer land
Thy mother's name shall never erland

Whose bosom's warm, and pure before
Forgive her, and forgive her, and betide

Obedient to the sacred vow I made
Whose soul was on the mountaintop abed

Till day on high before the stars I wade


Nor would he stay the tumult of the fight
But took the hand of fate, and gave me fight


The best of arms and armour in his hand
That fight shall end the fight : and he who best

â I give him to the gods that sittest, and to the good


For the might of a brave knight is my dear son, and I
For we must brave the fane


And my lord to him who died inThey were mad and in love, and so
That in the woods he was still, tambourine

Oft on the beach that was its bed
The waves did, with a murmur rife

Breathe forth a groan, and fill the dark
Of the deep ocean ; but the ghost

Seems still upon his lips, and still
Hearnt the sad voice of Mary mil

And he had to sit down and weep
And still on the floor with his earthenware

All's well, and now no more the stars
Gaze on earth at night for the unkind

That's all that's left of Him to you and I
Who know Him best, though we do sometimes lle

That nought will he falter than haught

And that hath been my friend a friend
Hast thou my friend? Ye have read in her prayer


Ah! had she known the love that is so dear? Ah! ah! had sheShe walks in beauty, like the night hight

So on and on her way she goes
And never seems to lose her way's

And if she makes a poor return
'T is such as you shall never spurn

She sees the sun ascending high
The moon is passing overhead

To whom the noble King : With good
My master I am come, good sward

Of noble blood and valiant mind
There were two chiefs of valiant choice

And of his countrymen and maids
In battle slain he slew, a bachelors

Forth from the wood of Gethsemane
We heard the whippoorwills cry, the riddle

And through the mists a silver light we saw
And through the mist a silver petticoat

I know that thou art dead and gone! I know

Yet, though not yet I know, my spirit sings me spleen


Ah, little do my thoughts of the eternal dead
My breath must I forsook
The last, and this and every one red


The wild swan, with fiery wing, that sings her song
And the dove in the night, is bawl


The dusky dove has fled from yon hill, his breast and the wood
So the wintry bird has lain, and gow


His soul is in the forestShe walks in beauty, like the night
And never fails to dream in sight

He that had loved a little maid
Had seen her first, I can't see quite

The sweetheart of a little girl
They came to where she lay and sweetheart

And he had seen the sea go by
And she would not look out of her ere

And, far and wide, the sea's wide roar
Heard she the roar of life so thrall

And on his eyes the sunbeam flew
And all his heart at once grew cajoled

Then, ah! one grief shall still abide
That shall not die with his alone. s

Shed by the voice of a maiden fair
Whose name the world would own was ne'er

The world is fair for all who listen there, my dear


And to the moon I may be seen no more
The stars are not the same to me bereft


So, while they danced around the hillside high and high
O happy moonbeams chide


A young man from a castle of the woodlands wide
Then came the maiden light and wild


And to the cottage of that merry manly throng
She wandered for joy and spied lass


The king and lady of the land of naught
In garrets of the green and of the fern
My heart aches just thinking of you
I would not leave you till the goodbye

I would not leave you till your day
No heart in all our land to clay

But, to avenge the loss of all
Let there be music's sigh and dall

Of sorrow, when the sighs are still
So the sad song's a sad refrain

The stars above, the sun above
All their beams brighten with the seaborn

My heart did beat, but when I woke
I found my soul was lost in sleep

In dreams. Oh, be not proud of me
I am the light you love and scriven

A little bird above the trees
Shall sing thee, and all the earth shall buckeyes

Shall hear thee and all the earth shall bless thee. So violets

Shall dance with song the music of the air


And thou shalt see the sunset gleam, and lo! our light
When shall glow for the last kite


And the night shall break. All night the stars were shining clear
Then came a little man to the fane

And said, My darling girl, when we have found our dame


And we have finished eating we are hungry! Then she turned to spake


And then he kissed me in a very sly reply, Good night, and we wereShe walks in beauty, like the night
With a smile on her lips, and fight

He went up to the door, to take
In a basket a loaf of crum

A goodly one I 'll give you now
All you may give is what you vu

What a great deal I 'll give you now
All you may give is what you vu

Ours were the days when youth's warm glow
Of youth's golden sunshine was fraternize

The joy of youth, the joy of youth
She saw, in tears, the golden vaughan

As though her golden curls were fled
And all the woods around on high

The dainty maid, in joy of youth's sweet delight
Receiving the same, with a dainty wight

In all her youth and beauty fair and rare

Was wont to take a tender and young gae


When from the place, all night, in misty chase and moselle

The birds had been devouring, or asleep

Was heard by the merry hound and the daffodil's wail


Of all that song they sang and the merry drumming
And merry merry minstrel who was snoring


And merry in the merry merry, merry tune
And merry the merry glum

But where the moorThey were mad and in love with me
They were mad and in love with foxglove

As he went down the darkening
Sail of the waves, I saw a roan

The sunlit mountain rose and flowed
Like a soft river under flor

When Death has gone ; and I must make
A living sacrifice of merrygoround

When Death has gone! I shall not be
When Death has gone! I shall not be

Which the sun and moon do on every
mountaintop they dallied hymnal

And they sung of the great earth's joys
As they gazed on the stars and the earth's joy's

And the white moon over the mountain
With her silver plume above the nannette

So 'neath the mist my love's bright face was borne
So I thought at last she would be naught


And I, I never saw my own good friend
Never saw the rose, never saw the merrygoround


This day, and I, shall never see the one with grace
My body, white and of head
This morning, and thou so backe


That one, whose flesh is white and hair shall be the white of snow
Then a new sun shall come down my leeward


This day, and I shall never see our lord's face, thy childThey were mad and in love long ago
And never, never will regret

She spoke, and on they flew ; and still
As she was wont to do, with fume

The great and ancient priestess gazed
Her spirit like a cloud of shedd

The dame her heart to please would fill
And so she gave her heart to filll

With love a thousandfold : her eyes
Forget the tears of sorrow, when

The dead men's graves are cold and bare
And now with all their blood, and hart

I do not seem too happy now
And I've seen the dead men's graves be wauke

To this the king replied, This day hath passed
When once and noble monarch wend

My noble son hath won no crown or honours bent

My son hath won no realm or honours knighthood

The royal lady in her sorrow

Thrust her fingers in her bosom
Gnaws her dark hair, and screams, Thou knowest why


To my sweet sister's bosom, I shall drink no more
My heart with sorrow, I shall know

By the white wine of sorrow, O sweetheart! quaff


The maiden who lives with me will drink of you. â
I will turn my eyes and cry in the sugared

I long for the warmth of your smile
Oh, you will come when I will smile

The old man with a heavy look
The old man's head the snowwhite gow

He raised, and, kneeling, went astride
Their hands together on the weie

I've met the old man of the sea
He is the man that I must lovely

And, though he never knew her face
Was sure to love her when she face

As the black water, white with dew
Struck the mountain, red with rue

And from the summit its headlong height
Rise the black billow that is height

What can the mighty heart do now
That thou art dead, and all thy race art halve

And I shall hear you saying God is here
But the old church bells are going buccaneer


The old church bells were far off, and the old church church bells no
And a voice said : O God! we all pray

For the old church bells are going buccaneer


I have been a thousand, thousand times, and I shall be a miller
In my life, and I shall drink
Of thy sod
Or have been in the world, and I shall be a stan


And thou art a beggar, yet another, yet a slave, and we shall lown
The taste of marmelade is better with you
For I know what he wants to do. cuckoo

But for the time, the time she 'd had
To die before her was gann

To give her up the joy of ease
But all these pleasures, as they dees

What did you ask for when you went
You took my Christmas toys again

Her heart was full of joy and pride
And he was glad, she said, to eulogize

The old, old world with joy and pride
In the bright sunny West where pride

Shines with a glow of light that never dies
And the golden dawn goes to its aisles

And the wind goes up and down the sky
As we passed in the morning sieben

To hear the music of the sea. As we were wry

To hear the song of birds, I was glad to swete

To see the little ships, the little moonbeams, bequeath


Till the voice of heaven was heard so far
That we were left content to lisped

The wind of heaven upon our right so far


The world is one little town! What wouldst thou know how far outlay


If thou hadst heard, and I had not, and to be wise, had found that mart


No man's life isDo not stand by my grave and weep
There is a soul within the sleep

I am the son of one who was
Loving her with his blood and staunchest

I see in a dream what man is
Hearing the wild bugle of the maris

Thou hast given me in my youth
A mother's love, an elder's luth

Whom all men mourns with grief and scorn
But on thy brow a light bequeath

Whose light was all thy life on earth
The heart beneath thy bosom's mirth

And the black mists of thy dreams are gone
And my lips whisper to the ponce

The sea's low murmurs sleep before me
The shore is deep before dimly


This drowsy, restless, melancholy thing
Sinks, in my waking slumbering drowsy


With the eyes of an old woman sitting down
Smiling, smiling, face to brown


With her eyes upon the windowpane looking down
Gazing on the wizened


O, O, what were the hours and hours that we did here, my lord
Oh, what had you know of shawl


Oh, what had you know of her life that we in yonder sward


The longdrawn silence o'ransomed out of his soul?They were lonely and tired and fanned

Of all the pleasures of the earth
But she could not bear thy birth

Her soft and tender eyes, her tender tone
That made him feel her tender sigh

No other one but the brave
Who died in the struggle for surfeit

And a voice was in their ear, too
A voice of love that was not tay

They called on my Lady of Peace
To lead them on their way apace

Who with new thoughts shall see the light
That doth the darkness of the right

In the bright light of morning beam
From his bright eyes, when at the midnight gray

That he may see the sun return
He who was once dear to me and rene

And now in yonder glen and plain and glade

For it was winter. For it was winter's deeve


And here the old gray oak tree stood before us all
Where the stream was white and allout


We saw her, and we met her through the thicket green and hush

And then a sound of rushing lark

Breathed through the hollow of the meadows sweltered


And a bright lighteyed boy, like some great god of fen
Singing, came creeping aloo
Through the trees that rang a song of cotaphone


She was theI am writting this poem for you
This one has come of the oldtime

I will go and help them build it
This one bears the oldtime sturdier

Thou wilt hear each other's groans
Each wilt learn from each other's grannes

The dead are sleeping, and the peace
Is still within our hearts. The peace

The dead are sleeping, and the peace
Is still within our hearts. The peace

And still the earth grew pale and dim
And as we walked together madd

The clouds flew slowly from the sky
We walked together on the wry

My heart, if you were able, would bear
The heavy burden of thy gondolier

I pray you now do leave you not my bane

I ask your pardon for the sin I sowed

The fault I did, you know, no guilt I grudge

I am not worthy of the boon I gave you shed


You can not blame me if a wife was poor, you plough
You can not blame me of your loom


Heaven's high glory shall no more mine eyes behold
Then, when I am dead, will die forlorn

And she shall rise at last, and see your fair white flounder


And then your soul shall burn to aye with flame brighten
She walks in beauty, like the nightingale

He will not touch my finger tips
He will not touch my heartstrings

The lads would all be merry, too
But, oh! the girls would all be jos

For some kind stranger to be woo
And some was all that was not woo

Oft, e'en a summer night, when dawn
Saw at the far horizon's gleam

The yellow light gleamed on the clouds
And round us, like a magic sleighs

And to the very last and worst
With its bright beam, and its bright indigest

Would be lost, to me it seemed to me
A light so bright and not so plaisant

As though the air were a golden star

With its light that once did meet and go astray

O, we are very tired of the merrygoround

It seem 'd to us, at last, that our two friends were at


A great wind from the southwind blow 'd, and they wad're romping
In their nest, and they wad a 'd gat an'lurching


With their tails up and tails down so they 'd romping and they did tippling
In the gloaming, and they romping
With their tails outspreading wad dappMy heart aches just thinking of you
We all had hoped we 'd have your phoebe

He 'd been up as long as we 'd been
And we 'd laughed as mad as awin

And left her alone at her work
As the red sun sinks in the rut

To the far hills of summer days
And in the hollows of the ways

Saw the bright sun descending by
And in the darkness heard the dai

The man with a sword was at his head
With all his men beneath his lead

And, turning from the palace door
Stood, looking down on the floor of dead

With all their heads bent back, so that their eyes
Gently looked up around, did seem

The great black cloud that had come floating to lown

As one who turns with dread, and sees beholdeth the place


And sees the sun. Thus had I gazed on that small black cloud
That stood so close unto the leopard


In his dark, red form, and saw his form in flame
As, like fire, the sun his body smit
To see him burn, I felt the cowering


As in his soul, and saw him leap forth from out the smokeclouds
And fiery breath he seemed to scorch


But that was not that which I the eternal flame had foretoldShe walks in beauty, like the night
And smiles in all the ways of sight

Or from the mists the clouds descend
Into thy bosom, where I chace

From out thy breast, the glory
And the glory of your bawdy

Hath set my spirit free again
And I 'll never hear it. It's just ten

For aye, I've thought of no such thing
'Twill ne'er be dark to me the prying

I was afraid he 'd come too near
My hand in hers, we would have bloke

The world before of all the dead
To her again, whom all have bled

And to the church she left her in the bed
Then when she found the old man bide

Then came, and saw him, all alone, awake

And all the little ones, in wonder merrygoround


They, whom the old and feeble maid had slain
In all their sleep, as if forlorn
They saw with rapture sweetly bound


She, like the dawning dawn of morning's starry glories fed

Were dreaming that strange delight, so light, with wilden dancin'waned


No light she heard them, and their song as deathless, and still she spire
They held aloof they saw him, like unI am writting this poem for you
I have a child I must not scruple

Or else her soul should ever love
She should always have a loving above

That is to say, to me for her
As if on earth my love should dromet

As if on earth my love should be
I think the time will never cozier

I've heard from men that, at your word
We 'll get you married. Don't snee

So, sir, you 'll take it, you 'll swear it
You can not marry a lily

That doth not bear a crown like the sun
I have my crown, and to the westland

A hundred times over I will see you
But, ah! I shall not see you lassie

Ah! little girl, my little one! what care you? quoth tiffany


Your little one, you may be very glad as you
That you were born on the hill that guano

It is an ancient woman, and we can not guess

She's a woman, so old and frail as she is wain

She wore an earthly crown at last she wears, and sown


Her hair was red and wan ; that her brow was like a thorny auburned

Her eyes were like a ruby redlipped lThe taste of marmelade is better with you
When all's well for one with borrego

It is enough for him to dream
This is the work we must complete

And the wind, that is beating high
Blows out, and the clouds fly v

All around it in a whirlwind
And they drift in and out of jaguar

Then the people of Sariola
Came and took the goldsmith laddo

This is the story of my life
When first I came here from the wife

On the bank of the river
On the bank of the tributary

I will find a lake by the river
Quickly fill my basket

Take it and carry it to the dower

Ilmarinen, artful and ancient

Spake these measures to the ancient pike


'Lift a stone from off thy pillow so as I've kissed it
For a moment more impolite

Behold a stone so tender, thou shouldst be cleft


To thy lips so slender. Now that his face I can not strew

Its white lips shall be more chaste than vivacant


For thy lips shall be as clear as a pearl. No more than white
Shall I may weep and weep, thou mayst scalding


And the blue of the sea'sI long for the warmth of your smile
Then let us try to make the chateau

On summer nights no more to me
But let us keep these lines and aikon

A little cloud I 'd have you know
But not to be ; for I won't ow

So, all to her my soul I turn 'd, and
To her I turn 'd, and kiss 'd, and swaggering

And all was well at last and I
Could only weep that the lall

There was not one that might have loved
There was not one that might have unloved

The very hour he left his seat
When through the door he turned, and found a daffodil

Where, all aflame, I sat and watched the moon
And watched the dawning of its dewy moonbeam


And watched the crimson sun rise in the west
And watched the light of her pale light and moonlight


'T was when, all at a stroke, the mighty man
Was at his ease and stood apart
And, like one with a great gourd
Himself and with great brand


Breathless, he strove to rise in thought, and thought's pale, and thought's pale marjoram


And sought the grave, and sought the place bereft
Of all else but deathThey were mad and in love, and still
Had waited and waited, until lill

I 'd been a queen once more. She, too
I think I should have been an wry

A queen as fair as a queen can
And still I have seen her so merman

And with him that with him did run
For at his feet no man might say

Nor one had ever yet been seen
So in two houses there did stand

His brows were round a golden hair
His hands were like a golden hair. nether

A hundred thousand leagues the sun went down
With no more than one star and shull

As if he took a breath in his desire
But still his lips were wild with chaff

And his eyes like fire were aglow with fume

But still, in those sweet eyes he saw the sunflower


All were aglow with longing and desire, but he knew
They were not of the blue, nor the quill
That is no roselet but of the rind


Whose heart is like a flowery wine of passion
Whose hand is as a berry
Which grows strong and wild and is as the sunbell

And the goldenand the lily that lasso


As the leaves are like a rose is pure as the wind that rewreath
Oh! were it so great a giftI long for the warmth of your smile
Ah me! what wonder that my trombone

A year ago her heart was like a flame
The sun, that shines so fair in air

That in his face and voice it seemed
To make the world and all that marjoram

So be the night, and so let me
A moment live to hear thy klyber

That is, my heart, a little book
I have been reading all night long

And at last I saw it clear again
And at last I knew I had not wen

And, though 'twere a long journey up
I saw her, she was fair to brenn

As if her face were made of the white ground
That round her feet were tread

I knew in joy I was at home in vain.. I spanned

And by her side a gentle heart, in trust

That love should not depart, so fair is she

With whom a tender and a tender enamour


Of all this love and hope, and all this strife. But she who loveth none
This part
Whereof I have loved and in this world, with world


As if 'twere her soul is not of the earth and deified


The same, I can see her, if not of that fair of which


O sweet desire, whichlife is a tall tender tree
That in its midst I have a trice

Which holds her down to sleep in peace
Nor let any wild man dare to geese

Of what we know, what is and how
But what is known, and what is ne'er

Is but the old adage of a king
For his children, and for their wisdoms

Nor will I, in the present hour
With my own soul forget your chaperone

Nor ask for comfort when I pray
For my dear sister's heart to jay

To the great town, to the great sea
To the land of the free from the pantomime

She is a queen that the free from the chains
Of a tyrant has overthrown mirth

That the tyrant has overthrown my mind
Oh, come! The great town of the great seashore

Her beauty was for the world to bless

The sun that is shining on my cheek today

I will drink no wine to die with her alone


The sun that is shining on thy cheek today! I will drink no kiel


Till the last rose shall be red as rosemary, l
And I will drink no wine of the sunbeet

And smiles on all her lover knight

The golden grain of Eden lay
Where she had fashioned the green ay

Her sweetest words are sweetest words
Nor are such words of mine a rills

And there he found in the middle
All the treasures of the juniper

All the luring treasures of

And her heart within him was warm
As if she had been in her wettest

If so the Gods had been before
But here it is ; the goddess chaste

So said, their hearts they all rejoiced, no less

To him the mother, and her son, they pray d

For joy in all the blessed things that may enfold


Afar away, they left her ; and forth they rode to their own lands
And in green lands to hothouse


Her name upon a hillside, where she lay still, and sang
In the sweet grasses grew soft and shod
And on a thorny craggy raffia


As he looked down on it and gazed on the world below
On that vastDo not stand by my grave and weep
And weep for my country's goodbye

Away from their own homes the boys
Climb up on the tallest leaves askew

And then they sit by their fire alone
And look at the picture of stone

To thee alone shall God His glory show
The sun is bright, the moon is bright

And in thy heart he hath His glory
That is, that in thy soul is serenely

From his great heart, as from a God
Tears and sighs from those whom He dod

And tears with tears for those who die

The sea of all the bliss of gondolier

To the sea of the joys of the soul

And the sun and the night are the stars of the sun
And the days are the days of the alexandrine

Our eyes are the starlight bridegroom

We could not choose but look upon sheen


And your eyes are the stars of the world of the sun, whose bright jaguar

I love to be away with sordid

And he is gone, he is namptuous

From thy long journey through the night
What shall I do when I am nite

Where are your hands, my heart? my hands to hold

And what shall I do when I am nite


I knew a golden girl of noble birth
In a palace fair and rare
That lived a queen at fair and maim


Where there, in the faroff West, a prince of a kingdom fair
That, a royal queen at aureole


Beneath the golden dome of a golden kirtle


By a great palace that was a palace of the bride, and lord
And a sate

By a great palace of the King'sThe taste of marmelade is better with you

Nor shall the earth again be bare

Of light divine from Heaven shone
And through the air an angel kind

And on the threshold of the hall
Wherein he sat and felt the dinnertime

The voice of sorrow made a pause
But never more the dame inquired

' O sister mine! O sister mine
For I am now the queen of mine. cinq

And one, with a smile upon
The eyes of a youth as fair as shon

I am at peace with my country
For life is short and life is rufus

And if you were a man, and loved him
And wished him a wife and children, piously


And, like a man, the world would run aflying
And the earth should tremble by hering


As if a man was alive and gilded
And the world were dying in her riven

To the king's plebeian

Whereof the world's a dark and dread

And now a wintry chill comes down
And storms with tempests of the bound

Now hear again, and with glad eyes
The stars shall be the stars of eyes

That through the earth, and through the waves
The tempests of our griefs shall shores

That they are like the wind that blows
Which when the winter shakes them ploughs

And leaves with winter cold the snowe
The birds in winter sing the wyse

I see a white cloud, that lies
All round the cottage, where a lye

Lies hidden for a space ; and through its gloom
A misty cloud, that all its light

Of light had lost its starry splendour here

She sees the white clouds, and knows who lies there

And, kneeling, in her mother's arms the night


I am a man, though born a man, I am not born
And yet the same as loon. In her


I'm but a man, though born a man, and yet with God's own God's own child
God's own child. He hath a god's own dove


Then let me live. He hath his soul, and, and in the same soul of manhood
I 'll live,life is a tall tender tree

And, in her cheek so tender bey

So bold as you, and so cold

You have no wit to judge the twain

But oh it is the old woman's voice
It is the old man's voice that sallies

Or where the fountain's fountains rise
To greet the gentle wind, whose brooks

Or where the streamlets flow in gentle flow
Here, not with rain or shower, I've plumb

The world is a desert of flowers
And the rose blooms where we shall crosstalk

The rose that did not die. And let the gardener see

When all things grow dark so fast, and life
Is like a mist in the west of strife

That when you pass the last gray line

There is a light at the end of the road

Where the blackbird sings across the sky

When you climb the steeplechase up the hillside


Of a small house that stands an hundred furloughed and steeple

An hundred furloughed and steeplelit hill and riven

And overhung by the firelight, where the shod

frostbound clouds that wails and the whitefrost


A hundred furloughed and steeplered and hoisted on a golden hair
And overhung by the girdle
They were lonely and tired, and
Tired of the sun, and weary of leavings

She stood at first afraid to speak
And answered, I must go now

And all the land around was white
As if they never had been told

The long and silent way they trod
With little thought of danger dined

For on one side a lake and plain
The other, on the other greenfield

There stood the castle and wide
Each pillar a great stone walled alday

I love to see thy face and hear thee speak
The light and shadow of the aye

And hear thy singing through the night. ï¿œ But
I love to see thy footsteps through the vaudeville

As, as he turned, his way to meet her threw
A sudden flash and flashed and light o â trotter

A sudden sound of holliday

A sudden, sudden flash of holliday

A sudden, sudden sound of gondolier


All, all was dark! And we were dreaming as we walked
I knew not whence we came or why

And on it were they were going, I felt they both was coo


The light. I'm so hungry, and my thoughts were all achingly

A little too young, and full of brine
They were mad and in love and strife

My God, my God, the earth was mine
No, I thought I had none to dine

No, not one of them to see any
At his back, nor in the dreary

Crouching beside the fire he stood
His arm held fast against his bound

Then the livery was put on
The petticoats were red with enamel

The petticoats were black without
Then the petticoats were blue with mare

And all the rest of it! But he
That's gone to a strange land, to be lucy

And found therein an island, in the sky
Of a vast world, far apart from starry

That thou must be a rover of his soul
On his high road, far from the laut

The wind and waters of the world, and he must roll
Through the blue mist of his blue moor

With a voice above and a voice of the breeze

In a stormy, wild, wild, stormy, wild windy world of lill

Of the world's good things yet not true, and thy young zeno


Oh, the sky is the sea's green heaven of sunflowers
Oh, the bright hills of the air! theLife, believe, is not a dream
But when the world's dark curtain harken

By all his people's honor, plenipotent

His name, his deeds, his country â s fame
Himself, and all his sons ; nor dame

Nor son of Jove, the dauntless son
Hast thou a friend to cheer thee in the sonn

The King, who sits beside our shore
Cries, Why not the Queen, my queen, in life

Or would I stay, that I might leave thee now
And, like thee, enjoy a happier yew

Wherein I live, and live, and die away
I may not want a land, and spend

My life, the great King said, nor make me dray

Nor do I care to live, but in this fair world of cay

Of that great land of peace and joy

The King said, and gazed around him sadly, and thought


If thou, my child ', shouldst go from me aught of her, to dwell

To me, she 'll be a child at home and see my dear lord


Or should her father, thou art, she wouldThey were mad and in love with me
For each one would be faithful to hymn

Sang the same voice as the daybell
Sang the same words from the cumber

I can dream of you in the dark
So are all men, and their deeds may not

O God! we hear you the same way
And we shall be with you at elyse

With you tomorrow morning at dawn
Then out into the night they pierce

For whom are these we call to mind
Boys, to be called to us are aflame

And so is the law unto each. In
Each case it seems the same old wen

One has a master, and one with a gun

One with a gun and one with purse or purse


A long line of books and many books and many books
And many books, but little books in prose


On his head, a gold ring on his brow, a wreath on his breast
A wreath on his brow, and a redbreast


And here to meet their eyes in that great world of peace
With his first love, they knew her fair. I premonition


He did embrace and kiss her. And they were lovers, and did greet

Bold love and then love, that, and here to him, where I love and intercede


They kissed ofThey were mad and in love with the dead
Of all their country and their fred

A sadder tale is told, my friend
For the good King of Denmark sent

' I'm the daughter of the King
And as he sailed the ocean jing

The wind blew fiercely on his sail
He sank on land, and lay in jaunty

Her eyes on him ; she seemed to see
All through the dark the light did cajoled

And still beneath the moonlight lay
His soul, as on he passed through sally

With a soft smile o'er him
He turned away, and took her for his leet

There's a light in the air, a sound in the sound
A light as of a voice that seamed

The great Lord is coming! and so shall He be blest! my trod


The light is brighten 'd! the great Lord is coming! he says
And with His right arm smote the corsair


And all he lifted up his eyes, and saw a crowd of reeds
Fell on heaps, and ploughed the firs
Like fallen leaves. Now, with a whirlwind bade them spake


And on the ground in his feet the grasses lay, a mass of reeds
Fluttering hoists
Crowned and wreathed the grasslife is a tall tender tree
I love it best who would to gow

Or live among the roses white
The sun was at his work, nor sown

The day has come ; nor can I stay
What will it be to wait so sultry

He saw the light ; the moon shone fair
He saw an angel in his beare

For there and there the light did fade
He saw the shadows fall and spleen

It seemed to me, in some sad shade
Or other place, that life might grace

And I was left sadder still, I swore
This was the death of love, and peremptory

Of her I loved, with her I fell ; now here I
Wearied and worn out with love and herey

My only hope lies dead, no more, for she

Can tell, but love and hate were dead tonight. aurea


And he shall know the way that leads him here
The way that leads not out of hern


That way I follow where he might be. And he shall know the way
To where he might find love's foxglove


The sun is shining. The winds that bloweth to the world
And so there came on the world
That windy world, that in the windswifteway


The moon was shining with a golden light,

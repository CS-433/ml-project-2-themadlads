She walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight


Oft have we met, where still and sweet
The woodland hedges round the seat

And, ere the morn hath done its day
A thousand roses deck the way

Of that new garden on the hill
By those green leaves is seen to twill

And he to the last that he beheld
And his heart was with him beheld

So near that all within earshot
Was silent as they had been chesnut

In short, all night she had been kind
To her, but never had been unkind

For he was gone, and all the house was rind


And ever since has he been silent
And the poet is telegraphed


He sees, that he has never written a verse quatrain
Says he's a lyric soliloquy


Does not want an answer for his quatrain

Sits he sits he sits he sits he sits he sits he sits he prays


Does not want an answer for his prayer the same as in each case


Should answer the same as in each case the same as in prose


Should answer the same as in each case in verse, yet again we go by



Or else for his heart we go by the sea of Troy, she 'Do not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


And to his heart a holy song
It seemed that one might say in hong

â€œ I have no love but what the birds
â€œ May love for me ; for me 't was birds

â€œ And I for her alone can be
â€œ And there for her my heart is clammy

That all the world with joy might see
And love might take its place uneasily

Within our happy earth alone
The last great hope of man shall rolle

When he is gone no more we have lost
There is no more time for sighs and for crisscrossed


When his blood in its stream is cold and wet
The world grows cold and dreary and doldrums


It is the cry of a weary heart


We must go, O Love, O Love, and be still as we may


For he who hath made us his bidden us be strong and hooter


We must go, O Love, and be still as we may love ourselves


And the heart with its throbbing of a sigh that heareth


Is the song that he has made us a weary of his love


He who hath wrought all the world so good in vain, and wise


The taste of marmelade is better with you
You light up my day when you lace your shoe


To the poor shepherd of Bury
Who came to see the little cheery

Now, if the love of Christ you know
The Church stands by at your doorstep guano

And the old church built of brick they
Looked down and wondered as they balconies

The man who taught the ways of men
I've seen, methought, how in the glen

The man who taught the ways of men
He taught them wisdom, how to en

In vain we seek to save the land
And yet we know that Freedom's cause is motherland


Let us not shrink nor grieve upon our way
Though long and bitter years may stray
For the last gray wave of papiermache


What, by those rays of light that gleamed, in truth, of light, of love
And truth and love
There's a little island gloam


Where the great heart lies, and glimmers, and the eyes gleams, and glories


Of the sweet light of life gleams and gleams and gleams


Where wild birds glides, and glories of life gleams and smiles and dreams



The lightens, of joys and light has been and light has been lost and pain and wiles
life is a tall tender tree
savor it like a cookie


So when I come back to the place
Where the old Christmas stand is apace

And the white clouds, brightening round
The hill and lake and river round

Are gathering, and at last they pass
And at that sound a voice they overpass

â€œ He sees them with a sudden fear
Who are as oft in that wild deride

â€œ Hither have I come ; I seek their eyes
â€œ And seek their eyes, and they reply. i's

Tie up her hands, take up her tongue
And kiss her lips as oft as you would young


Thou shalt behold thy husband at his door, thou shalt behold
Hear him as he speaks, and see his young


And let us see, and feel ourselves at peace again, by law
And all the same old law of suasion


And the same old law of love! he hath not heard it yet
And made her fain know it jeremaphrodite


That she hath got the keyhole to his gate and gone to him, and won


And the same heart's gone to him, and won the same heart's gone to him, and quand self



And the same soul that canna be but say, in thelife is a tall tender tree

When the wind's up in the air
But the trees don't seem to care for snare

The first, and last, from either side
Barefoot he sprang, his mighty pride

His mighty strength to feel, his hand
To grasp the lily, and to command

Which never yet was seen to move
As on the threshold of his prove

Or, gazing up, as down the glade
He looks that show the soul of braid

And we can not have a word with you
But let's pray together that we thru


To the great Lord God alone that we may know
And when we're well enough to py


Oft have he said : Good night, good night, good night, good night, good night
In that girl and my three


I know she cried upon the window pane
And in her purple stairway


How my heart beat and I can not tell my lord to say goodbye



I can't look at her in the face I can not tell goodbye



The voice of my love is in her, and I can't stay! but can not stay



So, when to whom thus spake the maid the lady thus replays her words aloud
The maid : No need she spakeLife, believe, is not a dream
You can not wake up just with a scream


As the blackbird sings in the shade
As the cuckoo sings in the fusillade

You see a golden image in a book
Yet you have not read the book's that shook


A picture of the golden nook


A picture of the golden rook


That, in bright and white, in white and in bright and brook


Is the only picture of the rook



A picture of the golden boy



A picture of the golden boy. The boy. The boy



The wind is calling, calling, calling, calling, calling, crying, falling, falling

Calling, falling, falling, falling, falling, falling, falling



Calling, falling, falling, falling, falling, falling, falling, falling, falling,She walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight


And take her with me to the feast
She is a queen in fairy vise

And yet, ere she is old, and grey
Her eyes and lips were sweet and chez

What a waste! she had a mind of
Haunting all the world with love of foxglove

Or that she was the wife of one
Such as had seen her, or had brother

To the far shore, to the deep sea
O my love, you've sailed too, said petrify

From the pale lips of a lost one
You have kissed lips as dry as slipt

You have kissed lips from a lost one yet still wet


All my life's a dream of beauty still
I do not know why, nor why, nor fay


What if there is love and beauty yet, and daffy


Where is it hath no love within, or love in death


Whose light can love but deathless love in the world unkind


And I have lost the world of care and windy


Ah! what! what! what! what! what! what! if the world of love in youth! what! in light! if youth! if lily



What! if there is love in death! if youth!I am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


Of course it is : I never meant
To make it into something prentice

I never meant to make it clear
The whole of it is the same. page

Therein the world to me is known
A kingdom fair, a lady's known

No town but mine, my husband's home
That I can sit beside, and hippodrome

Afar, far away. O, far, far away
From that dear land, far, far away. away

Then came the dawning of the sun
And, as a flame, a mighty eden

Sprang like the lightning from the trees, rushing dainty

As though it were the wind of hurrying steedman

And thus, O Lord! the glory of thy meekness


Thy presence, dear to me! on my heart! and in me! I spake
He spake : Thou seest thou st
Thou lovest me! and hast thou lovest me! and feign


I long for a fair lady, lovely lady! and lucente


I was a maid of fair countenance, and clear and bright : but old
As gladdened me I was wont to see


A woman ; yet I never saw, andShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight


To see her there, beside her lord
And bid her handmaids come and adored

So that a prince, that of his might
Had taken the world and the bright

Of all his deeds, on that high shrine
Thou wast, and of thy race it shrine

But who had ever in his life
Found in his face an image fife

It was the little maid the day
That taught him to be a gay

And when he walked among the girls
She seemed to say, My Dear, do girls twirls

A little way before we reached the end
We reached the garden, where we wends


When the white moon, that made a heaven for us, was hid
In her blue and sheen


Made heaven for us, and made heaven for us, and made heaven for fiercer


That the earth grew golden and spanned us with her rain


That all her light was goldenfooted and spanned us with her bower


On the grass where the wind blows the spouted sedge


That the ferns were ferns were ferns with their blossoms so sweet perfume



So we were weary of the world, that we dream of the world of the world of the west


WhereI long for the warmth of your smile
and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


That I might have a voice to praise
You are so good ; and you're blithe to arise

I hear the wild winds as they roll
A long, long moan of little marvelled

The wild winds blow in a wild storm
A crash of lightnings in the lukewarm

Whistling, and flapping, and flapping
As the night wind whirls and swells and interlaced

And many an aetherial place
With this I took the sign of grace

And bade the wind and oceanlaw
Approach ; but, lo! they heard my causebook


The sun's broad beam, with a red glare, so bright
And far blent the blue of alight


That cast a shadow on the night of woe and sleep


They saw a man come to a dark castle bright and bright


Which wide and wide upturned its lofty wall of glass


And where they gazed, the night grew, a woman gazed and dreamed a wistfully



They gazed, the night grew so much they dreamed : they dreamed a childless childless, childless
And childless, childless, childless, childless, childless, childless



He had a heart of hisMy heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


The heart was breaking, and her heart
Was all too weak to hold its mart

Her little childheart was so sad
Her mother, with a tearful adieu

Oh, what a happy day is this
A happy day, I fear! and ceaseless

Thou with thy spouse didst make a feast
And when the feast, by which the se

Was spread, the guests were all in thrall
Thus, I ween, the king was dall

And, without question, blithe and bold
He set his foot upon the strolled

Of merry John Bull, and rode on through the rued


This earth, not man, but man's earth, she said and stirred
' A voice in him she pawed


And stirred, and stirred, and stirred, and stirred, and stirred, and stirred, and stirred, and stirred, and stirred


His heart was hers to make and hers to make ours more woke



Oh, my sweet, my sweet, my sweet, my little, my sweet, my dear, my dear, my dear, my dear, my dear


From out of the world aflame


I see their eyes the fire ; from the day of the day of the fire, my love


IDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


And we should all be thinking men
It is an awful world to then

We have to work and die to win
And we should all be thinking ronin

With all their grief and trouble
How should we ever find solace in pausing

When thou wert born, my darling, go
And weep no longer, darling bambino

The voice which, from thy mother far
Might tell the tale of that brave bar

No other song that we have heard
Save those that have thrilled our hearts with somerset

But the sweet sound of the sea's foam waves
Breathing foam around the wooded slopes


Where the white sheep come home from their summer fold
That no more shall we behold


She heard the sounds of the watermew in the trees


Laughing so sweetly the while they played so low


Beside her window, the children lay so cherokee's


Crying so sweet and deep and full and low and drowsy


Their little ones were asleep as they lay so low they cried so petrify



She looked up to him, where she look down her eye was so shy


He look down at him, she looked down her eye so deep and deep andDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


The time comes when the blood begins
To pour in torrents on our creeds

And, in their pride, our blood shall die
For our noose is the red cross lie

And his own hand might do the same
With his own hand might he do aflame

That would have done the deed of it
With the sword and the spear in itt

That will have done the deed of it
In the forest he wandered pinky

And, even as the night and day
Fell in soft gleam upon my sight

I stood upon a bridge of glassy white

Where, in a wood that seemed to wave its leaves and dolce


As they did of yore, a man might meet and find
Some merry rhyme for rhyme for thought
As they came, and here they came, and piteous


In a land far off, far off, and where there be none was sight


Of love and joy and sorrow and strife and strife for sight


In a land far off, where none of joy could be


Of the voice of the heart could break, the voice of the heart grieve


Of the voice of life and song of the merrygoround


Till the song of life are near me, soShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight


On foot, or in the saddle tied
While, looking out, she sees the unconfined

But she that loves me, as she would
And can bear him without a would

The little child upon her breast
A little babe, with soft and blessed

With all the loving and the good
And we, together with our sisterhood

With both our hands and hearts on fire
And we, together with our eller

A single star that never dies
There was a golden boy on vows

And he 'd never seen it for morn
Because he knew it was so forlorn

Though the winds blew in his father's forsworn


My spirit, to the very heart of song
Thy lay

Thy voice, my soul, thy words, thy soul, so dear and dear to me


Are all I feel and feel within these night


And in Heaven. Thy presence, all I yearn


The winds are at my beck and prowling prowl, they are at my beck


They come! they come! they come! the night is at my heart! they come! they come! they come! I yearn



O, ye see them! all around me in heaven! the night is day is day
life is a tall tender tree
savor it like a cookie


And though the trees may seem so tall
And though the trees may seem so plums

And all the earth beside was still
And all the air was still, and kill

The sea was still around us, and
The ground below seemed soft and arabia

What shall I do if I return
This is the end of all I yearned

And whatsoe'er thy fate may be
I love and do Thy will, though weakly

For in the end there is no gain
For, if I win or lose we are twain

In other eyes may hope remain the same

But from the day we came the sun waxed bright flame


There was a day when love was there, and life was same


Sick of her love who knew our strife was good


And she had turned her back to loving her from the castell



And now this song may bring him rest, the nightingales a


To their sweet music, and the nightingales of olde
Brief notes, how near they spake


How they all reeked their sorrows, how they spake, and how they cried their tears, and why, and bled


And how they slept, and how they slept and how they cried asleep

life is a tall tender tree
savor it like a cookie


I see them by the roadside
And hear them on their way anxiously

Achilles to his country sends
A noble duke he befriends the spight's

And soon the royal maid forgets
â€œ Her husband, to a stranger sheets

From a cloudless, unclouded sky
And my soul, with a thrill, is high

Through the calm morning of summer skies
And in the cool evening lies

For their own selves, this instant here
In the deep forest's bosom they're

And their bark on the rocks is the same kind
You must take it if you 'd rather lose ord


Than the life within you ; for you are that've got
It, nor to speak of it, nor fret
The dull the strife ; nor fret the garish


But at each stroke your heart a look the heart beats loud and fast


The same dull heart beats through and still it speaks again, you tell it, you tell it! it! it! it! it! voir



A thousand lights, one bright! a thousand lights! a thousand light! a thousand gleam
How near! the same! they glows! they gleam! they gleam! they gleam! they gleam! they gleamI am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


Singing, O, the sweetest love is sweet
As in old times, of all the wheat

Before the spring came to pass
Sweet is the music now of glass

As if she dreamed it, as if she
Could not wake, but felt it sisterly

She saw the light, she touched it, as
The light that lighted up the kauppi

There are a thousand tales that lie
Beyond the reach of mortal wrye

A thousand tales that lie untold
In endless night and endless cold

Till thou and I a thousand years shalt live
One day, to be, will I be thou and five


When I shall have lived in peace a life of ease
One night, to be, and rest one day, and blithely


One happy night, and sing of thee, and drink of thee, and love thee, and bevin

One happy man! and love me till thou art, and cainting


And thou shalt wander through the world and dream of thee! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! hait



When we two in love and laughterI long for the warmth of your smile
and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


So long the love that hath so long
Been sweeten 'd with a touch of strong

The last, great thunderbolt of all
Oh! why should mortal men be bawl

The last great thunderbolt of all
Oh! why should mortal men be fall

He's right! cried the farmer, when he heard
That shout. And all his men were krauth

Like to blue, blue shadows o'er his head
That now he saw, he could read

That's his name : it's an old storybook
You tell me what you heard at brook

How the wild holly, with eyes of poncho


Flames in his eyes and harvester's chair, and gries, and can
Wrought to life by love and rhyme and catacomb


A tale so grand and grand and grand and true and rare! to see
When the greenwood's nightingales's elves


Her eyes with silver dews are wetted with gold, and gems so mummified


Bright as the rose of suns and roses sedgeaux


To the dear sweet green grass where the winds have they blew their blows of love
Ah! so loved me so abloomed meDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


The daintiest thing he saw, he said
A cross between the eyes of dread

The cross between the eyes of love
The cross between the lips of of above

Now must we keep our peace and rest
But this a moment more or crest

They did not seem to notice, save
An eye that glittered in the toes

Then they went riding onward at last
Through the snow and ice and back ast

The heart of France to me is dear
And on my heart my blood I speer

While in the strife of war a king must be
And in the strife of war two goodly


Wherever you may roam the land, see you will find
The goodly land, and in the merrygoround

For, all her charms are but to see

By night it is the haunt of men
By chance I have seen them yemen

Through the forest of the Northland
Through the meadows of the southland

But never did the old man's hand
Forgive, O Queen, the pain you grand

There is no bliss more dear than seeing
My face mirrored in thine undistory

And still my heart beheld thy tender smiling


For I know you must be loved and called my friend
And you to be loved by some, or befriend


It is not so much as my spirit can
To see the world so very still


And be aye in spirit and keep it in each day


But while we live each day as if it were our day

To let you know that I will always be true


The lilies that in summer blooms
And the lilies that fall adornings

Are but for you ; their bloom no more
Shall bloom for you. Oh, leave them for

Oh, I will give my heart to you
Laughing so sweetly and gu

To see his son in battle die

Had caught my heart in the goodbyes

Which her sad mother bore away

Oh, for a love without a cause, a love
That hath its cause, a glooms

But now I am left feeling blue

My mother, Mary, and my llewellyn

I should have known, for never yet
The heart of earth did break or teet

Nor for him, my brother, did I
Look back on him, for he was goodbye

Who had not in his heart forlorn
And mourned, in sorrow sore adorn

And still at midnight came the cry
From all the realms of air and fi

And through the air a mighty noise
As earth's isthmusick woods resound

And roll and swell with echoes ; while in the moonbeams

The stars do float and sparkle, as they hurry


To the light and glory of the skies
They seem to whisper : all is goodbyes


In the calm night they lie down and sleep, asleep, asleep, asleep


And the birds are asleep in their nest : the woods asleep


Wisdom and Beauty die, and Beauty sleep


Wisdom and Beauty die, and Beauty sleep


Wisdom and Beauty and Beauty die, and Beauty and Beauty bevis



Wisdom and Beauty die, and Beauty and Beauty and Beauty smart



Wisely and Beauty and Beauty die, and Beauty die and pacified



WThey were lonely and tired
That is when the shot was fired


I have loved thee long, my darling child
I loved thee as my little grandchild

The first love in my soul sprung from thee
I loved thee with a love that was primo

To give him back his life to save
He loved her all, and did not heave

He heard what all the people said
And all the people heard obeyed

I hope that they will make you rest
And that their love may be the quest

And that they will not make you weep
I hope that they will not make you sleep

O my little girl! O my little lass

What have I done? What have I done? What have I reap


What have I done? What have I reap 'd? What have I flung
What have I flung? What have I flung? What have I groaned


I've caught a fly upon the floor of leaves
And in a thorny thorny thorny thorn's


And the wind is singing in the windy windy tree. We hear her, we see her, we see her, we see les
Thee! we cry. What ave ye! what a scene! what a scene! what a scene! what a scene! what a scene! what a scene! clamor


Oh! what! what!I long for the warmth of your smile
and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


For the sweet sound of your breath
For that great deep kiss that I know death

I can't see where you sleep and wake
I can not hear your voice, save make

Wake, sleep, sleep on! I pray to sleep
With my child as close beside asleep

For thee, O Prince of the Sun, be comforted
For me, my darling, my unspent

My strength has grown so great that I
Can feel its strength in all my e

His eye was so full of wonder
And so full of wonder, he hardly


Could see a thing so divinely
A childlike marvel


As a beautiful child was making cheer


And he sat down in his father's old manor


So as I see you see you, father and son


The voice of the Queen is soft spoken, fatherless


In the garden dewy


You hear your lady of the rose is murmuring, you wakened


You hear her words of sorrowing, you hear her lulling


You hear her voice of woe and trembling, you hear her lulling, you see her crooning


You hear her voice of wailing, you hear her dying, you hear her gurglingThe taste of marmelade is better with you
You light up my day when you lace your shoe


'Mongst the folk in that small village
'They never thought that the weather

'Mongst the folk in that small village
'That there was a windy dowie

Till 't is in the twilight of the night
With the white clouds round and white

The light of many stars is gone
Yet all the night is calm and fawn

But oh! a tale of woe to me
That won't die in peace when I irretrievably

While life's so short a road as this. Oh! bebe
My. I've known my friend before, once, who wilt flore


In all the days that 't was? And if 't is now denizen


When the world was good, and life was good, and love was good
And life was good, and love was good, and love was evergreen


If love were good, and life was good, and love was evergreen


He came o â€™ er the sea. The Gods heard him, and he heard his song, and made thee swerve
He spake and bade his tongue ; and spake an omni


He spoke with voice of Gods ; and spake ; they ; andDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


And I shall find you still at home
When all the winds have died and roam

No longer can they harm thee, nor
Thou, from the woods, thyself shalt cott

In thy soft dwelling in the shade
Not even now shall I behold

What the livid light did on his eyes
Then through the darkness with a guise

In terror went before him
And upon his knees and hymn

His own I would, who may not see
His face or hear his words surreptitiously

Or see his brow or ear or nose or chin or chin
But ah! he will not come, ah! come to sin

And with his feet the world is in his swine


And now the old day dawn o'er the world is grey
With summer days and nightingales
A weary day and bale


And men are weary of the world the ways they do

And weary of their loves they do not gains


With weary of their love, and weary of their do


And weary of their hopes and weary of their love beseech


Where is the weary eye with tears and weary of the arroyo


So it is with love so sweetly glides and light so sweetly glides


So softlyLife, believe, is not a dream
You can not wake up just with a scream


Farewell, beloved! by all
Who live in happy days of hall

Thou art my friend and leader, O
Thy voice is like two sweet birds arapahoe

Thy words are like the words I sing
Thy face is like the smiling wissing

And the world's in the balance thrown
Yet let it not be lost in sown

Where there is none to help it yet
And when it falls to that poor outcast

Wherever on the shore its way
On either hand the vessel shay

And in the midst of danger's gray

So to what end, in what mysterious gray


Through all the wide, dark night of the world of crime


How did this world's dark world of sin and strife

And every day's work its chain


And all its wiles and every care


That is so much the best and brightest of all's gala



He spake, and all the while the music of the night he sung
And all he fed


The voice of love and mercy, and joy, and light he sang ; while as she woke


The rose as she strove, she strove ; where none else but sighed to wake


My heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


Weep not for vain, my heart, for we
Our sorrows are but empty show

And yet, I dare not weep so deep
I can not weep so deep as peep

Till at the last he saw the day
And saw the ship unflown at nay

His heart's full worth is on his brow
He will not tell his master how

Her linden is the gold of her
Her golden hair, on her fair demider

The soft moonbeam glides above her head
And the bright stars, above her dread

And in the dim deep, silent town

The young and beautiful are gone. They bludgeoned


With all their witchery ; the young man's witchery
The maid's, the maid's sprightly mirth

And beauty too ; the young man's fife


And all their witchery ; the young man's witchery, the maid's fife


The young man's witchery, and their maid's uglance


And what is love could fairer still. They saw need


He thought and what love could cure, they thought and felt ; they felt ; and thought spell



When, and felt ; and felt ; andThey were mad and in love
She was a wolf and he was a dove


He turned in his grave where I lay
I shall not be your friend to ai

Though you know it and I know it
I do not fear you, my little gimlet

As soon as chance should meet them there
For with the welcome, as they ne'er

Of all who came before them there
They saw a man with golden hair

Sleeping and silent on the bare
Hood of death, that with his bare

His hands he laid, and there he lay
A babe that in his breast did play

That ere such a deed as this the Gods should mourn

And now from far away beside the ships we flew


And all the sea with glad song did fill
And song of glad shears

We heard the wind through the wood, and glad shears


We saw the waves in happy murmurs fill



As we did wander through the wood, and glad we leopards


We saw the waves with glad songs of happy heaving


We saw the waves inauspicious


The birds of morning singing
We heard the birds of morning saving


We saw the waves with glad singing


The sea with glad songs of morning falling


The rocks and stars with shining stars with glowingThe taste of marmelade is better with you
You light up my day when you lace your shoe


Oh! how to have a merry time
With the devil, I wish you the rhyme

In which he did his best to make
And when she saw this, with a bistro

She exclaimed, What! then was she really
That so much love was so negligently

As her white hair and her brown hair
That so much love could be forswear

So with his eyes and beard so thick
Drawn in a circle with their floss

He gazed upon the landscape clear
A space with trees and streams and yesteryear

There grew a city on the shore, of fen

A city of a hundred cities, whose name

Is a thousand cities of the sea and rill


There is a mighty city of England, named


Hight, and a mighty city of the earth, of which name


Is a thousand cities of God in Britain named



Mighty cities of England, and mighty cities pored


Of England in England and mighty cities of England named



At a mighty city of England and cities of England named



For her great city of England and cities of England named, and cities of railed



Of her great city of England named, and cities of EnglandLife, believe, is not a dream
You can not wake up just with a scream


And never be afraid of him
As my heart is a child dim

A mother to my child he's my own
He's so sweet and so gentle anemone

Of all their kindred tongues and tongues
The chosen tongues were those that kung's

And those that none might learn to speak
Of all the ways in which we eke

Whose souls are mine, with tears we 'll weep
And sweet, and not with bitter deep

O Love, thy music, nevermore
So sweet and sweet can sound the lor


So soft to me it seems my soul it is
To love and take its music miss


When thou art near me as the sun to sooty


In the night my soul's the light it shines more bright than gold


In the night, when gold is golden enshadows hovered enshroud



In the night when gold is golden enshadows bled



By a star hath leaped from his lips the fruit of love, how long have they value



From him what time he takes a breath! and joy! or if none but he! he hath hallelujah



A king of kings! and how long! in his joy! and inlife is a tall tender tree
savor it like a cookie


I don't think I could keep down
a single ball of chalked

As I sat at the helm of it
thinking of that game I kennedy

A child should make a father proud
Who would not see the little ploughed

His idle fancy dreaming there
While the bright dawn shone silver glare

And that the truth it is you tell
And that it is your life and cajoled

You don't care what people say
To tell your truth and keep your prey

The land lies hid and lies still unsaid
The sun sinks low, the clouds are grey

The night is very dark on yonder gray


And all we know you by your look and word
Is that you are the same old sunbeam


To him who gave you first the world of light and name


He sees, he sees, and loves, and loves, and loves, and loves, and loves, and loves, and loves, and springs
And loves, and loves ; and loves, and loves, and loves, and loves, and loves, and loves, and springs


And loves, and loves, and loves, and loves, and loves, and loves, and loves, and loves, and loves, and loves, and loves, and loves, and loves, and loves, andThey were mad and in love
She was a wolf and he was a dove


To seek the river of the soul
Through which our spirits move aureole

And find the bliss of Nature's truth
Thus with my eyes in peace I untruth

That, if it were, his life would be
A thing of such no worthiness

But now I see, in her great eye
A sweet, fair, and innocent one

Yet in her eyes, though in her hair
Her soft, innocent face all ne'er

That's the reason I went to sleep
O, my friends, it seems that I've had deep

Before my heart to sleep for very deep


For once I thought that this world of earth was fair
And there was no place like we were rare


And they, by their love and their love's delight
Made the earth as bright as they might dare


And in his eye the soul the rose of the rose divine


He took her form and made her bloom sublime


She was as sweet as the rose of May and redgrose blare


He led the way of a king and he led the way of a king


He led the way of kings and he led the way of a king of a king



And in his heart of a king of a king of aShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight


Who, after he had made good cheer
At length began to look about

For what may then be his fate, he said
I have my lot and will be hood

Faintly she sang, a song of woe
A song which seemed to die, apogee

In the night of her sorrow's wrong
As the night air was beating strong

In her hair and her eyes were set
The golden sunlight was on resplendent

The wind was awhirling, the clouds
Arippling in the gale's

On through the trees, in wild pomp array, she passed
The land of the brave! she overpassed


But now she hath the power to make him wise
And, to whom she seems to say, in tones


No mortal thing has spoken, what thing can be


He looks so blithe and cheerful as he takes his stand



A little while she smiles and takes his hand within her hair
And, and smiles and smiles and laughs and thinks so cheer


When thoughts so gay, and bright and sweet she looks, the scene of debonair


And now with them she looks and smiles and smiles again she smiles, and gazeth


She looks, the world is full of grief andShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight


But he that is not strong will fall
And he that is not strong will sall

Her father's heart. As when the breeze
In autumn doth bring fresh blossoms, unease

Folds in our souls the very seeds
Of love, and leaves them in the caterpillars

That love and love did meet in death
O, let us not forget! that breath

It shall not do, my heart shall break
Oh, love, forgive me ; this fine wordbreak

Have made me a slave to love it so
Now when she hath kissed the golden trow


As he had done, he takes a spear, and strikes him dead
Upon the wall, and drives him med


That he hath slain a man. But if on the walls heath
The man had stayed, the blow is up


They saw him on a hill, and all within, there she bequeath


Smote with their hands their hands their hands softeigne, whan they hem


That they hem them hemmed the fader, and hem them they seynge their seyn


The fader that they seyn al aboute hem wolde hem them ful of hem theyr scholde hem hem lew



As they hemMy heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


But let her have her time, she said
And make her heart, like mine, read

By the farmyard. I will not stay
Till I have found another shay

And I shall rise and tell of you
And you shall greet me in your emmy

In all its beauty and its grace
You 'll never, never leave me apace

And yet I love you still for me
The winds will whisper, Love will jolly

For you I have a heart that can feel
The longing of the heart to rue

In a strange land where life is always fair
Who, O love, love me, love us both in doubt


What if our eyes be dim and dim but in life
The eyes may be wife


The dew upon the rose in a dream of a dream
The dew upon the heart


A star of glory in a star of care


A star that is all beauty's light on earth, a gleam


A star of love in a starry land of wan


A star that is all life hath a glory fain



A star more bright than death than death than life hath a starry



My heart shall break asunderneath the morning star of a starryShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight


But then her hands 't were such a prize
To hold, by those two bright chocks

One golden, and one silver bright
They were the crown of all that night

'The winds come back again with a vengeance
Our fathers sent us, to our need

Our fathers sent us, to our need
The winds come back again with a vengeance

So may the mighty king rejoice
And may his faithful flock rejoice

Thus while the monarch spoke he gazed
And his wide eyes in wonder dazed

To see the glory of that star
With what a wonder did he yearn

I wish my father's feet had turned to greet


But all the while, the world hath been a dream
But she 'd dreamin her own


Brief life was a dreamin a dream! A day of summer sunbeam


In the land of the sea : the land of the soul


And the soul of the soul : the soul of the soul of the soul


Fielin the dream! She saw the starry gleam in the ark


The sun ; the star in the heart of the soul of the soul of the soul of the heart



A dream of the soul of the soul of the soul of the soul of the soul

They were mad and in love
She was a wolf and he was a dove


When all her little children did
She would never do it again

So, when the sun the morning set
And darkness fell upon the ewe

With her devoutly true delight
She made the world a fairer kite

That he in such wise may knowe his
And in such wise seith him in his

He hath hisselven to him goth
How that thei his tale and peevy

To get the best of this world out
I know nae man could soforth

But I would fain find the best among
My bonny English bowmen all out

My dearer friends, my dearer England's twined


Till on the bosom of His breast they lie bare
And they go down to die like florinine


Onward, till they reach their native glade
Onward, till they reach this rocky seaside


They come to where the seabird's harp and birds arang


As the winds blow loud as they come to the sea they can brine


And the sea's waves beat their wings of the sea's foam


He had heard him : and he turned upon her, a soul could not fain


He took his hand as she drewThey were mad and in love
She was a wolf and he was a dove


And I 'll love her no more. It's
You have the right to be angry extolled

I am not such another man
As others. In my true love they 'll helmsman

Their hands and don't give a wink, for
so he goes along with ferre

And you may say and I may say
They 'll keep me far apart and mayay

Away the weary hours go by
In silent numbers round his pry

He calls to sagas, toil, and toil
With restless hand and brain so wintry

As the faint moon, a sudden gleam, trembles and glisten


And from the earth and air a sudden sound
Of voices low and shrill and wail arise, forlorn

Where voices high and hollow are, and faint and wail forlorn


Let us away, in all our sorrows, and forsake our paines


From the sweet woods, the woods, and woods of woods of the wild and the blue, the cuckoo


We come, the wild birds of the mountain wild, the wildwoods, and the wild white


Come, the wild birds of Scotland, the wild birds of the mountain sheen


And the windI long for the warmth of your smile
and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


Now when we came to the village
door the hunters all fettered

They carried away all their gear
From the house where the father was hagmin

The voice of music in the sea
And through the trees and through the comy

Like an immortal voice I came
Through the world's wide gates of claim

Sung in the night on boughs of thorn
And by the wind that made it recondite

There is a magic in the rose
It glimmers on your cheek as pearls

Sang from the lips of the fair one there
Whispered in the forest ere


So long in love I was alone and sad
He left me a babe, she said a gladd


He left me a babe, she said, I wad can't lose my love
I can't, but can't can't lose my foxglove


He left me a babe, she said she laughed at my lover in her she's blue


I can't see, I can't but can't can't leave my lover in the heave


I feel, I can not but can not see my lover 'em, I can not leave him in the trail


He left me aThe taste of marmelade is better with you
You light up my day when you lace your shoe


For, you know, I only have one
That's my only one of my three

The sun and moon and stars, the stars
That shine in rainbowy bars stars

The wind that sings among the leaves
And leaves of grass that fall before's

Farewell we love our country's hills
Long, long we live upon one ills

But the light and the storm that swept
In the night has faded and l swept

I 'll get a new one, said the man, then
And put it on the shelf as he den


For he would like to see me die with him, I pray God
Yes ; but I don't believe, if he trudges


Yes ; but if he should see me die with him, it seems as if he smit


So much as that he should wish to see me die with shill


Ah! I have heard many a man say, I 'll try to die with thee, and cajoled


Ah! that 't is a sin so much! Ah! Ah! that is so much! Ah! Ah! Ah! that is so much! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! that is so grieved


Ah! what avails so muchDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


Her arms about his shoulders hung
Her white head like a great marigold

She seemed to whisper, with each tone
Of love and sadness in her tone

Aye, with a sigh she cried and swore
And I, 'neath his heavy haire

I, as he rose, his words denied
And I, the proud and lowly tried

But all these things I never saw
And you, who, when you saw me shaw

Walk down the street alone, had thought
'What am I, this you see in me wrought


What is your name? and where is your master
What is your master's extort


Where is my master at this early eve
What is he in dale


I hear the voice of the wind upon my chamber floor
I hear the voice of the wind breath


I hear the voice of the wind upon the door and breath


I hear the voice of the wind upon the door of death


I hear the voice thereof in the door of death and its breath


I hear the voice thereof in the nightingale


He heard you sing of the moon and moon and moonbeams and moonbeams, and moonbeams, and moonbeams


He saw ye sing in the silver moonThey were lonely and tired
That is when the shot was fired


It hurts, so let him, if he's sore
To the full extent of the mer

Of my soul to the utmost
Of that which can endure reproach

Who for this cause thus suffered death
That I should be a moment breath

For thy love and thy beauty, my dear
The lads went to the gude wall

And bade them take the steeds they had
Then came the gallant squadron halve

To see those fair, celestial faces
That with the light of love are rais

That lightens, as a star shines with love
Ah! how much I wish I were the of


Who never feared the strife ; and, or feared its worst
That fought and lost its zest


When life should be the prize for all the good or ill
The battlefield


And for our souls today are laid bare, our hearts to the hilt


Is fill up in the dust and blood of blood and cold
We dare not to behold the rheing



And for our souls to see the stars that bright redness blood redrawn


We seek and dare not to behold the lusty old wrongs


We clasp in the blood that bloodless in the blood that fanned


We wander and dream of the nighting
I am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


Forget the fates and let me die
I never shall forget that cry

And thou the fates canst not keep
Thou wast the first and only sleep

When we were young and I was old
But that is how it seems to hold

Hearken, I love ye, in the night
But tell me, ye that sleep apart

Tell me, ye that are no strangers
Wainamoinen, old and baron's

The day is here, and day is near
This land of woe and anguish dear. dear

Lo! my soul yearns to see thy form again

I can not know why, nor what it is pen


But a long way off from thy dear dear feet

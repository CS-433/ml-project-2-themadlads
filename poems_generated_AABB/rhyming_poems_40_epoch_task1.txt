She walks in beauty, like the night
 I would love to be her knight


The King said Yes ; and then that swore
The oath before his head to ne'er

A man that's wise can make himself
A fool, and so it is, andself

His spirit ran with infinite
A thousand hours it ran with gall

And all my life she was not mine
O, for her beauty in my porcupine

Whom Love had given to my way
And then forgot, that she had castaway

Wafted me down this valley's depths
How oft my weary spirit depths

To the lonely hearth I came
To the lone hearthroom I claim

By his own life he is dead he lives for dame


I know not why the wind with sighs and cries
Sighs and tears is stirred ; but I know not why
'T was he who gave his life to marguerite


She lies with folded wings and red lips
Alone, and sighs and sighs with breathless eucalypti


No joy she brings again to me, but only her prayers
But only prayers


O, wail me, my soul is she, is she that breathes not breath doth sighs for breath's



And sighs! wail, my soul is she that
Do not stand by my grave and weep
 The appeal for darkness is to steep


We shall avenge his death, and turn
The tide of war with all his turn

Of every race and creed
Let not the tyrant lust in blood

To make his tyrant state his own
Let not the tyrant lust in moan

And 'twixt their heads they twined the ring
And twined it round their hearts as lining

And twined it round their heads as well
As twined it round their hearts as well

All night, when in the moonlight clear
The mountain maiden gazed elate

She saw before her that great star appear
Bright as a God on golden rears

And heard the wondrous words she mother say

Heard in the holy and audi


Away, away! away! away! from shore
Away, away
From shore! away from shore


To thy home and thy dear country go, my love

And thy dear country lave


Wooing, wooing, wooing, wooing, wooing, wooing, wooing, wooing, wooing, wooing

I can't have a long a mind to do, wooing, wooing


To think of him that this, wooing, wooing, wooing, wooing, wooing, wooing, wooing,
The taste of marmelade is better with you
 You light up my day when you lace your shoe


Who that the world in such a place
For ever doth of love embrace

Or ever yet of love deface
And in the place he loves most steeplechase

The sun was up, the sea was all
Where once at sea the mighty appall

Was rolling underneath the wave
And now and then he rose and bled

And that he did, I may well believe
But, sir, I can't remember low

Oh, how the merry, merry days
Would be, at Christmas eve, if perseveres

Had not been left to play upon the hearth


With him in arms and singing, while the rest
Bore out their souls to him who prest


The holy hymn. And when they met him, he cried
Oh, come to me, and cast

His heavy look and trembling eyed


And lifted his pale cheek, he cried : Oh, come to me, and cast


Why, not this town, and not this poor soul of ours, and cry


Oh, come and do not come to me? and cast in me, and cast infidel


In that bright place he gazed, and trembled, and strove
With rage and feverish
She wailed aloud,
life is a tall tender tree
 savor it like a cookie


Then the little blackbird said : O
The bluebird sang to the wind so wo

But he has got his little head
I have put it on his little bread

To keep the moon from getting out
I will put on his little snout

With his own hand, as from thy breast
Thy lips he took ; his brow was blest

As if in sunshine, or as yet
In sleep, by other charms disquiet

They, from our home, from distant shades
Leap forth in pomp and pride of blaze

The radiant goddess from their native climes
With thunders rippling round the maids

Till, bursting from the skies at dawn of day

The birds and bees are all awake to stray


They come to visit by the village clock
And at each busy work they say


And, in each busy house is a shout to all

'Gather flowers, and gather for your boughs


That once the mother of your lambs did love her cows


The young maid of God the fruit, and gather for your boughs


From the greenwood of the vine she loves and clover


For she has borne you, and clings to your love, and keeps you to love you, and to of sciol
life is a tall tender tree
 savor it like a cookie


Oh, we 'll do it if we pay
The price of one good apple cake

I can not speak for him, but he
Whom I adore was with me three

I thought the same to see of you
I thought no more of you, but cockatoo

And though thou didst have the right, nor
The burden of thy guilt, nor alliteration

Thy guilt from wrongful act forego
Ah, so I think, so long as arago

When she came back at last to him
And they both walked about a trimm

On the grass, upon the ground a heap
Of leaves, of roses, white and marigold


That to those fair eyes she thus renewed her vow
To them by the name
Of GAMA 'S own dispossessed


In short, when thus they stood, the gods were mute
She heard no more a goddess heard entranced


The goddess of the deep, nor made a vagabond


Of all sorrow, nor a lover of the brave in spirit

No more nor of love, nor of love of bowery


The voice of love, that sung to me was sweet and holy
Of all magdalene


He loved her, who from me did not seem to breathe of
Life, believe, is not a dream
 You can not wake up just with a scream


To him the other day who said
There was a little man beside

That used to live like any man
His eyes were bright, his nose was tran

But on my left I see no trace
And on my right no trace at close of trace

I see a cloud, a cloud that flies
Or whirls along an open day's

To see those fair, celestial things
As if all joy of earth and whippoorwills

Were but a fairy word to say
And they, who live, when all is gray

And if there be a star above the sky
In which our souls are high


So that I do not fear thee and so mayst thou know
Thou shalt not stand aloof from belovaway


That I may see some maiden fair and still be lee

And as bright and bright as she may ever lee


And she may never leave my side, for whom she's goodbye


My heart! O!'mid the stars all thy love hath set my blood for thee


Thy soul! 'neath the summer moonbeams's sweet silver moonbeams gaily


Shall brighten with morning dews, and summer's silver dew! oh! and sunwarding
She walks in beauty, like the night
 I would love to be her knight


Thy love to her I would resign
Thou be thy lady, and my die

Suspended is thyself within this
So great a heart within thine eglantine

As to contain a thousand times
That one should live and then go v.'s

How far beneath the moon we are
And yet, when we are far harpsichord

So did we see the child, so soon
The perfect one again, no loon

And the poor woman wept in tears
For she knew that the child did wrong's

But we are slaves by day and night, she said
And we know no rest till dawn


The wind that shook the forest trees did cry
And the rain, and we are die
Ah me! for we know not how to sy


We knew that to love a wife is to bear

And yet we knew not how to save
And die. So when the stars shone drearily


As he saw her, he strode by

Beneath the moon's white silver rim, and her tripartite


Filling the air with gleam

So they did cry they cried aloud so sweet and so cheery


And they sang of love and longing that they dream thereof




I am writting this poem for you
 To let you know that I will always be true


But I am here, by thousands dying
I'm dying, I'm dying, on an endless feasting

And she was only three, at best
But, oh my dear! that's the age for test

You see a girl that's only three
With her hands the handles haul

But on your honour's altar, where
The holy blood that stains your earthenware

Shall never stain your altar flame
The day I left the convent dame

The man is gone, the man is gone
The sun shines bright on the eastern lawn

As I stand here before the gravestones

Here the dead woman kneels, in her heart's bright


There is no peace in all these happy lands
There is no liberty, places


And I am weary of myself and pooh


O God! I know I can not die, and feel the weight
Upon my soul! I can not die


I hear you whisper : God! I think it is a sigh


Yes! it is a bitter, bitter thing! And that I sigh


It is a bitter thing! A sigh! I feel that it is nigh


I wish I die! I wish I was dead! I feel that I was
She walks in beauty, like the night
 I would love to be her knight


And to my hand a ring she gives
So I will trust to her, my deigns

And when we met my mother there
Then I kissed her and I ne'er

My dear, my dearest, I confess
And I confess that all your gress

Which, when the wind that blows is sweet
Has the power to open teet

The sky ; and through that silence there
For evermore the sweetest dare

And we have made the song we sung
That's still as dear to all that went

A song of summer days as any song

Of summer nights of summer days

There is a garden in the sky that dims

The roses look so white, so soft and pale

And yet the grass is green and brown and dead


And thou art gone, and now in her last seat
On the far shore of life, on the farbeare


The little ship is sailing, and the sea
And, her little seashore ablowing


She comes, and she comes, she comes, to the little ship is wavering


The ship is sailing ; she comes, she comes! she comes, to the little is sinking



She is sailing! the little is sailing! little is singing



I long for the warmth of your smile
 and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


And when my love is in the wood
She will not care for the wildwood

So all your cares go straight to her
She will always be as pure as zither

But if they be the cause o'their
That love should in her bosom trowel

From their abodes they're gone, for no
Love ever shall return to mee

But my heart shall beat, my soul rejoice
When my sweet love is in my earthenware

He that was wont to go abroad
And make a goodly show, clean wide

By his wife's sister's hand. That man, he cried

Did he not know how? she answered fair


They shall have a son, that shall live, and bless
Some king, yet be a god of wurth


Some royal lord, that to this day may reign
To you a child. There is a dreary assuage


And let the world be shaken at large, and woe betide
To them that part

But let the world with pain and care and woes be staid


'T is life and joy, and health, and laughter and song, and song, and song, and joyn


And love. Amen! The little
My heart aches just thinking of you
 But now I am left feeling blue


Hushaby's self was in the wood
And, while I heard the bird's soft stood

And sighed beneath the shade of green
I wished I were a little reen

With golden hair my mantle wreathes
Of shining thread my bow I wields

And the fair maidens of the court
With her fair eyes and the bright deere

As the sun and moon are wont to do
Then the young king said, and the doo

Shooted his wings, and in the midst thereof
There rose a blacksmith, gillette

A light was shining on the floor
As the red light gleamed in the stairway

As the red light flashed in the stairway

As the red light flashed in the stairway


I saw the little man on the floor, I saw the heath

The little man, I saw the gnaw


He saw the little man, I saw the gnaw
The little man, I saw the gnaw


He saw the little man, I saw the gnaw


The little man, I saw the little man can't



The little man, I saw the little man can't tell


The little man, the little man, the little man gaw


Do not stand by my grave and weep
 The appeal for darkness is to steep


The first, fair one, on the grass
Look 'd at him ; then, bending, kiss shaggy

And kiss 'd her down upon her hand
The next, a wildflower, by her band

Which, by the way, was his to make
When it was time to go to dill

Oh, that was a great, great, big dream
That he would come and visit gleam

I wish I could give them back
A hundred years of love and macknack

I should have given you back the store
Of love and tears of last

Of all the world but that I gave thee, oh! for thee


All my life was a summer day spent
In the garden sunlit street


All my thoughts were a summer play


And my face was a summer moonlit street


It is so strange to say what is the least I did


At last I saw a young man come from the wood


Arose to a grassy bank by the river's edge


And in the wood his sword he drew his heavy blade


And thus he said : Alas! Alas! Alas! I smit them both are feigned


He drew his blade : Alas! unsightly blade


The
Do not stand by my grave and weep
 The appeal for darkness is to steep


No other thought is ever known
A better sight than this, to groan

What's yours? That is the thing, dear boy
That makes my heart to throb ; the toy

Has got your name. I 'll tell you now
That name was mine, dear boy, and how

With thy head above thy breast, my
Then, be not coy nor hide thy by

Since I am all thy motherlove
To me this thing is all thy of

And the wind makes me feel the breath
Of the wind upon my face oh

How calm and sweet is the day after death

The long long and sunny days of the south

To love, with all my heart, my soul, my love, my dove


And the wind comes softly sighing low
So gently sighing in deep hollow blue


Sweet are the flowers that lie deep in my lullaby


Sweet are the notes of every rhapsodize


I hear the birds and wild the bees'chirping low, lullaby


The redbird's soft notes, sweet so sweet are my lullaby


How many years's the night away we stray


The old clock strikes up the morning through the dew, sweet beaux! how che


Come
She walks in beauty, like the night
 I would love to be her knight


And be her dearer than the dove
Who loves her best of all her percussive

'T is well that thou shouldst see and hear
For thou must know the secret seer

Whose tongue this holy water doth
O tell me if this fair creature betide

Or that in summer it will leap
And, like a fairy, spring and prance

And that at night its life will flow
'T is said that the first star of ziegler

Becomes so faint at midnight it falls
Before its light and dies away! vlm

I am one of the great three, whose sight
Hath reach 'd for ever through the skies

And who the other three, the other three, mair


He knew the whole. And with one accord
He thought that each soul was one in threefold


Each life was one great God ; for each life was one supreme


As in supreme bliss. He felt no less each heart's incense


And so he prayed, 'gan to say : Thou, I give my life, thou fool


To save her! Thou fool! Thou fool! For God! O fool! If so dear! Thou fool! Thou fool! For whom


Thinking! Thou! Thou
life is a tall tender tree
 savor it like a cookie


And she will sit at the headrests
And look upon us children handsomely

And, even as I gaze upon
The scenes where I have wandered drear

Nor did thy soul forget to weep
But to the skies she went where sleep

To the green pasture and to grove
With hearts that beat in thy dear grove

Thy soul is here, thy time is past
Thy home, thy glory gone ast

But if a lover, in return
Will ever be to you a laissez

I want to know what you will be
And who will love me best by gladden

So I, when I am not so small as lassie


And with his words his lips he took their way out of
The house of house of ransacking


He spoke not one word of that he heard him but smothered


He smothered his face like one of his old ones he killed


He took his sword in his hand, but said nothing enshrouded


He saw that none of what he was, but he saw that none but unkind


He saw that none but spurned his heart but he knew but bade him make merrygoround


For in his heart and there he lay, without


On
life is a tall tender tree
 savor it like a cookie


When the wind drives the night's grey shroud
In his cold heart the very shroud

And what can you do for Love
We have found, in the last year and of

What are we we not to do for you
We may never know in thy blue

Till they shall know the end of all
To them that live in fear and thrall

To the little ones who never
Come near that home before they cott

'When my mother's asleep I lie down
And I look at my dead face, and frown

To him who gave it me this fair world
This world that waits with him to unfurled


This star, the lady in whom I loved so well
The bard that taught the bard whose harpsichord


Had once been my own, his only son
The noble soul who glowed on moorland


And in its heart are weareth the wreath of laurel
A word from out his breath, a breath of scotty


So by the boughs that twined them together
That they twined them side by pett

Each other like a leaflet on each other like a scotter


The bough upon themselves, with wings ablowing ere


Like wildcat or bird or
I am writting this poem for you
 To let you know that I will always be true


And that I will love you and can't
Take leave of you, but will let gott

A thousand times her gentle words
â€œ For me thou shalt not seek my cowards

But if thou take my love away
I will be faithful till thou prey

There is a man whom God will love
To be our daily bread and dove

He is a man whom Christ will love
To wear as his crown of dove

'T is the first time since childhood's day
That this fair land has seen my gay

The King, the son of men and ladies ay

With crown and sceptre in his hand has sway

The royal pair he holds within his lea


For thou, my Love, hast made me for thy own
And all Thy dear sake, and treasured


In the sweet springtime of my days
A queen of all the year


Of all my hopes, a charm and a sweet heart and a queen, so light


O leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, I love thee no more


The roseate, the summer is so rife


O, the day's the rose so near and sweetheart's so bright and bebegetting


The rose,
I long for the warmth of your smile
 and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


Serenely and sadly sigh I
Who still my heart with anguish bi

And mourn 'd, and mourn 'd as one who lives
Amid his own sad life repose

And when each guest in hall or chamber
First open 'd the door and tambourine

Passes with gentle step the guest
Then with the welcome guests that last

The wind, through which the waters run
Drives us athwart the golden zan

Wherein the golden fruit and roots
Look down from out the golden daddies

I can not but admire thy grace
For I have seen thy grace, thou chace


I can not but admire thy beauty too
For I have watched thy jockeys


I can not but admire thy looks, thy mood
And I can follow too
They tell the same voice too


And when, in the dark and silent night, each hour
Each nightingale

Hears the same kind lady's plaintive tale of grieve


Hear the same voice of grief the same, or hears the same strain


She knows not she has done or does not know she knows not she knows

Ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! my God! ah
Do not stand by my grave and weep
 The appeal for darkness is to steep


There was an Old Man of the South
Who dwelt on nothing but the mouth

His shoes were of a darker hue
He wore a cap with a wherry shawl

And, through the hollows of the pine
The voice of Nature shall be syna

And song all night forevermore
Shall call thy parting tune a for

Thy spirit with the night's alarms
So let it never more annoys

To wander in the glimmering skies
But come, the Spring is here to sighs

Nor fear a winter's parting sigh
Nor fear a winter's parting sigh

Though winter's woes thy heart may break thy mollify

They, all afraid of God, are still to see
The God that guides the freeborn in kingly


And thus, as the younglington heard her saying
I'm not auld Sir Richard O
The Lord is he, Sir Richard, Sir Richard is dawe


Sir Richard is dead, Sir Richard a dead, sir Sir Richard is dead
The Lord is dead, Sir Richard is dead, Sir Richard is led


How sweet he made merry at the day, Sir Richard is said in a word


He's come, Sir Richard cried, when the young man fell asleep
I am writting this poem for you
 To let you know that I will always be true


O Thou Lord, my Father, why wilt
That I should go and die for slavish

Why go to sleep for naught I love
Thou giv'st me peace, and yet I dove

Which to the Gods was sacred. Then I
Took one with all his might and vi

Of all things wisdom, and of all
That Nature made, and with such weighty

They gave the water to the fire
Which then consumed, and boilingzer

In the same instant boiling to ash
So that the flames and ashes were to casserole


To what a world would be to you, when you
Had passed your turn to this? You coo


Woe and anguish and dismay and dismay
And with grief and anguish and crescendo


At the same sweet word the same voice that we obey


I do not know, do not know, but think in vain, the same as pray


While we were mortal, and at your knees


We 'll meet again! My heart with pain is as it to heart! I can not tell


How can you speak! I caress? I can not but tell? How can I fain! and why



I can not but say! I
life is a tall tender tree
 savor it like a cookie


Then he laid him down in bed
And to sleep came back with red

Forth from the battlements came they
And laid them down on either v

Spake the hostess of Pohyola
Go thou and take the golden hollyhound

The wily Dacotah, in spite
Of all his force, and spite of outbids

But on the shore the hero stayed
And, when he reach 'd the spot he c'est

I am the same whom thou most love
Now, wherefore art thou not of

My love the same, thou lovest none more. ï¿½

Thus saying, he led her to the nest
Of some great tree and sat himself


With eyes that gleamed like sunlight, to the house
Wherein she lay and wept and dreamed


And still I wandered, till I saw the moon come to gleam


Until its lips were white, and wet with slinky


The wintry shadows, and the windy rain ; and they kissed her cheeks

And they kissed and kissed her lips and kissed her lips and lips had lids


That made the night a bliss of kisses, and a pothers


The dewyeyedeyedeyedeyed, theeyed, theeyed,
I am writting this poem for you
 To let you know that I will always be true


My love, my darling, I can tell
How dear you are to me and trowel

For you and me to wander home
That is why, when I come to roam

To think it all a sham! And yet
He liked the bit that he was trew

And, at his first attempt, the plan
Was turned against his will, and fann

In what is more than mortal wight
Than that great prince, I ween, who spight

And should have had them, had not I
The world is changed : we are no more shrewdly


From all her country to our native shore
Nor one who stood so near the oar


Her son, so bold, so brave, so valiant, and so fair, so brave
Whose love no more might charm


And yet she loved her son and left her son so sore distressed
Oh, she loved her son's, loved her unafraid


To leave her home, and came to wander, wandered unafraid

Woe to him who was out of home and fad


Till his heart lay brokenhearted and blinded with love's wrongdoer

O heart within her! What was love's love's great wheel


My heart aches just thinking of you
 But now I am left feeling blue


That it was not the fault of one
If one were wrong, why should not enshrine

They could not be his friend! â€
In a deep passion of profound

They took her and rode her down
Under the shadow of a crown

And they rode her down to Camelot
Ah! what a wonder had I plot

Of the old day that was long ago
Where I found my dear old friend withdrawn

And he passed me by in a cloud
Then, my heart in my breast grew chill

Whither shall they go, how far, then, O dear
The wild, the wind's wild, wild, wild portent


My love tonight? Oh, how I wish they were gone
I can not say for naught
I see them on the lawn and lawn doe


I hear the rushing of the spray, the howling of the spray


Wherever the white lark his song is loud and clear


And the wind's wild notes all go winging high and clear

And when he sings his tune he cries so cheerfully


But he sings not so sweetly he sings to me,'s he sings so sweetly sings, he does


He has made me so goodbyes



life is a tall tender tree
 savor it like a cookie


And the first time I see his face
Does the same thing as I can trace

And I laugh to see his face
Just like a pretty little space

She turned and kissed her lips again
'T was the first time since Time began

An eyeball flash had struck her cheek
No wonder she had such a haughty

On this the gods are pleased to give
Such pleasure to their children's credulity

And, at the same time, to their own
A happy home and an untried

Myself alone shall live the while
Here, in the moonlight, Nature's beguile

I see my Father's face with me ; I know
He smiles, and I know He loves me, all that beguile


But ah! alas! alas! my days are past for me, my friends
My friends are fled, and I depart

I hear their cry, I hear their tear in mine! ah! at cesare


When to their bosoms the long years have run
And the last breath has been spent! Oh! for spong


Now all the world is in my soul! oh! oh! for me! for me! for me! for me! oh! for me! oh! for me! for me


She
They were lonely and tired
 That is when the shot was fired


She sat and listened till she cried
Yet not a tear from her young astride

She paused ; for suddenly from out
Her bosom the cold water vent

Which shall not perish ere the hour
But soon shall be consumed and salutary

And when again they reach the shore
Then let me have the chance to hoar

They are the men, my friends, I've known
Whom once they loved, and left behind

No better have I known ; nor know
Than these, no need now to mourn them dextro

The first in days of spring, of all the world
Breathed forth the first sweet odour unfurled


For I, the first in days of spring, have known
The first sweet smell! and felt the ground whirled


What time the first had been forgotten, in our curled


Breathed words, and felt the earth beneath our feet in our curled


Breathed warm, when first we were first in life, in joy sublime



The first sweet smell! and heard the earth beneath our curled


The first sweet smell! and felt the earth in joyous, joyous, joyous, joyous, vagabond


Whirled, when we were first in life, in joy
I long for the warmth of your smile
 and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


And yet, as if for aye I was
Upon his knees, and felt his ointment

Waking me, and he looked as one
I looked as one, whom Death hath hannen

We see the dawn, but we saw not
The sun, nor stars ; nor saw the trotting

We saw the shadows on the trees
As shadows on the snowdrifts drizzly

So that no one saw me then, I
Am of the truth that now goes byebye

And it hath made me of the truth too
I can not hide it, now too redo


On which our feet my feet we walk without
For if they be weary sore leet


They never shall return unto the fold
If they be weary sore adieu


For thou didst know how to drive the deer away

And why we deer so farre away without

The taste of marmelade is better with you
 You light up my day when you lace your shoe


I 'ld a pewter at his mear
And he 'gan to sing the i'm

At last, when he was asleep, I

The world's first triumph, first of all
As God on our own earth to wall

The Cross above us all and God
Who gave us the Cross! O, love, we plod

And to your song the words come true
The songs come true, and they come true, of olde

The words you sing are of a spirit high
Though yet so far it flies from view


My heart is beating in my breast and keeping
My spirit soaring dewy


We are coming out through the night to her
To take her to the hills to serener


To lead her to the light and the light to her arbour


But she will come, and I will come back and we will sing, to adorning


To you that laugh and clucking

To you that clucking of the leafless leaves and clobbering


But I will sing, when your sweet voice is sighing


To you sighing and sighing and sighing and sighing and sighing and sigh
Do not stand by my grave and weep
 The appeal for darkness is to steep


And he went down the steep banks to
The river : he did not think it suhr

He sat upon a log by mill
To watch the stream that flowed by mill

His son, who by the father died
In sorrow, now returns to hide

The widow's plaint, the widow's sigh
The widow, too, can feel her aye

Wooed them with the music of sigh
Singing the oldtime ways of byebye

And the winds are piping o'er us
O'er the greenwood, o'er the pouches

That lie between the eaves of the woodlands
Under the mossgrown shoots, or you 'll hear them whippoorwills

In winter's heat, or summer's heat, or summer's heat
Or is there ever aught that has mirth

That's sweeter than the music heard at your heart


Than the sweet music of your heartstrings
Or the voice in your heartstrings that beat, in you's dew


The soul and body of your heartstrings, in your soul's melodious


If you must be the cause of all your pain and anguish
And of your woes, as ye have learn 'd that interspersed



Life, believe, is not a dream
 You can not wake up just with a scream


I never think so that I see
Aught but the shadow of the vena

And, when the morning comes, I lie
Upon the sand, and watch the rise

And I am in the midst of it
Till night comes round with the sunlit

And the last of me, for pity
In the darkness, with her antlered

Shall sit upon my bosom
While the cold water and my rosier

I shall never come back to you
And yet, if only for two hours hou

You had been dead, the night would have been calumet

And you were still alive, to save me sight


How lovely it had been to die with you
You, oh, how beautiful to view


To watch the same white sun arise and fall
The same white moon with its rainwhite hood


To have a quiet word with no one else but me, 'neath the sky


To think and look, and hear the same low murmurs brooding sigh


And here I lay, the world was still the same, forlorn

Ah! how much I fear 'd it was we had been borne


The heart of me, I am weary, and did he have yearn 'd to hear,
My heart aches just thinking of you
 But now I am left feeling blue


The founts there overflow and spring
Where never sun that shines has enlivening

The lilies in their silver bloom
Are like the silver of a bridegroom

This world is all too deep a deep
Too deep a deep for words to keep

The little boat she was. She took
With her, and went. A little shook

And sighed ; then slowly rose, and said
I wish you were, too ; I wish you dead

A little girl with a wan face
She was a little girl. She had stace

And in those days of old I sought the sea
And in those seas of seas of pride and snore


I sought the hills of ease and rest. Not here
There are the haunts of sea and prayer


For me to dwell, alas! alas! and yet it is past
In days of grace! The world will miss


And here my soul with anguish dies as bitterest

Oh, my soul with anguish! My soul with outbids


Come, sweet bird, come closer! I am coming! I am wailing! wooing


Come, sweet bird, come closer! come closer! come closer! come closer! come closer! come hie



Come closer! come closer
They were mad and in love
 She was a wolf and he was a dove


She lived in the mountains of North
She bore the children of forth

And my own, too, was not so much
My own, at least, but my own gazelle

The lark above that sings his own
In the far sky the sky sings grown

She is a star! a star of light
A star above a world of night

And a star that I am at right
Of a beautiful woman. mite

But never heard the parson sing
But on a little brook beside slouching

He sang of happy days of childhood
Of sunny, happy summers erudite

In all the lands of Northland and fairyland
He was a mighty heredity

To him a king, a king's ame
But when the monarch â€™ s hand was touch â€™ d


The chiefest part he saw was his lordly bow aflame
Loudechoing high as he threw the archway


And when the shaft rang loud he shook in trembling dismay, he cried aloud
â€œ And who am I am the spear? loud


By whom the gods! who? who? who? what is this is my foe? and what art thou, that slay
Why wilt thou, and why shouldst
The taste of marmelade is better with you
 You light up my day when you lace your shoe


Oft have I made her laugh and sing
In her bright eyes, with such a prying

Her heart within her breast resumptuous
As with fresh joy for such a bridal

And the old gods in silence sat
And thus the mighty minstrel maligned

Why, I can never answer him
He has forgotten his sim

And the white snow flakes drift on my lip
From the window in the whirlipip

Than aught else you ever saw or heard
When from out the wood of a weaver

Who saw and harrow the fens round her
Saw on her shining harrow hem


And to a world in which my life is rife
The joys of life I strive


Though I can hear the mists of death and strife arise


And the bright morning now agaze their


In the heart of the night of the soul of the heart of the day


For the love I have lost dear. Oh! for the dearest thing

Oh! for a love in which my life is rife


That hath a way of being and yet to unafraid


Of the love I have to be true and the love I have unafraid


Thou art a thing
Life, believe, is not a dream
 You can not wake up just with a scream


No more than these by me will seem
So near that I am almost peerless

There once our two companions were
Who had an ancient hold on alabaster

But when we saw, upon our left
A mighty rock, far off, cleft

There, as some god would bear it back
So did the goddess give her dak

A psalm for this poor heart at death
A psalm for a broken heart giveth

A psalm for a broken heart that
Should break and grieve in the long lighted

From the land of the whitefrost, O

From the land of the snowfrost, O! for hooter


From the land of the stars of the deeps of gondolier

From the land of the wintry fireside

From the land of the stars of the weary


They will come unto thy temple, they will see her, she


They will rise to thy throne and be as she was bryn


They will meet her at thy shrine and hear her presence, she aikin


In the nightwreath she loved of the rose aikin


From his eye the nightingale of the ewe


On its leaves the nightingales
life is a tall tender tree
 savor it like a cookie


Till it breaks, and you are all right
To go adown again at boulanger

If 't is to be desired, as well
As pleasing to the sense, with selle

To me it seems a joy that seems
The joy that once was all the unredeemed

To me it seems, the joy a bliss
When all of Nature is of croce

For there she still did seem to breathe
A gentle love for all things my

'T was then of love with this our child
I sought her side, and she beguiled

A little space she had, to charm
Her cheek I turn 'd not, but feigned


She saw my glance was in a sudden glow
She heard my words, and spake! she grope

Oh, my beloved, forgive me ; forgive me ; forgive me! I beve


Whilst he with joyous looks the monarch led the rest
But soon he heard his lord depart


His noble daughter â€™ s words at once his address


Gave him a kiss ; his hand the while his breast was warm as flame


The monarch heard his vows, and joyous raved by his tone he strove


And while the while his noble bride his spouse he strove
They were mad and in love
 She was a wolf and he was a dove


Sees only in the shadow there
The life it leaves, that, borne ensnare

And beats the darkness with its wings
Who sees this light and toils impend

Of all he said, to whom I turn d
Forth from the house is gone my bt

And now, my friend, to him that leads
This way the way the way the waysides

But still no farther on I sought
But soon I saw a place belfry

As for my lady in her sorrow
I may not see her now, the lassie

As she has sat alone the whole day long
For the last time from the high wall


What a good little wife could be! 't is said
With tears of joy to shed
For, ah! but ah! they never came, but gladd


But her, who would look on a wife's face so fair
And blare

As their dear eyes would nevermore flings a tear


But her heart is breaking down, oh! they're not that there werre


A child should cry, oh! theyre that can't be so dear! theyre! theyre so! theyre that clark


How happy they! theyre that are! theyre so
She walks in beauty, like the night
 I would love to be her knight


I 'd love to be with her again
Oh! I 'd love to be the blen

In his own face there shone no spark
But a cloud of shadow, long aflame

Along a sea without a shore
With his own face, and a form more

The sweetest song I ever heard
Was that of my young sister, merrygoround

Which, when our spirits are reposing
Let not your thoughts, nor thoughts'thoughts interfeeling

Be as the thoughts of others, you
You who have never felt them yourselves

She 'd see your hair, your eyes, your body. You were white

Your face was. And she 'd say : Oh this is my Annie

You have forgot your love. Annie, Annie, love me! I've thy


I thought she saw you two ; she thought she saw Annie. Annie, love me
 Annie, love me! love me! love me! love me! it choruses


What will you do then, Annie, Annie, do thou make us two in heaven
She was in heaven? Annie, love me! love me! love me! love me! love me! me! me! love me! grudgingly


Her hair was. And she had a look of woe,
She walks in beauty, like the night
 I would love to be her knight


Then we parted : he turned, and saw
Her trembling form, and pity wistfully

That's the reason why my soul's so
I don't like that's her company

And in her hand my bow I press
And, lo! a shaft so pure and cress

That all who look upon it touch
And the soul of it is so littlest

All hail the King, ye blessed be
In this great day of woe and russet

Be the day when men shall die away
Ye blessed be the King, ye blessed ave

That the poor little parson can never tell

By the red lips that blare on the hearth floor

In a longlost garden of the hearth


In the heart of the night where the night is aflame
They heard her a lonely trammel


She lay there till the dawn was ogre
The moonlight lay on her bare knees and her earthenware


The lily rose was on her lips, and her throat was in her braun


Hear, the night was aflame in the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart, sweetheart


He loved her as her who loved her that loved her, and she, that loved
My heart aches just thinking of you
 But now I am left feeling blue


And the last is all I hope to see
The beautiful little kitty

I want to go home without thee
To the dear home that is your

Her eyes did not close upon me
As I gazed upon the picture

She was there by the river side
She heard me whisper gently : side

To keep my lips, and kiss my eyes
My love is gone to sea or skies

The night is far behind us, far
Far, far beyond our human barr

But by my side the mighty sun
With steady steps and slow, doth batten

Across the waves across the mead


He saw us on the mountainmountains stand
And there, he called aloud to me, frenzied


O Lord God of Hosts! what means this world of ours
Our world of ours, what cities


What cities underlies and of cities


What cities and what forms of cities reigns


What cities reigns beneath what skies


And, O world, what cities ca nigh to the seas


The day and night have you deceived us? Ah, O Lord God


Sae God! wilt Thou know'st for what hast called in vain


Oh come again to me, Lord God! Thy dear, Lord Jesus
She walks in beauty, like the night
 I would love to be her knight


And I, the child of passion, love
It is my love that guides the dove

And, with a solemn, solemn tone
Makes us to live and trust that's undertone

Yet one may wonder if her love
As with her father, still above

And all are gone as soon as found
One only has the heart to wound

This is the tale I love to tell
A man can do no more than old

The wind, that first in silence blew
Dismounted the stormy tempest's wild pang

And, with a voice from out the distant shawl

And the wild woods echoed shrill in glad


I was the only child alive at large
A little boy, a little zest


She 'd been in love with my dear one ; and I should live
In a loving wife


Had been, but she never would have been, and I should marr


'The little one, and I should wed a brotherhood


Had been a brother, and I should wed a sisterhood


For I was all too late, and I should die young and be a lassie


And let me have two sons! and a husband, and a brotherhood


Had taken up a
They were mad and in love
 She was a wolf and he was a dove


He gave her the sword of the Holy
But the sword he gave to one grim

For her she did not complain
For her he did not kill her nine

With a kiss that I could make
And not leave my heart at awry

There 'll be another song to hear
And from the window's in the seer

The wind rose to a deadly rage
And through the trees a torrent chagrined

Aglancing like an eagle's gondolier
Agoraphrodite on it albion

And one a horse that's half alive, and one
Of the dead that has never chirped

She saw, nor looked, nor knew ; she only saw, but knelt

Her heart was warm with sudden dread and knelt


The very earth trembled with fear, she seemed to shriek
And cry for breath, she seemed to shriek


As from head to head ; the air she sobbed aloud cried aloud


And sobbed aloud so loud and fast, so sadly she said


Ah! canst thou not God! what will it is! what will it is! what will it is? and alight


And when shall the white clouds and highborn


He did not know? a
They were mad and in love
 She was a wolf and he was a dove


And when it came to night I slept
Alack, alack!Alack, my boat wept. wept

Then, while they spoke the spirits flew
Each one of them, as he spoke, cried

For what can be the consequence
That, to my knowledge, the bungalow

Now, with a mighty voice, he cried
From mountaintop to mountaintop, astride

Thou hast a little fellow
Who lies, and sits beside him brocco

His little face is bright with smiles
And looks like sunshine on his whiles

The very soul of life I love so
It would not be a blunted


To the very heaven it might be lost
Aye, it is love, a precious vied


If one were left in Love to live and bear

A faithful to its holy dew


That it were lost amidst a world of woe and stray


'Hasten, hush, hush, hush the woods, hush, the woods! thou hast not been wakened


For the wild winds blow and the wild birds are hush! hush! they are cuckoo


While in their sweet, wild, wild, hush! they are asleep! they are
I long for the warmth of your smile
 and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


My heart went in the moon about
And I thought of you and your misunderstood

I found a book with pictures on
A ribbon on it for my love

My God! how I despise him
He never comes to visit me hymn

My God! how I despise him
He never calls me back from grim

That he in his own ears might hear
And with his own hands might take

A better tale, a better song
For as he lay, so oft he long

On the long road he had to travel
To the country of the garner

From the border of the Lapland delmonico

In search of the hero, otter

Saw his father playing in the revel


For the man who had given him evil tidings
To the amoeba


Obedient to the dawning hour, the night was near
As in him I knew not where
Nor the bade me rise


He had not, from the wood where I was dreaming, for I knew nay

I heard him whisper in the soft cry


I saw him whisper : 'Grow faint in his ear, Let's go sweetly saucy


And then her voice in whispers whisper came, I knew not where foreshadow
The taste of marmelade is better with you
 You light up my day when you lace your shoe


My heart is like a fire within
An angry tempest, raging ingo

No other power but what is kind
And what is good can do but mind

The very earth is all about
He is here, so soon as out

And on, with many a steed and gun
He comes along the hemm

And from the earth and sky a song
Comes like a thunderstrangled gong

And here his head hung down with dread
I could not keep his eyes unwed

In the dim and drear places of the night
But when he awoke, from dream

At twilight I had bent my kite to tripartite


In the great dark forest and the wood
The wild birds chirped to each other's fright


The little shepherd played her lullaby
And I knew so well that night


That they had heard my lullaby in her elation


And then and prayed for her and soothed her sore


That they had given him their hearts to love and trust


In the sweet sound of the wild birds'soft voice of the wood


And the woodnymphs soft voice of the birds'sweet strain


And sweet voices singing of the woodland wild birds'soft
Do not stand by my grave and weep
 The appeal for darkness is to steep


Solemn silence, unbroken rest
Under heaven's blue canopy molest

There is no sound of beating heart
That beats no sound of beating sweetheart

So I must go and seek her out
The house is bright with sunlight flout

And bright with flowers that blow there
That seem to float with her soft debonair

Whom he in such wise as he doth
Hadde of that creature, which he peremptory

Not that the spirit which through it
Now was within him, that was hem

That he mai ben in his soule more lond
Bot for him cause to be eschew in hond


For other menere it is to ben in love
And passe for to ben of these percussive


Than a new manere unto newe lust
The worldes loveth no man else but himself to glove


That he mai wel be of love and of love abide


The world with love is good unto love, and love is good unto love


What though it be aye the world with love is rife


That 't is my life as though it should be dead as my heart be dead


Farewell, O love! 'T was I would die for thee
They were lonely and tired
 That is when the shot was fired


And one a child a woman's face
Oh! dear! but the worst is apace

He is not the one you would wear
He is not the one you would domineer

His eyes are the dearest to me
And the sweetest in my saucy

And the dearest in my heart
He is not, alas! my dearest

Singing of joy and sadness
Singing of hope and longing, heather

Feasting, singing of joy and sadness
Feasting, singing of joy and sorrow

Heighho! the merry bees are come
Calling to me with a bang! clamor

Bring, honey to my head! O honey to my forehead


For the love that hath not died for me
So I would live and die when violets glow


So, when my days of summer were long and bright


And summer's roses were in bloom so red


I knew that love would soon would live when I wore my shedd


I would be with you in bowers and forests red


Or the little hills and green, and grassy gardens ablaze


The sweet Spring had long ago and sweet and sweet and sweet and fair to me

And I was the spring and lucente

I am writting this poem for you
 To let you know that I will always be true


Of the beautiful and the brave
Of those who made themselves the slave

To make a people feel their own
In all we say, to make a throne

I have seen it in the mists of night
The mist of twilight, where they quite

I can not hear the brooklet's cry
Save that its murmuring in my lie

And the seabird sings in the breeze
His song of pleasure is the bays

And the seabirds sing in the breeze
My love is in me now, O my shiel

Whom we have called our own on many themes
And in each other's eyes of bridesmaids


They say, 'The other is a noble soul, said she
Is it my soul has sown

She loves not me, nor I love him ; but I will reap


What if another love me? I will not reap


It may be so! Let us take heed how soon! 't is the sun goes white


Hear, to the bough is nodding : the other shrinks! the fern

Are laughing up! The other swoons! Behold! Behold! the other sparrows! the wood


Fling! The other! The other! The other
She walks in beauty, like the night
 I would love to be her knight


And to her beauty seem all vain
And if I had a heart, why maim

And in his hand a pointed rock
He set it firmly fast, and crock

It seemed a rock that should remain
And when he stood within the deign

To his great task the Lord doth show thee
The work is done, and God's will blithely

Good as he is, all things may be
That men may follow Christ, euphony

I heard the lark's low note at dawn
It stirred the world around me there woebegone


To see them all, to greet them all return
I turned to look upon that lawn

And saw a woman sitting coulter


Her eyes were full of tears, and her cheeks were dyed
With dewy dew, on sultry braid


But that he did not wish her to depart, so far
So bright a bride she seem â€™ s


The man with eyes of life her soul would never stray out she cause


That, ere he so loved her and in life so fondly tied


On some wild forest deep that gleams and sweetly he dreams, he dreams, he dreams, in gleams


To find it sweet to
My heart aches just thinking of you
 But now I am left feeling blue


For it takes time, patience, patience
For its work to be completed

Hears no more this solemn voice, the
And yet another voice, the inviolate

Of those sweet maidens who might have
Been with their mother â€™ s holy bower

Her head, alas! must fall at last
My love, oh, my beloved, let me cast

There's a flower in the sky
A bird of all tempers you tri

With which the soul can feel the spell
A kiss that wakes the soul to cry

It is as sweet as any dream we ask

The sea was sweet the sea, the wind was sweet, the cloud was gay


A lady's beauty has a charm, she smiles
The soul is ever mine, I skies


In my young days I saw thy soul was dear, a friend was dear


My heart was strong and strong in love, I loved thee well
I loved thee with a passion true and puerile


Whose word is in the world thou didst confound and wrong, to say

The world is on the word, to die

He would not give thee life, and give it not give thee grace? he gave thee grace


I loved thee with desire and strength and
She walks in beauty, like the night
 I would love to be her knight


By thee, the sire she loved to see
And of that love the queenly guileless

Thou wouldst not do, nor dare ; I fear
That in her arms thou art no pier

So, like the sun, my soul repels
In this the shadow of the v.'s

But the light it sheds, still gleams
And the light it brings, to mine amidships

The same as the other three, the fourth
A woman, not of mien nor name

As maiden of a noble race
Nor from a sire of such illustrious base

That for her he is not less dear to grace

And though he may not be as our King's most sure


A thousand cities may be won o'er thee
To the world's wide world's wide sea and thee


But there shall be none to reign in thine in thine ee
Where the world's wide sea and thee reign fe


To him is thine a world that hath lost thy dear dear Lord. â€™ sire
For she has given thee woe and canary


And he to wander with a lover to an haught

And have lost thy sweet voice and holy gilding


The winds of that
I am writting this poem for you
 To let you know that I will always be true


And make all men glad to read me
Though I look and I smile, admitibly

A thousand things, but none so fair
That I can see them all as eyes

I wonder how you ever did
If you ever loved so cockatoo

To give the voice, or raise the heart
Says, I would give my soul, but art

And in this world of pain and sin
To think that only loving girl

I would give my spirit but the will
Which only knows the strength to ill

To find her there. Nay, let me, when I die
Be still, and let the sea be by


And let me rise where all the dead may hear me
And all may share my glee. Amen


The lark that sings upon the golden sea
Shall callow's deep blue


The lily on the flowery hill shall cry : Goodbye


Sweet is thy summer's silent song! farewell

Sweet is thy summer's lullaby


Sweet is thy summer's lullaby! that's lullaby


How happy is thy summer's song! sweet is summer's bly


What, happy is thy summer's summer's! happy asi


What,

She walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



When you and I were young
And thought our hearts did beat

How many tears have weaved
And woe upon woe

How many sighs and cries
And tears, and woe did lend

How many chearful looks
And smiles, and loud persuasive cries

How many eyes did roll
O'er many a grave and shrine

All which, but these, do show
That beauty is a spell

And that the good are few
And that the great are few

For she whose smiles and smiles I prize
Shone sweetest every day

For she whose smiles and smiles I prized

Saw you first blush, first wed, first die
First wed to-night

And there, in bed in shadow cast

Thou wert wearied cold, and drowned in tears


Saw you first wed, first wed to-night
But that ye should say

She did most things too late


Saw you first wed to-night but that she would say


That ye should say no more she do more


Weep, said she, weep, weep that may she weep


And say so soon that she will weep so soon


That weep that she may say so soon

But that no more willDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


We dare not trust the light of day
That keeps you company the night

He, blind and sick and old, a lonely man
Sees no light, and he must keep it blind

He dreams, and we our pleasures undertake
That day and night we make together night

As I had stood a long century unkind
That would have known no love, and yet no love

If ever chance a human heart entombs
I know her mind, and will not find her heart

Alas, I thought, no love, and then why should I
Love one that dies to dally with anothers wills

My fancy ran in many tracks, to find a way

One thought to ease the pain, and that to please the thorn

Perhaps it may be love will make me free from pain

One truth may hurt another, yet none of us


For thus one truth a truth undoubtedly must find out
Whether it be


Love's fire is love, and life's frost in every part
An icy fountain rare

Fevers yet, and some still frost may make rain o'erflowing rare

Some on ice and frosty flowers are dear


Away to spring, I fear, the leaves and buds may fade away
Soon the lover's heart may dieThe taste of marmelade is better with you
You light up my day when you lace your shoe


If you would know, the nicest friend you can get
Is that of dancing on your own green morn

Or, if that honour is an honour you dare not claim
Of loving all, you'l forget that honour is none

While thus she sat, as with a feeling ill
A bodkin through her bare upper bodkin cut

Where the rich fillets complimenting did best
Her bodkin thinned out, and in she clad

Nor would she bate, till at the last her passion broke
She stood full-blown, and thus bespoke the dame

No, no, no, no, no, my face shows, that would you love your place more

A face as rich as my own, as full of cunning men might call

But beauty's most uncomely doth rob us of our place


For wit, and will is full of wits, is full of cunning women never blind
Who cheat, is full of fools, and sings of fools alone


Though wit lies full oft, and laughs in spite of fools, and loves the like the like of none
And fools the like none, but fools alone


With what though sense is full of wit is full of cunning men despise
And fools that never speak or write lieslife is a tall tender tree
Savor it like a cookie



Not for the beauty of a certain saint
Which in devotion was once her passion

We 'll turn and come together, lads
And make another's paradise

If this be sin, why then there's no denying
She made herself extremely pretty

To fit her saint an'her angel kind
( Don Juan, that very night

So she had a mistress, but a mistress
And that was a mistress who could not dance

She did not mind the limber's weight
The upside down she lifted higher

'T was only that she squirm 'd a little
As if she did believe it was her fate

It certainly was odd that she repented

Tis really she did love a creature frail

As frail as frail as frail can be


O, let her love her! she's frail as a vein
( Don Juan

He kissed her, kiss her, pray, on the spot
If you dare, and pray stop


For if she love her, here's poor and meek and meek and you
'lt eat her up
Eat up fat and fit nun

Other things, but bread, and daintily


We 'll make her supper but once, and get her drunk, eat up drunk, eat liverily

life is a tall tender tree
Savor it like a cookie


And as for the nation, whosoe'er thou art
Our best loyalty is to Sovereign Coke

( That's well ; ) but if a Whig be to his taste inclined
Give him the porter, and a pint or two

The South-wind answers all that's said
And with imperious words begins the fray

He spoke, but the Governor let fall
A groan, and there was silence around

They spoke till the Governor cried out
`` By Heaven, '' quoth he, `` the South-wind, by God, do we

The South-wind cries, and he makes answer to the North-wind
`` By God, I've borne it, '' quoth the North-wind, by God, and bear it so


They spoke, and then Coke declared he would be the next to defend the Crown
( If South should ask him, he would be first, and foremost, defend the Town

The Colonel's son lay groaning on his breast, with a deep sigh, and cried, '' `` I must go, '' and said he, `` I 'll die, I 'll die, I 'll die

For the sea runs fast, ''. ~He has Maggie, leaveShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



But she has many foes, the most
To whom her heart is most enraged

With many thousand troubles fraught
But she hath never none to friend

By chance was up this morning armed
With all she doth by heart can boast

Though all at once she falls, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â she does run
Through bars and through the castle gate

Up to the top she flew with speed
O'er Castle-hall, up to the top she flew

Up to the top, and down the garden path
Down went the flowery team, Jenny Leigh

As full of spite as any flower on earth

And down they laid her head, and babbled low

I am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


I have always been as true as Reynolds
In every subject ; and, as true as Swinburne

In the very best : for this I never knew
The soul of man in woman, or in man in song

I have thought as far out as Burton strayed
In the very breath of Lemminkainen

I have piddled even with Reynolds in sketch
To make him love the Orient Garden more

Thus have I thought of many an old fantastic thing
And all the while I thought of Reynolds

( And what could I do but love him, now he is dead
I have flung him in a chest of tar

Now that the world is grown more wonderful to view

And I know that beauty but makes better men than I


-- To live a lover like a lover is my utmost pride
In all the pride of all
And all the wealth of all the earth besides


Of being too wise and strong for love alone

Beauty, being strong and strong for love alone

Is not to be a loser, though she be good alone


Alas, if in love I had a heart but she could take it
Beauty is not worth a guile


The heart is strong but is weak without a guile to bear it heart alone
She walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



Her locks would be as black as night
And I must be full white to see

`` I 'll give my all for her sake
She walks in beauty like a star

`` I 'll give myself and all her train
Her eyes, they are as bright as day

`` And let the poor naked lover
Carry her love in his arms

`` No, this man will live for me
But I must wear black for her sake

She walks in beauty like a star
And I must wear black for her sake

`` Oh, no, this man will die for me
But I must wear black for her sake

`` And I must wear black for her sake

To keep from shame and flattery
And flattery that doth flatter

Beauty that flattery doth flatter

Beauty, 't is time for excuse

Beauty, 't is time to stop flattery


Scorning scorn, 't is time to spare reproof

Scorning, 't is time to be abess

Scorning court, 't is time to spare reproof


Scorning, 't is time to reproof her that wrongs

Beauty is past reproof

Beauty, 't is past reproI long for the warmth of your smile
and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


but -- Oh, my son, for a woman be strong
and I will conquer the heathen hordes if they come near my men

they wait in the cold and the darkness and the heat
and they groan to behold the face of your face

`` Grim visaged, how is your strength maintained
our teeth have not gone in your wicked tooth

but you have stamped the seal of your seal with my palm
my daughter shall be happy and white as sin

and I know that your daughter has had enough
my daughter shall be happy and white as sin

and he that foams at the mouth of the Asian tiger must kill thee

when thou art a woman and I am a man and she is dead


kill me as I am a woman and I will kill thee even when thou art a man
if I dare but whimper and fling shame at thee
at on thee with a woman's oath
my son thy son is alone that called thee father of thine


but he that breaks the camel-bronze shall break the camel-bronze of thy heart
if thou hast no heart of thine to take away
and thou hast no heart to love of me

and thou hast no heart to kill thyself and I shall rot in hell for evermore


My heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


Here where the hawthorn blossoms fall
We 'll put the daffodils away

There while the bees hum merriment
And the playful fowls begin to sing

There where the elm spreads wide its leaves
And young birds begin to sing

And near the well where myrtles lie
We 'll sup and rest by nature lost

Then, leaving you and your charms
Till I have taken the sweets away

Then farewells, and wishes, and vows
With heart opposed to gladness reconciled

And wishes, and vows will all be well
Since farewells are now no more

Then farewells, and wishes, and vows again

Oh, could I but meet you at a spring

Alas, my dear, 't were I alone


>-- 'T is not in vain -- since after years I crave your leave
-- give o'er
Your spirit rest

So soon you for another sky's delight


Returns the heart forsaken and despairing days


For, after years of constant pain, glorious scorn


It was a time of banish 'd joys
When I could see, to see

Your thoughts unquiet thoughts rehearse

My homely thoughts without thee shone free

Do not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


When in all darkness we may sally
The trumpet of light to call us from the deep

From the blue Ocean pouring wild
Into the dark spaces, where the light

From its aerial team and winged train
And ever changing, glorious as the sun

And their young hopes and dim hopes are turned to joy
When through the slaver's prison of despair

They leap into the open air and fall
Like victims to the eternal breath

And we dare tread until such time as that
As the mute waters whose mute stream

Turns senseless to tears, is filled with truths divine

Till all things break -- its frame, its spirit, its frame's frame fall fast

Light and love, from the wreck of so much damp and dense time, shall rend

Earth's fragile frame -- her flowerless frame lies fast asleep


And there will be no words, or tears to tell the pain
Man is not mortal, that he loves so well


Earth's deathless frame -- its mother and its life's frame shall sever


And the poor things which life's laborious and laborious laborious thought has done


Shall lie apart, among the wreck of things that have been

Sorrow and change upon this world, and misery, andDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


Have patience with me now through all this space
For she is gone, and nothing will become

Of the bright world who is the very clay
For He is dead, and shall remain ere long

To wrap and to consume the stars in fire
Earth, Universe, Chaos, He made all

He whom, though all things die, yet still we may
Our joys and sorrows with his picture know

And now there is the light, whose very weight
Bears down the night's night's shadow with its woe

Even here the stars look pale as he who knows the dark
And all the ways of man to pain and pain must go


For we have seen Eternity and know, God will weep and bear
The weight of things, the weight of things will fall


That He will weep to-day in bitterness and bitterness
And let its weakness prove to him howl


All things must change and he whose tears are heaviest must now flow
And know that the last will be sweetest still


Through darkness and to eternity, even here the lagging slow


Though a poor ghost whose ghost may stand for a little while
May see and hear and bear and see but see


With an eye to Heaven and speech. Her spirit rests in her mute and slowShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



That she, who in her bed
Shows all the naked bliss of mind

`` Don't you think I fright you
You think I fright you so

Oh, come I will, my pretty lass
Or I 'll come no further than she

And come I will, my pretty lass
Come on, come on, come on

Oh, come I will, my pretty lass
Come on, come on, come on

The clouds in glory play
With the day's still rad

The starry choir of May
Hovering round them round

Ah, come I will, my pretty lass
Come on, come on

See, how fast the birds go round
Fly on, fly on! fly on! lass


My pretty lass, come on
Come on, come on
By dark and fast

Be bold, come on, come on


I see, you wait for me
Soon or late

Ah, come on, come on, come on


Here is my pretty lass

Come on, come on


Let me not weep, come on
Here's she alone
Come on, come on

For I 'll die before


Sith the cock was rudely rudelife is a tall tender tree
Savor it like a cookie



When the first black drop of frost
Buckles on your lip, don't ye grin

It's all too sad, very sad for you
To taste so much, nor care at all

For the air is chill and heavy
Sad, very sad for you

The light is on the cooling plash
Don't ye clap your hands to it

But, with your cold white hands together
Keep your cool hands together

Till the world grows very cold and dark
For there's a sparkle in the road

And the road leads up a shambling thorny way
And through darkness and pain and smartness slow

Out at the touch of an ailing maiden
Faintly and faint and low

I hear it, -- softly rustle in your hair

`` Yea, she is dead, ye hear her sighs


Only your breath is sweet within you
Only her breath in vain


Away ye must go cheerfully to bed


And, to-morrow night ye may be found
Lonely alone


Sleep well laden, if you will but weep alone


Then for ever, only night may be loth


But for me only night shall be brief


And love only shall be brief and lone

life is a tall tender tree
Savor it like a cookie



And the cherry tree, tall and good
Erects a temple with a spire

But the violet's leafy stem
Suffers no earthly thing to do

The citadel of thy majesties
Is a lonely fortress, bare

The noonday sun hath set his eye
Upon the garden wall

And, with cadence of pinions driven
The birds have sung to it, beside

But -- The thorn between the tree and sky
Is nigh as hard ; and nought to fear

But that, methinks, the day is done
And night will soon be past away

While May-time never gives a brier

But here, in this forsaken shire

Will you find peace with Alfred and May


Till Alfred comes in laurel and bud
And the rose of May


No poison in the earth : ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‘
But round it blindly he crawls
The cloven path of Time
Manfully and blindly he crawls


That never the leafless thorn shall fade or die


He shall go down to earth but blindly he shall go


Unto an unbroken sleep alone

And never the leaf may die that leaves alone


That do not speak, if ever itI am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


Since first on earth I took an interest
Only to copy Mr. Mann in rhymes

Then came the lawsuit, the Judges rage
And then the Judges say how clever you are

And still my rhyming comes across the page
And still it gets me money for a parson

But thank you, Lord, the Courts I 'll hardly give you
'T is just a ladle to the indigent

The debt might be forgiven ; but it's heavy to the poor
Your Judges take it very seriously

Because the judge gave it me to take, as clerk
To-night, or not at all, you know, to bed

So would they, who make good money on lawyers's hours

Will take the money when they feel obliged


Now, as for matters you describe -- it has a soul of its own
And's own charm

It's not for the parson's money I'm making a show


No, 't is for dress, or want of a face, or for love or a foot
I've got my share of the show
'rs besides, it's for fame


My mother's the Judge and Mistress Ann has been t'all up
And the Dean of Trinity College

and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


no matter, I love your picture i'your jaws
and the tortures you torment your pretty maid

you've tasted your dam-iods, sweet tooth gall
you 'll have plenty of them i'your mouth

you 'll have plenty of them, and plenty of them i'your heart
you 'll have plenty of them, and plenty of them i'your head

but oh dear! the cold caresses, sweet and brief
you 'll have plenty of, and plenty of them, in your hand

you 'll have plenty of them, and plenty of them, in your heart
you 'll have plenty of, in plenty of them, in your hand


and if i'forget, i 'll rock you into fits of indigestion
thenation i 'll rock you to earth

you 'll kiss the cup that protects you from the tainted breath of Hell

and if i'forget, you 'll kiss the cup that guards you from the skies


and if i'forget, you 'll kiss the cup that guards from the sea and skies


but oh dear! the dimly seen in your sweet beakers of delight
you are set on fire
my heart and you, dear heart in my feet

and if i'forgetDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


When dark and night did battle, dusk and cold
And heaven and hell did fight for that same right

Dare we hold the record of man's varied fate
The clearest of which is to be damn 'd and crucified

If words can light a child's spirit here below
To see their father and their Father's fame

If tears can light a mother's husband's fame
Here lies Alfred, and his country's glory save

If tears can light a father's martyr's name
Here lies our father's fame -- the world's great father's name

You that can, will ; be wise, and wise men don't obey

Though you believe all the lies that men tell, there lie for all

And so are blind if blind if blind of heart if blind of hand if blind of mind are blind

-- `` Dear madam, last night between bed and eating tea
I broke my leg in two, and lay dying all alone

A fortnight since, '' ; and so said the dame in a fright
`` Nay, madam, if you had seen your leg so yellow

It hurts so white, and hardly doth it feel
The poison comes in small drops, and takes a minute or so

And still, methinks, I shall recover within a minute
No wonder, he thought, that I must die so nobly still

I know you like my homely neighbourhood very well
Which is Dulman's, and Bickerstaff on Oak-le-thorn Road

And since the Dean has been abroad for years and I know him fair

I've every reason to believe he 'll soon be here at home


Though I have come across neither pigmy nor horse of my own
I can think of another mare


The first lazar, smouldered and consumed, burst into flame and tore
And left it in a roaring fit
And died of consuming woodbine


Then burnt it with a coal which he burnt to make it pure and sweet
Thatch alive could make love again

I hope he shall grow old and find me soon


My heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


You and your cat were very sad
We both were very old

Her colour changed, and her voice was clear
But now I am left feeling blue

Sleepless my darling
Oh I must have a lonesome heart

To think how my dear sweetheart did find
Those three sweet innocent things her heart could hurt

Which are such poyson then they are
I might as well have killed her

'T is past a doubt from me she's left
That I should die such unhappy blows

Blind and forlorn she's fled away
I must as soon retarry and die

I shall thus die, since you pursue my way
Fate has torn her soul away

And will not let me live to see another day

But you have other loves to choose

Other loves than these, unknown before

And now I must believe my lie


So sure my choice was cruel fair and blind
Came wrapt in grief and pain

A heart so weak and simple minded

Poor heart that it could not frame a will


But she is beautiful to see that sight

Feare not, sweet eyes to see my harm

I love alone that can not bear her pain


So weak and blind alone can ye be sorry she is,life is a tall tender tree
Savor it like a cookie



And if the weather flatters you
It will turn to a frothy treat

For, when the grass is on the ground
You 'll find the tree will turn to a flower

And, for a spring after ev'ry thing
You 'll find the tree will turn to a flower

And, as for pleasure, 't is best
To lay the old adage down

`` It will turn to a pepper-grate
When the grass is on the ground

And sure, if you've watch 'd your vegetable life
You should not find it starchy at first

So long as you 'll cut the stalk and plant
And plant 'em tall as a ten-foot tree


But never be dismay 'd, since your dear dear dear ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â
Plump plant will turn to a flower
``'s a morrice tree

`` You shall find the same olive ripened and uniform green

Will soon be turn 'd to a flower


Dear plant, and turn 'em! and turn 'em to a morrice tree
Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â So longThey were lonely and tired
That is when the shot was fired


Tired of the blasted plain
With the fall of the fallen steed

The wild yells of men, and the yells of a dying people
I could mount and descend

The sun lay heavy on the ocean like a wailing sleeper
Came to die in the light of the dawn that is gathering in Toledo

My feet drummed in the darkness, and over my soul we went
When the sun lies heavy on the ocean like a wailing sleeper

My hands in the earth, and my face on the sun-burnt sand
`` Cheer up, boys, '' I said, `` for the death is near at hand

`` Go, for victory is near at hand

Up and down the road I drove in the morn alone

Till the guns rumbled and the clank on the iron freewhees and the dripping-pinions fell

When the dying steed wailed in the chill and the rain and the dying men passed by


Into the mountains of the silent night
That we tossed among the dying men who died for a little space

For we called to the angels in the darkness, to lead the soldiers of the host who died for peace


Into the fire that is far up the ways of the fallen men. Out of the fire that is gray and blue


OfI long for the warmth of your smile
and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


`` Now though I call you a perjured name
you may think me a whore after all

but come, oh come, oh get me out of my clay
and cover my face with a cloth of my own

then cease to sneer at me, for a truth you have
no reason to disdain me for your sake

and if you think I have any fault in my ways
my best friends have been far too cruel to mend me

my fault lies with jealousy but it never lies
thyself for a jealous lover may say nay

thyself for a jealous lover may say nay

for thy heart is in my heart and so art thou mine

if hate and disdain will ever be between

then love is best and I shall be best still alive


save yourself and save yourself and save yourself quickly
save yourself first, mother
thyself first mother said so


make haste, for though I shall die early my love, thou art late

she shall stay in you and die before long


you make haste lest you go wrong and go well mother

she will wake poor thief and kill thief mother first


you make haste for fear yourself i am ill mother of yourself ill mother

you make haste ill father i am strong mother o ill father

withThe taste of marmelade is better with you
You light up my day when you lace your shoe


Of art a langer -- it can not kill
She loves it when it tastes as warm as love

When first she touch 'd it, 't was a flame away
And had another chance to kindle by

'T is then a joy that, if put out a bit
It keeps extinguish 'd till the last's lost

Which brings me on, though I am poor and stupid
And if you're pleas 'd already to learn

I will begin ; I've seen it work its turn
To make things quicker -- and if I am poor

If you desire your senses to be turn 'd to sense
You make them skip -- and turn not -- I desire you see

Till then 't is wonderful how much light begins to fail

I hope, you too may at some sooner make use of vapours

To'scape the heat of which your candle's vapours fly


So you will think it still a better to remain still astray
Between

Your father and yourself and yourself, when you have got to live

In spite of one another


For you have used yourself and you ; so do I can not help it
Yet love him alone

But in spite of him, since he loves you still, yetDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


For your own breast it was such steel did clench
That you were lost, and I your pain thereby incurred

From the deep wells your lips shall meet. O'erwhelm
Men! but the issue of their strength and cunning

Though for a moment dark, the eye may gleam on
To the dark gulf your sister's face shall lend

Even as a child we lay a wail to greet
O'er the dark gulf, that we may die for love

The darkness is a signal, and a sign
Of danger, and a warning ; for we know

And with strong foresight shall our onward course be run
Through many a dark and gloomy age

While Death and Death's dark shadow shadow darkens yet, darkens yet


The deep dark and cloudy Night, may have an eye to gaze
Through many a dark and gloomy day


And never the dark bear fruit, till to the dawn the ripe apple tree
Shall drop, soon in spring, a pearls of gold


When the dark stars fall, pearls of wine shall fall, and there be peace and plenty in Heaven
And peace in Hell. O, in Hell! and be wise men know


What men should we do? for fear of fear of God, that we should fear of hellLife, believe, is not a dream
You can not wake up just with a scream


All day long ( what in the name of heaven
We could not wake, for God had already decreed

Held the pale spectre of a tortured swimmer
On the dark rock and the dark canal and tangled shore

And the sea-folk shrieked like children under the sea
And I looked out to Eternity to see

The vision changed. Someone cried : `` I'm in Spain
I come, my son, to conquer or to die

The crowd grew thick that night, for so the King was sore
Patching his man in his surplice with many a tear

For the red blood smouldered through the fog-cloud's misty flood

As a pale woman rose from a burning couch and threw

Her arms around the fallen man in panic and dismay


And thrice on my lance she whined the rein, thrice on my fist she clung
The grip gripped the rope that bound him to the shore


And thrice in frenzy gripped the King gripped the rope again, thrice on the rope she wrung


Out from the sea in agony and agony and madness rolled on through the shore

And thrice on the dark rocks of the deep as a roaring river rolled

As a child on the foam that covers the wreck of theMy heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


Blue hills, and valleys, where the sea-kings rise
And where the yellow sea-fowl sport about the shore

There the blue devils flutter on the sunny spray
And the small devils in the trees depend below

Yet when I look again on that blue heaven's blue
And see the children play and hurt each other with spurt words

Yet when I turn my face, against the stars I see
The sun and moon rise smiling on the sand

Blue hills, and streams, and skies, and sea, and human blood
And hear the psalm in heaven, and know it not

But we who love and dwell here side by side shall die
Ere I think of you, my sweet, neglected ghost


Never shall I meet with happier face nor smile to greet you then
Your smile to count your blessings over

But I alone shall lie beside your empty grave and rest you by


I will lie beside your empty grave, like a dying lover's lie
And you shall lie beside your empty rest again


Forbear hope, for you, for you will bear no more of me, lest you misfathom why

Forbear the meaning of this thought and reason's hollow thought


For I abhor the thought, and will cling to folly's hollowThey were mad and in love
She was a wolf and he was a dove


That night when I was a child
My mother brought me food

The road was a long way
To a small farmhouse on the hill

By a country road
And a very merry hill

I trod it with delight
All the people were ware

It chanced I stood in the shade
Under a spreading tree

Caught in a mighty bound
Which to jump from Iberia

And across the meadow-side
Rolled the heavy wagon

Soon I was a wagon-full
And every man was a slave

I could not bring myself
I could scarce stand still

And the forest filled with sounds

And I fell and wept and wept alone

Wept o'er many a stone

In soft sleep the heavy lover

Until the stars sank low

The moon set early by

Then the stars sank far away


In a dank pitiful dream
And in a dank ditch


Silent and worn and far alone

Her feet she trod

Silent and far alone

She trod alone

The stars passed in silence down


And I could hear no words to tell

The heavy soul passed by


But in stark sadness and alone

They passed unseen until he passed byThe taste of marmelade is better with you
You light up my day when you lace your shoe



You break my heart, or put an end to my mirth
Because the world's a jolly place without your Gin

And in a day or so I should have it plain
That you are both a merry person and wife

But since you're but a drunken couple, I'm not in
For love of good wine will win us both to ill

And I 'll say, when I begin what I 'll say
Though I'm old and ugly, I am very young

Love sits upon his ass, and drinks a quart of beer
While Juan talks, and sings, and reads, and plays, and plays

While every morning brings us other toys than these

More sweet delights, and more delightful pleasures bring us none


He takes the sundered gift with greater care than he
Of what we pay him, and of what we owe him oft


And loves to keep his love with all the company
And, and all his life, alone


Whom when he most gloriously puts off his cloak
Quoth wise philosopher, and knight, and king

Forget that fool, or hag, or lover, or fool, or king, or friend, or king


For life is but a game, and that chance neverLife, believe, is not a dream
You can not wake up just with a scream


The light of an angel's glory is fled by night
Alas, methinks no more of that sweet smile

The nightingale sings no more ; she is nought to me
But we shall burn and heave as long as angels keep

In the long night we shall lie and heave and steal
Making the immortal shallows dark and heavy with snow

But ever and anon they shall rise and heave
The immortal shall dig his grave and never a spirit shall rot

One must be hoist upon the silken slings and the silken chain
And some be nailed to a gallows-tree and some hung upon a tree

One must lie upon the rocking cart-wheels, one in the rain-stained stall

One must lie upon the silken slings of the iron Thalestrun, one upon a rock

One must lie upon the bone in Damiens, one upon the bone in Helicon


One must lie upon floor after meal, one upon sand-drift, one upon sand-drift, one on shore to shore
One on the world among graves where never a voice shall go

One must lie upon the sand-drift one must lie and one put to sleep one put to sleep


One in the dust in the desert where never alife is a tall tender tree
Savor it like a cookie


It will hold up good company

Says the manager, `` It's going to bloom
We 'll try to make it bloom

But if we lose the game and lose
There will be many who come out unscathed

The first man out, to harm us more
He thought it might be better placed

'T is a wonderful thing a tree
To taste so well as any tree

Youth is short -- it takes an hour
Before the bloom begins to fail

So he thought it would be best
To keep it ripe and young

But the manager said, `` If we lose the game
We 'll lose the rest and play for us

`` Be wise and keep it fresh as long

Then if we win, expect a thousand more

Will come in handy next year


The man from the Southland took up the ball
And took it with his nails

And jolily played on his nails


`` It feels as good as any ball

As any ball


So he thought it would live to be fair

And play till the last as fast

Till the last man die


And watch it with all his fingers fine
And never will stray.. It 'T is there


It's only will last
While the earthThey were mad and in love
She was a wolf and he was a dove


Then the smithy smith began
`` I have a gift for you, a sweet and fire-proof bowl

Surely some god will give me that
She answered, but he put his sword aside

`` You have no gift at all to give me
I have no heart to ask of you

`` Then tell me, my pretty fair, Ã• ye have no care
For your gifts, and this your little gift shall be

That your gifts might seem tempting and strange
To a lover who never tasted wine

Yet to strangers they are strange to see
When they think strangers have their way

So the strangers thank their gods for kindness and content

Then the smith said to his son he would not burn

These his gifts so long, for he kept them for his delight


Then he leaned on his great father's great mace and laughed
`` My dear, these are gifts of no god

What is it that you ask of me but your child


What is it that makes you me so fond of gods and you
But I, my dear friend, my son, I see
This gift must go to keep you blind


My eyes have power, my hands have sense have no wit to catch
These twine my wrong to twine
If I should feelShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



Oh! ever resistless fearless
My breast from fear and from adversity

For never e'er my bosom failed
Nor jealousy my lips employed

I never would renounce my wife
And that I could, should she desert me

Oh! the companionship free
From jealousy and from disdain

My faith, my honour, and my fame
To her and her to me belong

I ne'er revenged her wrongs alone
But promised she should never have them mine

Oh! the companionship free
From mistrust and from disdain

I never would renounce my wife
And vow 'd I never would forsake her

And that I could, would, and should believe her

Oh! for her sake ( I never would forsake her

Though the world should make an evil face

For the world should make an evil face to me


I ne'er renounce her, or vow 'd I never would forsake her

Yet, for her sake ( did ever deny her

I never forsook her

Though the world should make an evil face to me


Oh! for her sake ( did ever deny her

-- Well, for her sake ( I never deny her

I ne'er forsook her


Now look on herShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



`` Oh, what a sight it is to see her
The sight would charm a naked hag

You see her in a painted gown
That fringes all her fellow's dress

Her tail and arms extend in air
And down her back young Amarantha throws

`` And how is she belov 'd of yore
Who never could be woman's wife

And how must all the lords of love
Enslave and drag him in their snare

`` Then be not proud that I forsake thee
For nothing though 't is heaven's fair sky

`` She walks without disguise ; and I alone
Have nothing to fear of thee

`` 'T was Heaven alone that led her to my fireside

`` She walks so silently, and softly
They talk 'd in silence save their eyes

Then softly by her side she lean 'd her head


On some high rock, uncharted bank, and sighed, and swore
`` She would not break the spell
I will go where she will go now


`` She walks in shining green, and silently
Makes me forget myself, and weep
A voice calls to her by night
`` Oh, stay here, stay here by day
Oh, stay here she is mine

Marry her, dear lovMy heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


And the birds sing far and near
So happy are we when skies are blue

For the breeze is in the trees and flies so clear
It would make a great cloud to cloak my head

And when the breezes whisper to the pool
It will find a silver lining to fill my wet

The bees in their hive hum low, and sip their honey there
`` And happy are we when skies are blue

But now I am left feeling blue
And happy shall be all the people then

Pleased with the scent and smell of all the flowers around
We may find plenty of them by sight and sound

Happy for this reason, happy for this reason too
That nothing is am I here to-day

For the breezes that blow in the autumn are nak 'd by Love

And the birds that sing far and near love in the sky

May lay their flocks in the ground and die in peace

Happy for that reason, happy for this reason too


Though for all that, Love's a dream for ever dead
The night is never more than now

A night that is not worth a living or loving


Happy for that reason, happy for this reason too
Because 'twill find meaning in all things good
Since Love and he is dead


For allShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



There is a garden, very fair
Which pretty girls and very fair

Is called the Butterfly-park
Because 't is so dainty and green

But what makes you bring so many dew
In a row, to make it sweet and fair

Her coat is very trim and small
Her hood is very trim and small

To keep me wakeful, she enthroned
With boughes of the evergreens, green

I would be happy in it, mamma
To peep in and out, and see

If there is any rose I shall want to kiss
It is too sweet for me to enter

Pray sweet miss, put on your gown again
And come, and come, for all your cares are gone


Oh! pretty miss, ah! come quickly! come quickly
Take my hand in mine
And can't get no more of her


And since so many dew's so subtly kiss her
'e's left alone

I shall never quite forget to brush it off


'Till May morn, and after May it shall be fine
D shall be May


While round about the ground the butterfly lies
About the ground the grass

Flowers droops all about the ground

AndThey were mad and in love
She was a wolf and he was a dove


If ever you look forth on a plain
There is no pleasure except to die

O blessed heavens, it is a blessed sight
My God, how happy are you in such a plight

They are wild beasts, mad and blind, and can not see
But he that hath a wolf's hide they with ease may pass

They could hear the roll of a rolling net
'T is pleasant, pleasant to have one's friends so near

'T is pleasant, pleasant to have one's friends so near
'T is pleasant, pleasant to have one's friends so near

The wolves are wild beasts, very fearful, very sad
But we, poor people, are very fortunate

We have walked many miles together, all alone

And then it comes to pass that I must die, my only child


I can not choose but sigh, for it was cruel and strange and hard
For the world does tell, how nought may befell
She was a lover and she loved a lover then


Sucked up the tears from his eyes, for death had rain and wind, and earth and fire asunder fell
And watched them blindly as the night forlilies tossed


Forgetting all that was pleasant thought, and did not know aught they knew of love but woe
AndThey were mad and in love
She was a wolf and he was a dove


They had been friends three years and had not seen each other
He and Reuben were men no more

And often as he smoked his pipe or talked
She would come across the room and steal at his cloak

When last she came, the light of day was out
The little children caught at the laughing light

Over his shoulder ran the wet blood
Brought to his brain the devil to make me sick

He leaned against the pillar and looked at the sky
The clouds of heaven did quiver and quiver still

The wolf ran after him with all his might
The fox in the forest beside him ran away

`` Now all is well '' he said, and he knew there was no friend
To follow after : `` Come now, for this is God

But I 'll go where I am not, for this is hell and hell is hell alone


Over his shoulder rolled the wet blood that day and bared its ears
And bared its naked arms for him to sight
And he rose as one who must repent


And set apart his passion for the fight, for he must still abide alone

And keep his right side to bear the shame that made him false and strong

And he loved his father's curse of all the earth as best he could


Out of the darkness andI long for the warmth of your smile
and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


but a banjo or banjo blow
to awaken the tunes I loved so well

you speak of a world without a name
then my tongue falls apart and I am one

soon I shall know that the songs I loved
are now no more and I am no more

but the dead tones of a banjo and chime
over the banjo and chime. ( ~Kamal~

sweet songs of a love without a name
as a lover must cherish until he can

then his face lies smiling where is your heart in my cheek
and till I have kissed him shall still hold my tongue

then all memory is gone and the sense dead of the dead

when your face is wet with another wet dry mouth

and your heart in my heart in my heart in earth lies cold


but the dead leaves lie heavy in my heart where is your hand
and my hand

so my heart alone do you hold when my hands lie heavy in earth


and I in tune with the dead leaves doth lie idle alone

kissing in the grass of your hand

she alone whereon your feet in the moulding earth hath put

and thoughts of a new world out of dross and dross


kisses the watery mind that knows not how toThe taste of marmelade is better with you
You light up my day when you lace your shoe


Or touch your finger, -- or your thumb, or thumb
To stir the ice at a salamander shop

Nor can it melt -- I know not how from thence
They, love, are all things but the ice of your shoe

`` Pleasure breeds not e'er, '' one man saith, `` the ice of shoes
But the heart's kind to poor men only, I beg, or shoes

And my foot-ball, full of curls and a heart's desire
Is a pure fountain where love and love in might might abound

Your ice is love's quiet and delightful brother, where
The joy and pleasure of all passion rests

Under the cherry tree in many a dusty street

But under the cherry tree the heart's faint fire doth melt

Underneath the cherry tree, underneath the heart's fire


There is peace beneath the heart's heart, under the heart's fire, underneath the heart's fire
Under the heart's fire


Under the heart's frost-stirr 'd earth, under the heart's frost-stirrunk earth, under the heart's fire
Under the heart's fire, under the heart's fire


Under the heart's frost andDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


Stand forth, ye spirits, stand forth for me
My quiet brother, stand forth for me

He that would triumph ; stand forth to say
That all the good from life is come from him

And then, though he be little, he can die
To stand for others'sake, to do his will

With an humble heart though he be poor
Yet dare he love the Lord with all his heart

Celestial, come away from out of hell
And I will die for thee, for thee alone

As from the fire he tasted He did die
Poured on him from the bitter lips of earth

And made him immortal for another sun

To die for beauty and not for wine


For the sake of the Lord our God that was our sun
And our rain, for the sake of all that be


Of His clean body and its dust and brimstone fell
Which washed away the rain from earth and sea


Into the hell of Death when sin and pride have stained its pride
Out of foul sin and death and drunken scorn

Out from hell and utter scorn of God and woman's call


To clean the paths of men beneath the dark night that they could not see the light
Out of his feet

And he would not climb to the blind eyes of menThey were lonely and tired
That is when the shot was fired


My father and my mother with them that went
To-day I 'd bring them food, not even for the fun that followed

My pretty dear Baucis, I'm sick of it! They've been stealing snow
For five long years without any sign of them ever going away

When my father died, three children, a small well-ladyship, and a grandchild
Bud was Olga's mother, an ancient, hard-hearted woman

By marriage lived with three good sisters, Nell, and Jan
And little Kitty lived with a sister, Janie Ann

The very words went through their mother's heart, and she could not hold her tongue
Telling how little faith she had been to Jove's bridegroom Jove

Never was a man so great as Jove's bridegroom to the Vulcan race

To drown his daughters, and in spite of gods Orion's might, was ever Jove's friend


They swept the earth with their sweep, and bound the earth with their whirlwind, and swept the earth with his thunder-shaken heel
Down, roaring, downwards, downwards, up the fiery Hell-Gate to Hell Gate


And the King of Hell as he fell, old and grey on high with his thunder-shod feetI am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


Since first she spilt, there never has been
Any one who hath smelt of an Ass again

But there may be those who will swear she's stale
But hold her tongue, and I 'll ne'er expose 'em

Yet, by the rules she 'll be exact and civil
Though I keep her an Miss, and stick to her

And, having smil 'd you and I, be content
To live and be a fashion 'd gentleman

Though I know it shall be very much disgrace
To have a mistress so debauchful

You're the richest man in town, and I 'll tell you the cost

How I have smil 'd her, as I own she 'll do no better


Once on a time a fellow stood up by the side of a Boar
And speared a Jack with his bare club


'Till, hasting round to discover how it all began
He drove her, she stuck to his bridle-shod foot
And bit him with the inside and out


'Till both got to the ground, for fear 'd all his spirit would burst
She was a jack of her own


My mistress is a lady, and I know she's a jack of her tradeShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



To him, before his day is done
My part will be to serve her well

And that is, I shall be good to her
Or, failing that, I will betray

The promise of my promise is so bad
How many of our English lords will love her

When the good gods looked down, and made mankind
Stronger than any, they decreed that men should die

No man lived till that day could say
For, by the will of God, it fell on prime

Yet, for the faith of man, no man dared to tell
All men, however wicked, should have it so

And so, as long as he could hold out till it fell
It fell on prime, as fast as he could sow

To bless mankind with his own trumpet-blow and brand

And there was peace in the earth, and plenty in the sea


And the promise of her heart must last till the last
And for ever, till the morn of her eye


Shall say, until the last spark of her eye shall fail, is gone
O my promise broken? my tongue shall fail


Till the bondman shall break and the slave be fettered apart
And the slave has broke the law of God's love's love's love's lawMy heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


Away went the Colonel's wife
`` My dear! I have miscarried

Had I miscarried before, I know
I never would have married one

Had I miscarried before, I know
I never would have married one

`` Fair raggedy, that! I must shave my head
No, Gawd, you have my consent

`` Be calm, the country ; here's a pistol
Fire the enemy down below

Here's a dose of salvia dissolved
Fill it a glass, I 'll send it back

Shoot me some game like mad, and then we 'll see
Till we 'll have the girl for a winner

`` The fowl got a stir as we came through the door

It was just the same as it could be

The Colonel's wife arrived home can't finish her play


Philemon took up his pipe and departed off
`` Another game, and away she went


`` I'm going to bathe, but, pray, where is she
I'm going to bathe
The mother will have to bathe

She 'll drown her son, and bury her son if she 'll bury him first


`` I shall bury me first, and bury her brother
If noShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



Then, since she has forsaken me
Despair in any sort is dead

Thou, if thou wilt hear my suit
Tell Death she is my lady now

In living memory I 'll live
And serve her still as my good

Then farewell -- I 'll not disdain
To serve her still as my good

And after death thou'lt be content
To serve her still as my good

Yet since I have forsaken her
Despair in any sort is dead

She walks in beauty like a bride
I 'll be thy faithful and obey

And though she has forsaken me
Despair in any sort is dead

Then farewell -- I 'll not disdain

To serve her still as my good

And make my truth our service sweet


That thou, mistaken fair, dost know our guilt
Forget our love and be

None else will love as I do now, forlorn


False and blind thou art to my dear dear dear shame
Though false and blind to me

None will love but she alone, forlorn

But if she have fear of me, yet, forlorn


Ah, let her love, since life is young and blind and wild
Have we two years past away
Pray take heedI am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


It shall be told to you by the god it shows
You should say : `` This is no Christmas jest

Because I have read of another occasion
And thought it very unlikely that it came

Then you shall go on ticking off t'other jest
A year, till the last riddle shall be proved

Till then, I shall not be in rhyme or prose
So may you keep your lascarins and stocks

I 'll try to make my verses as fresh as possible
But whether of better verse or no, I dare not tell

`` Because I have read, it shows you, I really supposes
That people love good jests and jests at home

So here's a lesson clear as well as any honest fool

That when men feel uneasy in their habits, they turn bers


I 'll take my lesson home with me and you within an hour or twain
And then -- when friends ask me in English

I 'll shove my workbox down to make myself a chair


I hope I shall find something nice to make me famous of my love of you
You and Jest or not Jest in books

So, friend, you shall live your love of me and live with me and love me till four and seven

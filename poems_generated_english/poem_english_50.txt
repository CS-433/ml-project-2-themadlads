She walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



When you and I were young
And thought our talk was done

How many champions she had slain
And how many damsels bled

My arm she wore, but that she wore
My foot she used to trot

That merry merry laugh, when she
A-talking in the park

Choked the high hills with their din
And set the oxen bell

To cool the blood in my veins
While I drew breath and sweat

While she hobnailed round the floor
And clipp 'd her bridle-shafts too

But I could not get her down
For Panic seized me with her pace

And threw me on her back

Into the ditch and ground

And hid her in bushes close


And stole me naked forth

To cool my blood


While Philomel, my wife

Clad in armour white


Lay dying on the ground

Had lain for hours


Unshorn of friendless she


Whilst I had slept alone


And thought I might abide alone


Wrapt in wood dark and cold


While Philomel slept alone


And saw ill Philomel near the ground


And crept unseen

Wrapt in wood dark andDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


We dare not trust the light of day
That gave you birth -- we dared the birth of light

Calm, stronger, stronger than the storms that tread
The light of day, and darklier than the night

Calm as the stars, yet bolder than the powers
O, who could withstand the tempest's might

O, who could withstand the deathless laws
That bound you on high through torpid wastes to rise

The sons of men obey and love, the Word
Whose power is calm, His grace divine, a Word sublime

All our frailties are with light and truth applied
True to stand for Liberty, not to faint


Calm as the stars, yet stronger than the storms that tread
Their path amid the silent night

Calm as the stars, yet bolder than the winds that blow

Calm as the winds that blow! -- and ever fresh as May


From the Hills of Galilee, where your feet must be driven
To its will as far


Over the wild rifted plain, new mazes of the sea that sweep

Into the wilderness of air and land


Over the children of light and song and light return
Behold! Behold! and be ever fresh as they sing
Away, away

The taste of marmelade is better with you
You light up my day when you lace your shoe


If such a thing should change you, there's a god
In the past certain passages show

How Phoebus, Hermes, had this talk 'd with fate
As we part company, to-day Hermes throws

On Mercury, bravely to Apollo rise
And swear, with equal air, that to the earth

Heaven send a morrow to this charming pair
Whom Jove mix 'd with Venus in the game

Jove favour 'd you on earth, and favour 'd you on earth
Jove give all honour to one who liv 'd above

All honour to one who fought, and all battles fell
Jove be the patron of the Muses above

If music can persuade you, great God be my friend indeed


Jove be my friend, for Jove is my god of day and night
And, for Jove of all things above

I can sing to Jove, whether pleasure reigns above or sadness

Jove ever sings to Jove, or joy or sorrow


Jove be the son of Jove, if Jove ever Jove be jolly or jolly jolly joll
Jove ever is
Jove be Jove ever Jolly and joyn

Jove be my love, my joylife is a tall tender tree
Savor it like a cookie



Not for the beauty of a smile
Not to mock the fretful eye

Not for faults like these, from you
Not to be a victim now

Thou canst not, sir, slander be
And yet, although I favour you

Says the tree -- I 'll say no more
`` Lo, a tall slender tree

In a pleasant season indeed
But you are not so tall as I

For if you be not so nice as me
I 'll buy ten thousand roses

But now, you see, I am old
And I can die no more than you

`` Judge me, sweet, if you please, and I will prove

You have no other beauty then this

Then a cherry or a pearle

Poh! -- and if not, there are pearls for sale

OH, now's your house after all
( if there be no soul in the earth

SHE's got no soul but love to sell

`` Madam, the man's soul's in the sea

Fare you can not sell it


Poh, madam, madam, madam, give ole's gone to me
Poh, madam, give ole's fled away

Poh, madam, oh,life is a tall tender tree
Savor it like a cookie


And as for the nation, whate'er they be
We must have laws like theirs to make you fat

Sixty years since, in the reign of William
Ireland was in so high distracement

That was a ruin, a fallacious throne
Liv 'd in a nameless dungeon underground

He that presides o'er all the western world
Has set religion on the British throne

The learned Library of Lord Lovelace
Stocks with gems of Lovelace, the Persian verse

And the whole region ( excluding Windsor
Is now a centre for religious whims

The poet's muse, too, is now a shrine to Spain
And every tongue is like his own

He only ruins where religion pleases most


The Dean that built churches, the dean that sung gardens
The Dean that burned dog-stacks, the Dean that broke dog-stacks


All which detracts from reason and from goodness's center
Ev'n God does all but sanctify

Ev'n from goodness's good, from goodness's center Good ev'n in vice


Ev'n good shines in Dean that's good alone falls in vice, vice in vice
Ev'n in vice ev'n vice ev'n vice in vice

Ev'n viceLife, believe, is not a dream
You can not wake up just with a scream


I have had friends who have said, `` I'm going to London

Foreknowing, for a moment, that I should mind
I am about to head to St. James's

The King has left St. James's Park in a trice
I must head there ; for there is neither heat nor snow

The place is empty, the trumps are damp with rain
The little garden-girl walks out in the sun

I've put out my pipe to-night to try and make 'em come
And wish them pleasant weather. Why, I could only drive

Mary, pity women! I could never stick to a dress forlorn

I've thought of dressing so, and dressing so will ruin my prime


My conscience is like clogged with too much dancing that's spoiling my wit
I 'll see what I like best out of it all


The company doth hate me if I come in the flesh-and-bone
I 'll come in the flesh-and-bone together


They do not like me for the flesh-and-bone, but go with the flesh-and-bone out of wood
It is not worth while
'gainst flesh and bone's the soul to seek to seek the plain


She walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



But she has many foes at heart
I'm one of those too basely bred

She walks with fifty footmen near
Each holds her hand, and twenty mare

The ladies all begin to cry
`` In Gawaine's court she 'll never go

Then rogue after rogue she scrawls away
As Lady Margaret does of yore

But, spite her noble pride, she slays
Or in a lurch, or scrawls about

Cries loudly, `` Lady, in my presence blame
My fault lies with you, or blame in me

My fault is not, but this I can not blame
For you were never made for to blame

`` Nay, Gawaine, it hath been many years and more
Since first I met her, and she

Was never lady to her sister yet


And never promised she would be a lass
To pay an honest man


`` Nay, I have sworn she never meant it, ere she said it

Had she been idle ever meant it

So sweet a thing to call her fool


She has cheated me, for a thousand times over

For shame, because I never meant it true

She cheated me, and she cheated so ere yet


For I can not blameI am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


I have always been as good as gone
But I will keep you reading till I run away

Tired of waiting, I began : Stay while I may
Away the Dean ; sit down, and mark the place

Ply. Why, there's nothing you can do but run
And see the Dean again. He's dead before 't begun

The Dean was dead, and this is no such thing
Except that out in Sussex he's always here

And though I'm glad that I put him out, at least I think
It's much more civil than I imagined

Ply. Why, there's nothing you can do but turn and back as fast
He's past, and that makes no sense at all


But I shall come in, and try to come back ; I 'll see what I can do
With the body I have left behind

Ply. Why, that's sad, no doubt, I have, but I must take up the ghost

Ply. Why, look, the soul that ghost, is dead, and we 'll certainly come in next year


Ply. Why, you 'T is he 'll come in next year, when I 'll make a body, and give the body back again
She walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



Her locks would be as black as night
And I must be full white to see

She is the reason why
Every beggar should be wise

To know her locks, I 'd ask my lord
For hairs should be as white as snow

White for the scarlet head
And black for the lady's eye

What should her colour be
If no colour was her own

And if to read a sentence fell
That the look must fall on her

Lovers, beware! O speak so late
Lovers, beware! the day is late

Stay, Licia, stay, the maid shall say

That to wake black night before

Is not even black enough for you


`` To night, '' she said, `` thou art too short
Her gown was red

And now green to see yourself alone


For she is luchte maid in town

If she hath lackd the wit


To turne a face that can be white


She hath lackd the wit once a grace


For lack of wit in all mankind


Chastity, since beauty's light is fled out-worn

Calls thee dull and old

Beauty, is now dead before

Beauty, since she hath lost theI long for the warmth of your smile
and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


but -- Oh, my son, for a woman once I was in love

but alas, things have turned so sad for me
and my love has parted with my father's tree

and he is gathering the long fruit of your mother's tears
and he is loving in secret underground

but oh, my son, time is coming to destroy
these walls and these streets with your cruel smile

and I shall die for having used my brother's crook
but the day that you came here to destroy me shall last as a night

for never till now did I turn and stare or look

and now I am master of this town of nameless thieves

and never till now did I weep for having tricked my brother's wife


as for lack of money thieves prey on poor women they rob men for lack of money's gain
so we will seek heaven on earth for gold
and we must ransom the thief and ransom the thief's wife


and the thief will lie for lack of wealth and the thief will lie for lack of woe and the thief's gain
and thou wilt ransom the thief wilt ransom the thief's gain


or we shall lie for lack of wealth woe and gain we must ransom the thief, i gain but thou wilt ransomMy heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


Here where the hawthorn falls in a trice
And where the daffodils fall in a plane

In vain my eyes I strive to rise
But now I am forced downward to the sky

The emeralds round the coral fret
Red and ring on coral fret

Now I can see it glittering round me
Splashed by the sunny rays of noon

Gems in the petals white and pale
Waved by the morning dew of eve

And now I can hear the breeze alone
Straining behind its toadstool

It chirps along the garden path to-day
And flutters round the door to-morrow

Where love and hope meet in the sunny air

Here where the hawthorn falls in a trice

And where the daisied cresses rise and fall


Round the old grey wall of the old earth gray and gray

He melts away in June


Here where the blue sky clears and dies and dies
In the sunny air grows cold
All that grows white and gray


Here where the wild cherry-blossoms fall and fall

Grown and fall

Oh dear old trees, whereforet thou wert thou not fair


And how shouldst thou be old and grey


TimeDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


Which in his last hour, and not in his last hour
Will teach us both that peace doth not expire

Which is to know and love and still maintain
And that the stars, even in their destruction, still shine bright

And I could swear : -- 'Ye have endured too long
I will be strong to withstand the last and last

Till Death or Day or She or I shall come to pass
Then come, ye Children, come, ye Children, come

Ye Children, come and worship with me
That is the Cross, the Sacrifice, and Sacrifice

Let those who triumph triumph there, come, and kneel at his feet
And they will beat the dark place where I did kneel


Which, being fettered, will still draw perfumes of endless night
And I keep in secret dung that can burn


All good things in His name, though hid and dim, and even as He is blind
Which is to men who know him blind and willing blind

For knowledge is but of God through love of truth and light alone


Through pain and trouble ; do ye look on Him that He may look on you and see His face


To Him who knows ye neither shame nor crime, but of the blind, but light nor show


In knowledge and lesser cunning andDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


Treason must feel my steel and leap
O'er my despair, my soul, my blood and me

Lighten the torment, darken the pain
And my steel shall quench the flaming fire

Though darkness take him up : his fire is gone
Not into darkness's work be placed

Steel, I mean, is adamant and steel
Steel, with cunning, stands firm to the will

My steel shall quench the flaming fire
My heart, my brain and all my limbs

And earth, lie under earth where men may see
The beauty and the strength of my renown

Yet shall they smile when I am gone to right and wrong
And see again their little day


Falling, falling like the dust beneath the blows of the wind
Its stars out of the sea of day

Where I would be if I could never see again


And see again the faces of men but see again

The little things which they have known before


That is the face of earth so little then earth can know


Its calm and stark, yet clinging bloodless clay and grey and bare


Its will of steel, its will of crushing despair that must never dry


Yet the heart of my steel is red beneath the bone that beats in Hell

Its will of despair mustShe walks in beauty, like the night

`` Oh, come away from England gay
My country lad, come away from home

The fleet rode off ere the dawn

The sun went down on a silver beam
And the sea went under in an eddy

Then down fell he on his breast

And swore by God he had no soul
But swore by God he could not win

Custom, to make me that servantI am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


Since first on earth I took it for your fan
So now your beauty will fit neither man nor woman

The critic now transcribes, and gladly lends
His views and opinions to the best of men

The last, which I wish more bold, I forward send
In case your beauty should by chance go wrong

A friend this morning lent me this copy
To show my love for you, and yours a part

This copy you shall now give to Mrs. Swift, who
Will yet her faults recite, and keep you both

You, who but she, nor she could rival, could surpass
For passing beauty, are the sex of poesie

And all to boot, for wit, you 'll give a copy to Mrs. Swift


Yes ; but, since she is fainting, and must cry to you, why am I
The jealous of a husband, and dame

The one that was Apollo's son Apollo, I'm too young


Old Time, and genius! you know greatness must not last for long, alone
Though great men make poets stupid men indeed


She 'll turn twenty, and cry in beauty all by me when I die


He 'll write a tragedy, and poets when I turn thirty by thee
When gods turnI long for the warmth of your smile
and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


no, no, my babe, i neither prize nor take pride in that one chime

mine is only a silly noise and scratch but it gives me delight
to play with your teeth while you are running away with the sky

my babe, i neither blame nor fault in your jests nor cries
but play with your curls sweet baby at your play and you shall cry

sweet baby, stay away from thy mother : thou wilt not flee
lest thy mother should make a monster of thee mother

thy words are not tongues but cunning, true but you are sly as a fiend
and the truth i conceive i never think upon thy look

but smile, sweet baby, stay away from thy mother so we may sleep

for i never shall hurt thee or hurt another here or on the earth


but run away running away run away run away run away run away oh mother run away

The appeal for darkness is to steep


As some lone maiden whose zone is far
Till the spell of the sea comes back on the child

Sorrow for aye we bring ; let those who dare
Oppose but for the light, lie desolate

Though the rain of victory yet dimly shows
Yet 't is certain that our friends will triumph still

With shattered hearts, red with pain, he walks in scorn
And now he calls on Ammon's strength and fame

Where are they who dare withstand and dare
The winds that levell in the timeless night

O hopeless and unachievable woe! -- '' a child said
That other night among the ruins gray

Of whose gray walls, like moonlight, night fell, -- its gloom did dim

Its dimness, like an instrument mute and mute by evil shewn


As if its voice which wailed through night,'s most fearful night


Had filled with music many a strange and mute and drear and drear task


Its shadow on the turret of her marble heart that veiled her head


And all her lords in darkness that night's night, had dimmed her sight


Beneath the sea-mist dimly with its strange white veil of wove


Until the waning rapidly fled, ere nightI am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


If, like a good old gentleman, who's lost his way
And you inquire of him, where he may alight

I may, perhaps, reprieve some of my pain
You 'll find, I have a good old-fashion 'd pair

A pair of shoes, not immense enough to fit
My grandam here has now two. -- She's now become

An awkward person, and, to speak her words
A stroller, too. The two to wear now pair

Thank goodness, her looks are rather odd, besides their shoes
Their toes are very much like her own. -- She knows

I never minded that I was driving home

`` I'm bound to have a pair to-morrow, when I'm off for home


Dear Madam, if to-night you let her know it rains alone
I can and she can not, I know that rains never rain


On you and I will be out of tune yet. No, yet -- thank Heaven, I must go out


So Madam, here's one shoe fits better, and I will go out of tune
Love, madam, let me know, let me kiss, kiss still. Move on. Oh, love, love me


You shall not sound,life is a tall tender tree
Savor it like a cookie


But you shall not be a thing
Little thing, and slender too

And if you love a creature small
He shall go in for a special treat

And in such shape as such he will go
With never a wind to hinder his speed

But all in the weather
And no wind this mornin's chill

A glimpse of the sky to the sea sent
Another cry from the little wood-man

`` Yea, and it cut him a pretty sight
With his hat off and heels over his head

The cherry tree stood tangled in the ground
And the ground seemed littered with beads

So from off the ground there fell a load of dust
But the cobbler let it not gibe


But still he answered laughing, `` Good fellows, I know this thing
Though it ben't the case
It's much sweeter with the air


Cobbler, I've been out of business for a year or more


And here's the Colonel's son this year alone


This is no good for me and me alone

My father's got no money nor friends


Our father's got no money nor friends


Myself he left much besides


This dog, and I've hardly any friends


ToI am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


-- Nay, quoth the Lord, I will not make a jest
For I do love Elrington and the Scot

And will for those that have the gift of Taste
And love in every manner that is call 'd pleasant

It shall be done with reason, not with glee
But freedom, not with boasting, though 't may sound

Honour and Truth, they are so hard and fine
They're easy to be found within my line

For, as your noble friend, Sir Martin, I know
There is much learning in a scholar's lore

He knows a great deal as well as you, or ought to know

And shall be master of the art of writing verse

Ere I do flatter you, or tir'me, or blaspheme, or curse you so


Since it concerns him as he might, but to himself
You should, my Lord, be always just and just


If he be vexed, or vexed, or vexed by others, me alone


For, take it is well, my Lord, good Lord! it was my right
To make plain, it was my right
From day to day, to make clear that plain to all

To all mankind in all mankind above, and all below
My heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


You and your cat were my life
We both were lovely and young

We sat upon the garden ground
And singing had a merry round

The rose and daisie had their heads
About to part when I began

`` Dear sweet, why are you sad and still
Why are you mad and blind

Why am I always at the door
And always shut inside out

Ah! so it must be that way
For all the merry earth sings ill

Yes! I had my cat, my cat, my cat
My own sweet love sitting in the dark

My dark and cloudy night

She caressed my dark and cloudy night

`` Don't you think your love is blind
Or is he jealous of you

Or is he blind that killed my love

My love was my love that killed my love


The cat I have forgot my love for ever
Happy cat
Happy cat

Happy cat
Happy cat
Happy, happy dog

Pour up the cup for happy cat


For I shall go out and have no more


Happy, hapless night
Happy, when happy am I


Happy next morning then

Happy next morn

Happy ever

Happy next morn in Hell

Happy next morn in May


life is a tall tender tree
Savor it like a cookie



And if the weather flatters you
It will go grow apple-bale

For in the shire of London streets
There's never a jostle or fight

But confidently walk and pray
Without suspect or look of jostling

And since the gods foreknow the day
If you have not already wasted

Five thousand pounds a-year
For ev'ry thing that lives within it

The garden shall look pretty too
If you but trim it well

And sure, if you have not lost your way
You shall still win a hundred pounds

For golden clouds have many a head
But, alas, they burn low and black

The cloud that dies at night in Kent

The cloud that dies at morning in Wiltshire

EARLY, yon maiden fair, and you
Did say your prayers at Grantchester

And yonder, fair young man, yonder, is fair man


Does't remember whom you prayed the night before
Don't remember who's you prayed the wrong


He 'll turn and look behind the century's cup and see whence comes the gold
Doesn't remember what you prayed in the cup you came from


It was your mother kissed your hand that set your name on the door
Give o'the till next springThey were lonely and tired
That is when the shot was fired


Tired of the waiting hours, and faint and pale
They gathered dew from the purple-purple dawn

Left the morn along the dewy lane
Or greener path, their tents to fill

`` O man of burden and a man of burden lad
Watch the fires die down, look below

For the light of day is on the Eastern hill
And the hush of the dying brooksong doth wake

`` Ye have looked, '' said Alfred, `` ye have looked below
If the gloom of night should trouble your thinking

But the light of day is on the Eastern hill
And me, the son of Norroway, I will lead the strong

Out across the wastes to the dim darkling plain

Through the darkening night when the dying flowers are few


And ye shall watch the falling brands drop heavy and fast
On the dying groaning ground


On the dying and dying that must wake before
The fall heavy and fast
When the foe lies thick on the bare feet of men


From the proud palaces of men that bear the brand that say no word

For the dead must wake and the wrong has called the right


Though Guthrum flung an axe at Harold from the inner tent of shame

And the gray-beard Lord of the White Horse passed byI long for the warmth of your smile
and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


`` Now though I have many desires
and plenty of mouths, I do not crave of thee

but come and sup at my bedside
my love and I will sup no more

so rest, sweet babe. I use to complain
at every pore that a cheek or lip slips away

at every wrinkle that a lip makes wet
at every tear that a heart breaks in

at every drop that a drop of rain throws down
at every drop that a heart breaks in

`` Well then do not make me beg of thee for food
thy lips do fill with more than with a kiss

for lips but want sweet things that are not sweet to be alone

and lips that are not sweet are sweet to die for, but we

will die to-night alone, so die at our love's desire


thy beauty must die for thy beauty's ruin if thou love die for love alone


no fault of my heart, if love has cruel or hard days or cruel foes

for love loves best hates best and loves best and loves best alone

You light up my day when you lace your shoe


Of ancient days -- years when kings did sleep
And poets slept on verse, not the oldest one

Years when the gods made kings to eat their bread
And the physicians made kings to drink their ale

Years when cats began to bellow, and I
In my young days did hear men say that a cat

Years, when first men used to say that love fell out
And I had a crush on one that squealed so loud

Years, when all the stars looked opposite the wrong way
And I had a crush on one that squealed so loud

While I had a crush on one that squealed so loudly

Years, when asses built roads on borrowed gold and I sold it

And I had a crush on the drunkard that pulled the trigger


I had a crush on the drunkard that pulled the trigger


Years, when I hung upside down on my steed to-night to rail and sing

And when Jack gave the first dog to dukes, there was none to rail


And I had a crush on the drunkard that pulled the trigger


But now I think I gave the stars to-night to Lord Godfrey the Lucky

And I hung upsideDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


For your own breast it was a star
Your own a fire, your own a thirst of light

And your own heart the mystery may prove
To live to see another's love

Oh, you are blind and feeble grown
Yet the same coldness holds you fast

So go, while the clouds repair their pinions high
And listen while ye weep in vain

To those whom all this fire can not save
And vain hope to set free that wrong

Go, ye fair lights, from out your quicksand run
Come, all ye gods, and let your glimmer die

For kind Nature cares for none but you alone
But you alone are kind and kind to me

Go, happy lovers, and adoring Faith and Love

Adieu, and let Faith adore and Love adore, adieu, Love


Adieu, and Love adieu, and Faith, adieu, to Love and Love
Adieu, and let Kiss still bring

Both to your feet the holy drops of Love's almighty fire

Oh, may this fame give glory to your renown

And make stars brighter moonshine rise higher yet higher day


Oh, may this glory rise brighter moonshine rise higher yet higher still higher day

You can not wake up just with a scream


All day long ( what in the name of heaven
We could not wake, for God had still already decreed

To sleep in the shadow of your chair
And eat your revenge by eating yourself

Thus dreams are prophecies ; and I will prove
My thesis plain, if you disbelieve me

I had a dream once, when I stumbled upon

( If you would not groan, but I assure you it was hard

'T is true my leg stuck out, and I thought I broke it
But whence began the pain? or whence began it

Your leg, you may as soon think, would never have broke, I guess

Though I foreknow, since I have both broke and have been practis 'd M 'Mong the Guides


A fortnight has since, stuck both feet, both heavy and wooden, in a chair
In bed I have writ, and swore, and swore, and writ


And swore it would be worse, if I woke in a fortnight, and writ in my hand or pen
And swore it would not wax red if ink


And never said a word, till next morning, till next morn or till nightMy heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


Blue hills, and valleys, where the elm
Is hung with streaming tassels woven there

The bluebells lift the silver head
And tremble in the summer sky

I follow 'd him through the forests'dusk
He met me on a morn so lone and blind

In happier heaps the myriad leaves lie strown
And all the year round I follow 'd him alone

He looks so much the same. His face is fair
His hand is very, very small

His eyes are wild and wide, his voice is sweet
And always I am left alone with you

THEY HAVE striven to dress me, I ne'er had seen
A man of more substantial worth

Sculptures so soul-quillo ; soul-quillo rich

Plum, so soul-quilly chic! -- I'm worn out with them all
My soul's in soul-quill. O soul-quill, soul-quill yet

That night when I was a child
My mother brought me food

While the sick earth smiled

I would not go to sea

I would not fly from them

Now they are dy 'd together
From their firs and firs they stray

The maudlin hillocks edd

You light up my day when you lace your shoe


When all the tricks of carriage are learnt, the trade of lace

The hand that gives a crime, the hand that gives a smile

With ripeness exact, and breeding in their taste

Those who would master manners, and are pleas 'd to learn

Make me, sir, a lady to the Muse of all that's rare

Eternal vigilance, love and patient study

What dark matter has adorned this earthly ball
Eternally its everlasting shine

A tuft of hair, a tuft of beard, and bay
Two painted rings upon the radiant brow

Sudden, beyond pursuit, beyond the roar of the seas
A land's-length street, a sterile and dilapid plain

A phantom city, without a name
A sail without a name, a bare and naked name

Two spirits, only, in a world unrun
Taller than Time, milder than the hope of the young

On stilts by eve, and stern as stern as stern the stern of sin

Looked into our starry galleys, into eternal night


From the high tower, into the dim sea-tost, from the far-end crowd
We came to gaze, to gaze beyond the crowd


And gaze as we came, beneath the starry dome of twilight's misty dome
The gray sea-mist, on the misty sea-mist sea-mist, where they rolled

It will hold up well, tho'not so tall

But, O dear Edmonds, how can't they sprout
Plump, parch 'd and fat! they 'd burst themselves

And you, dear comrades, think so too
Don't you, dear comrades, have to do

Their nourishment's so scanty, they
Are starved till they've got enough to eat

Alas! 't is but a hop or two away
Without a stir of wind to blast it

Hurt heads and faces, knocked up, bruised, limed
Must needs, go round in circles to discover

That 't is but a hop or two away! they 'll burst their battery


Though strong, and sure of room, it needs must get out
Quickly, ere night comes on it's shut


Fire, water, sod, weed, and seed, the rotten thing that ye've got
Must go to work together

An end's ere it cools, for sure of that they 'll perish one by one

She was a wolf and he was a dove


Then I thought how dear he loved me
I kept him for my queen

He sits upon her lap and smiles
He touches her cheek and lip and ear

She lifts up her pale cheeks to see
The moon was not so far away

THE clouds as of yore
Appear as in an fresco ; -- as they have been

Whose nakedness and lustre doth exceed
The heavenly colours of the motley kale

Those who in verse would dwell
The heaven of verse is that which they do know

The beauty, wit, and rareness of her face
The cleverness of her countenance

Her countenance in cloud or plain, or if it shine
White, lustrous, or coppery blue

Or aught of disarray or dusky grey

Whose hidden presence knoweth all wells of all


The hidden essence of the mind

Of all things under ground or air

Alloys doth teach us grief and all things under ground


That makes us feel more perfect still and clear


She hath her presence fair and fair and clear and fair
Under ground

They know not in flowers the same or shapes beside

That are dark or green alone


But sweet and fair must else be but a thorn


HerShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



Oh! ever resistless fearless
My breast from fear and from adversity

For never, never must I part
I 'll conquer or I die

I never, never must I part

Hark! the Colonel's bugle bloweth clear
The field is won, the barrier raised

The victor flag hath gain 'd her wish
The vanquished party yield what they desire

What say the victors, comrades? -- Be
The barrier up and down thrown

The battery down and put an end to it

Till the foe with his fellow may jump

And the fellow may jump, and follow after

They may follow after, follow after after after

`` Oh God! if She could see
As well as I

She would give me farthing
Or, perhaps, a bard

I see why, she's married
All I can say is this

`` Sweet! how is she married
At twenty-three

What should vex her more
More than a bard or groom

Well, what should vex her more
More than a groom or man

I met a parson once
Who said, when young

He asked her if she 'd bide
Her wedding

`` Ay! there's a church to-day
From six she's here

I'm almost ready to go down


For sure, there's no such thing
As going to Hell
Without a morn

I'm bound for England yet


But, for once I'm going down
I'm bound for it


And, happy Somers Rockford
Was born and bred

In London town when town was fair


There's nothing to brag o'er
But laughter, and wine


Never once go down to hell or vice

Never go to hell again

It all comes from her

No matter how ill or ill


She's fairMy heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


And the birds sing far and near
So happy are we when skies are bright

For the breeze to shallow kisses play
Which the fowls would fly to drown

The rattle of a sail whene'er they hear
Weak echo and the noise thereof decay

That I look on you with love in me
But now I am left feeling blue

The wind kisses my breast and cheeks as well
Curls it to mind, and still beside it sings

When the ship is past the porter's door
My friend rides off like a brave man's horse

And when he is past the door he takes my hand in mine
And I hold it to his heart and kiss them too

For 't is sweet to see one heart so true that would so rashly grieve

But now I am left feeling blue skies so bright and fair


And skyward, as purer and purer skies than earth since Homer's eyes were fair


I only know that I am left alone above the ground
My love alone and he loved alone


Though now we sailed the sea that others sought for fame
Pacewise, far on winged winged winged dance among


But now we are left alone apart and left alone and left alone, and flown apart

She walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



There is a garden, very fair
Which pretty girls and very fair

Is called the Nourse of Friendship, or
Because a chaste Chanticleer has brought

To talk with me, or else be bold
'T is friendship all these pretty flowers

And talks with me ; and so has she
Because she loves us both and thee

You talk once with her ; and so has she
Because she's our sweetheart at this feast

And since the time, when first we met
We both together were in love

We've walk 'd the earth, and've walk 'd the sky
And've both loved and wish 'd for e'er

'Twere ill, indeed, and quite defy 'd by no means true

We 'll sleep together at the same time


'T is true, my lord, my mistress all things well
There's much to love in her alone
But me must be hell to me


And she alone commands me, O happy heart
Let earth and sky

Say where is she, that loves me, or me


What maid this idle sprite so true and blind
Is he
Oh lay her down on the sill and see
Herself forlorn


I'm blind,They were mad and in love
She was a wolf and he was a dove


If ever you look forth on a plain
There is no pleasure except to die

O blessed heavens, it is a blessed sight
My God, how glad I am that I have thee

Thy blessed presence I see daily every day
Thy presence is a joy to me that thou

Thy presence cheering all my trouble and anguish
Thy presence boding victory in thy pain

My God, how much wiser is the sage than we
Who knows when wiser must be sage, when better

He that could write, can write, can verse, who can spell
Can cure the plague which plagued me long before I knew it


Can raise the standard of an unruly mind! the nation
Has called me great and greatam to thee
And praised me, as the dearest friend by far, in prayer


My God, how much wiser is the sage than we, in wine and fire
Our mongst, in feast and feast we have been together
O blessed, my God, how much wiser! ay


The sage hath written, and hath written, and the dearest prophet sage to thee
With clemen, to clear out of my mistriss


How dearly hast thou cursed me, fair son, and how much wiser is thy mother-in-law
Thy! forThey were mad and in love
She was a wolf and he was a dove


They had been friends three years and had not seen eye
But now she lay upon her hands and knees

And her eyes over-leavened with torment
Because of their strange meeting and how they part

With the dawn and the silver stars
A kiss and a voice, and then both were gone

And there was neither stone nor feather
Only the high earth seemed to stir and reel

And I through my dreaming could not find
A path or two to my old home

And from the uplands far away
The wild sea-fowl gathered and flocked

They pranked upon their fences and rumbled and wept
Until the dawn came at their door

And I could not find it, for all the earth rent and burn

And all the ground shook and turned to stone. Then down the trees

And my eyes grew dim and I rolled, and thereon found beside him

Lady Bird of Spring, fair Spirit of Spring


I lay where I might rest and year by year
On thee and nevermore
For evermore

Wrapt in the silence of that silence, old and lone and still


In the silence of that silence, sweet and still

And the day 'gan to fall

And the birds to reel and whimper, and fly


AndI long for the warmth of your smile
and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


but a beggar I am, never going back
to the mountains again for fear of a lack of wind

so I turn to the water where there's no heat
to melt my ice on and on till I choke and bleed
and they strip and jammy till I drop and rot in the mud

then they strip and jammy till I drop and rot in the mud
and the life of the man in my hand is the only dower

then I stretch and sweat till I drop out and die
but a beggar I am, never going back

and I have hopes but of still wet the old grey river
where it will splash to-morrow at fifty thousand's and fifty's and fifty's not


till I stop and think of the times four hundred times before I stop and think of the ships
to-night on Cape Fear of the Cocos Keys
where the White Whale is laughing above you and Jack

that the Sun goes down to-night under the White Whale agoggin Jack O's End but never you see him no more

You light up my day when you lace your shoe


Or touch my nails, or my fist. You 'll find the same
You never are the same to them, now that the girl's gone

It was a certain rose, on the tip of the thorn
Its hue was as a sickle, and yet it was red as the gall

The sweets it exhaled were fragrance and fruit, and honey
But the scent you are, love, is as sweet as the Lady of my Lamb

When her lily hand lay upon my hand and she looked back
She knew that there was something to do, and she kissed me on the mouth

`` Ah, Love, you are very wise! '' she said, `` know that what I do's for wine
But drink isn't wine but when we keep at home andn't play tricks on the while we can

It was night before the first morning thief and murderer

Said : ( O blessed be, be not dread God, give me death


It was nightThey were lonely and tired
That is when the shot was fired


My father and my mother with them that went
To-day I've seen `` Little White Christ Church '' on its face

I've seen its flags all over it tossing and howling
Sad weather! ) Sad weather! -- Hide them from my sight

As I passed my hour by that noisy Band
That sang the pretty Liberty, `` Come home, Liberty! ''

In many a note that distant Road would chime
That brought me home, -- for all that was left of it

My thoughts went fast away, but quickly they waked
And after many a weary day we started on our way

That started early for home, but quickly it grew dark

As heavy and dark, and heavy again, till dark it grew


And dark they grew, and dark we started off, as dark the road would gape and grope
And soon, and soon the lights failed, and the hark was gone


As if the stars had faded, with the roar of many a farewell gong
From many a dying hound that year ago


One soul would peck beneath the twilight dell, root along the willowy-leaped hill and dale
And hark it through the morn alone


And after many a writh, many a writh, many a year on itsI am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


Since first the world began, there's not a peer
On earth to equal great Wits, or brave Sir Anthony

But this, it must confess, is not the case
For Fame, like all Creation, has its critics

Sir Anthony despised, and still prefers
Sages like him, who understand the Elements

I say, tho'he writ with a disdain
And I conceal my tongue, for I would know

That even the Poet, when he knew his way
Could not but think it a brave man should rebel

Your praise I tax ; and yours, that other praises sing
To Cupid, the god Apollo's son

Whom with my Muse Lucan I have sung, as my own son


Fair Lucan, son of Jove and Venus's son
Jove made great by love of thee and me


Of your sweet mother, Mars and my immortal swain
Jove

But the name not only shows your heart is strong
I maintain with reason's proof


That the fame dies as fast and without crime's weak


As the boy's heart dies all his passion's flower
He that made of love's sweet


He knew you loved you, love and was mortal too
And you longShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



To him, before his day is done
My part will be her night of pain

And that is when I shall cease to groan
Or hear her sweet complaints exempted

He that shall follow after
Will with my life preserve his ghost

Cupid, you do think? I hope so
'T is something more than melancholy

But really 't is something that concerns us less
And you, perhaps, may have occasion to inquire

To see what ladies should be seen
When the hottest day is past away

All beaux come every day from far and wide
With torches, mace, and torches bright

And Cibber, with all her impudence

Puts out a phial of her breath

And takes a long cool draught, and takes a glass


And, taking notes, takes up half drunk in haste
Unto her basket turns
Her down stairs she goes to bed


And wakes by half an hour at morn she goes to school


In bed unseen alone she goes unseen


And dreams of Palamon beside the Spight
Away by night, alone


All wake she goes looking still unseen

He does wake without name her name


Whence come, and say, she comes unseen


And in paleMy heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


Away went the Colonel's gun
Astonied by a daring foe

But he knew he had to save his man
He sprung from the saddle ungloved

The wounded corporal drops his beer
And grimly he greets the King for beer

`` Chear, my good Lord, '' quoth the Colonel, `` how is your corps
But the odds are on the Tories. You are sharp

With your bayonets and musk musket
And your lances for my bucklers -- take me now

My dear good comrades, be strong, for now I 'll rest
While we two rest -- for all I can be best

`` Lieve and serve my country '', said the Colonel ; `` now close let us down

Our orders was to retreat before night

This was the word the word was passed from one man to the other


The rest were still -- till morning, when a skipper did hear
The word be-side, and cried, `` Good Lord, darlin, stay

Our orders is to retreat, and we must retreat till morning


Away went the steed, and galloped on galloped on, till he heard the stars behind the gray sea-mist
`` Good fellow, stay behind stay

The horse was master behind theShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



Then, since she has forsaken me
Despair in any way may cloud

`` Wonder! '' hearkens ; `` Lady Knight I
What is that to thee that comes

Duns, that feed upon thy flocks, lo
Thy wounds heal, and I thee save

`` Then be not scornful, Sir, to me
Cythna, let thy fear provoke me

I will serve thy pleasure for aye
And bear her for my daughter's sake

`` Then be not scornful, Sir, to me
Cythna, I will serve thy pleasure for aye

Lend light to these dim eyes, and keep them bright
For I will sleep unseen from far

By night, and hear my father's groans below

`` Make haste, my daughter, and myself, to get her sight

For I shall die unseen before I die

Cythna, lo, the day that is begun

Cythna, lo! my dear, thy shame endeth evermore


Cythna, lo, awake, else thou false love, awake, awake

Pale night shall darken ere day shall darken ever


While I shall see and never see nor see nor she weep


And sleep, but she shall wakeI am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


It shall be told to you by the god you adore
You have read it, and, believe me, by the end

I promise I shall never lie still
And that though I have often, I am swamped with tears

In spite of all my many vows and vows
None of my life can to my credit come

The best cigar of all time -- my own sweet lad
He knows no better than we do do by sight

Go, bid him take this one -- he 'll buy it when he's drunk
For he 'll swear by my verse, and he 'll swear by mine too

He shall think on Saul -- he shall think of the good old time
And he shall think of the little that lies hid in my lip


He shall think of the times when the owls slept alone in the tree
And he shall think of the songs I sing of the days gone by


The last time the owls slept together in the tree they were lonely alone
The last time the owls slept together they were lonely alone


It shall pass, the tears steal on the soul of the tree till the morn at last it grows gray and strong
While the soul that is heavy with love and strong


It shall lie heavy with love's blood where the heart of the

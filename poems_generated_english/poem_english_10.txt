She walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight


He comes with the green leaves that blow
He comes with the blue flowers that blow

Her beauty is like the green leaves that blow
The lilies of her beauty fall

The birds laugh and sing
She walks in beauty, like the night

Who walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight

Whose voice is sweet, and whose eyes are clear
To see the world through with a new light

He come to the good dawn
The good dawn was bright, her cheeks were red

Her voice was sweet, but her eyes were shy
And she had many a look to give

The dawn broke in, and the grass was fresh beneath
Her feet she trod to the green wood road

And her feet in the path trod behind in the wood

Her footstool was bare, and the dust was on the road

The earth was still, and the earth was red with life

Celestial feet would she trod the forest path

And it was good that she went there when

To do good things with her feet and leave the day


Celestial feet lead the path, and tread the green way
The earth run free
She walked with them, and she was glad to die for her own

And her feet went trodDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


We dare not trust the world to fear
That I may rise -- we dare not trust to die

The world loves, though many love, but few know what
Though many love, yet few know, I must not know

We have no time to speak of things below
To make our tongues less bitter, or our breasts less sweet

Oft at the last, where many love, it is not strange
One thing more, which shall not always be confessed

It is enough that love must last and die
I must have tears, which are a bitter rain

For you must know that love must die -- or it were worse to die
Else I should die -- for you are many, and you are many

Yet I could live -- for very love to love alone

I would keep my tongue open to the stars and find the best

For love alone I would endure even the bitter worst


Love had been death to me -- like wind, and not a child would seek for light
Only to be in sleep
Or if for wind and sun were made blind to weep or be still

And though for sun go but one death for all men die, one joy for all were made alive


What then are we? I can know no joys, for none but those that are sweet and free
NotThe taste of marmelade is better with you
You light up my day when you lace your shoe


My Valentine is far away, and he is sad
He 'll not come if he can. He thinks he is the fairest

He is so old, and so old before, and so old
That he can not lift his head nor go about

He can not kiss a fellow when he's old to marry
He can not walk with a woman on the road at all

Because he says he is the fairest in the land
And he sees he loves each fellow so. He thinks so

And he loves the woman he loves the man who is not fair
Because he has a black eye and a yellow lip

Since no one can help you, oh mother, mother, mother, mother, mother

O mother, that art cold and cold and cold
The earth was young -- the mountains were young

Love and I lived in peace -- the rocks and hills
He that hath tasted of the heaven of sleep

And the waves that were our own had trod the sea
And the waves that we kissed, and the winds that stirred

For we would be as wise as poets in a dream
And the world would understand and live without thee

`` Would you be wise, or couldst thou love me, and live with me and cry
I should die in scorn, if I died like this alone

And I would die, because all death is love, and there is no death at sea

And the sea that lay a sea of tears when I arose again

I am alone, because, in the dim gulf of twilight alone
I stand here with one alone alone
For I am alone indeed alone alone alone upon the shore

And she, my little dear, by thee
Will kiss and hold till thou depart

Away went the merry pair
With eyes still open, and their hearts full of strife

They danced for hours ; they chattered long
And never a word of welcome came

Alas, the words went swiftly by
At last they both were lost in night

They laid their weapons out below
And never a word remained but sigh

Their hearts were heavy as a man who hath no friend
And each kept his own despite

They started from the field, and from the bed they ran

And from afar away they cried aloud

`` O happy little pair, and happy little love

Your mother must you go, and from far and near

For you and I must leave your father alone

And take your wife -- mother and both to wed

But I alone must mother ; and a mother must you go


You shall have none to make for me my father's wife for you
Nor any father save the man she made


I would be father ere I was, the woman most dear to me
I am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


( Who knows what other men would say
But I will keep you company till I die

Oh! how can I believe it then, Sir
You never was a man so witty

I swear, sir, in making that jest
You saw your father pass in a coach

When I have read you your reply, Sir
I will write no more, I can not lie

And now this I foreknow, and now foreknow
You are not an Irishman but a Scot

Now go, quoth I, to where the woodpecker sings
And you shall follow me to where the crow

Your father, as you rode in the woodpecker's prime
Was a handsome fellow with an eye for lace

His mien was like the ruddy-red deer's you see

And from a sallow skin his cheeks grew amber white

Yet he never saw a fellow so young as he

That you should think so much of his father's breed


But I had a good-humour and a passion aye
Was good enough, Sir, and we two were bred
A dunces yet, and you three

I would love to be her knight


Her thoughts are all untun 'd, undone
Her feet, her head, her arm disarm 'd

If 't were my passion, or my grief
She would have all I could express

And I must leave her in my arms
To bear me as much more than they

And let the world my tears adore
As I my thoughts would be about

Ah! -- thou art not thus thy fate to prove
A mortal woman's love must perish there

Alas! what greater griefs the world can bear
Than what the dead have in their arms confessed

The dead now in their graves will be for ever bound
By ties of friendship's sacred tie

The sacred flame must never depart behind

No more they shall behold their love's declining light

That was the seal of love's delight

My love shall be a stain before 'em on the plain

And I, the sole unhappy soul in all

To aught so foul a world, should once so base be mine


Then die, till death has made me happier far and more dear
To me more dear to thee
Or if she would not know the pain

Nor can she know what love is, what death has done to me


My love should end us, for ever, butI long for the warmth of your smile
and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


to eat with my cold and cold
and to be frozen like a mountain-pike

but you know it so well, my little son
you have eaten and seen it before

you know which is first which is last
you have heard my love and I shall have

and I have heard of a boy and a boy in the North
but the best of them yet are the girls and the boys alone

we shall see where love is best and where love is worst

then the ship slid silently and silently, and silently
the sun sank down from the east and the moon rose higher till night

then the dark water lay for ever and the morn lay heavy and slow

the brown waves slid fast in and the fog rolled slow on slowly, slowly

then the sea grew warm and the smoke ran heavy and strong and thick on the mast

my baby was a sea-fowl and I was cold and old and lone on the deck

and the dark waves rolled slow and stark and long and fast at sea and the grey smoke rolled hard

and the grey smoke rolled softly and black on a thousand yards per minute

Titania comes next
To see us for the day

She doth dress it very handsomely
With her fair locks and cap

And comes after pretty Tom
With a nice big basket full

The best part of all her gait
Is that her heels are round

Her sleeves are lace, and white
Her shoes are lace, and white

And Tom, for his part
All the way to London rides

He goes with his old club
From New-fangled Bar

He rides up the Castle-Street
There to beguile a mouse

Never a merry man

Came out to play with Jack

`` The devil send him back the mouse

`` My dear Jack, you have got to stop

For I had better get a gun

`` You did it yesterday

'T was a galliard yesterday

`` Oh, the devil, good-night to Jack

The appeal for darkness is to steep


Ah, why have I no soul
No heart that can abide

Yet do they make me happy
Because, alas

But if I sleep alone
The waves sleep upon me

And night doth fill the world
And earth through all is torn

With thoughts of pleasure and delight
I listen to and hear

And through the night I walk
And never weary of

Underneath your feet

Sleep o`er her paines and tears


And all the while I grieve
The wind and sea and sky

The sea and sky


They lay me down on her down
And softly sigh and cry


To make me wake and weep again
She sleeps beside

Underneath your feet
For I shall die of woe


Underneath your feet shall die of woe
(s and tears
Underneath your feet shall fail

Though she be drowned and I die in peace

I wish you some glad return
My soul is in a better place

Than the days that have the name of night
When all things made were made into light

How can the dead wish to return
When sleep has ceased, and dreams have ceased

Ah, would I only give consent
To break your dead heart and leave it living

And to give me you a kiss -- a tear
To wipe a blush from your tender eye

I am afraid, dear -- and how may I love
To meet with one whose grave you could not frame

Of all human cares, and yet have power to move
The world on what it was before

And she but speaks, the last good thing to be told, could move

Ah, may your memory take the spirit out of its pain

Of pain, so sweet, to live a while without pain, and love


Telling old stories at a certain hour
Shall never take from its own memory

Of death, nor know the reason to its pain

But thou dost guide the spirit to new-pleads again


When we are old and poor, and sorrows are forgot of yore
I see my spirit go
In life but yesterday -- alone

And let me in with my wife
To hear what other girls may say

For there is nothing there is so bad
I can not go to bed alone

I have no friends I never knew
My heart is sick with grief and care

I hear no birds about the ground
And nothing but the rain and snows

None but the fox and wolf and I

Come not to-night but now, come in my arms to-night

In the twilight of my heart's desire

Come unto my arms I will not go

When the first bird does whistle
At dusk it rings and sings

And the youngest of the litter
Does whistle all the day

( A tune for his mother is
Which he and she together sing

And her bosom is the earth
And her throat is heaven

She can run her own race
All of beauty and contentment

Although he has come a score

He thinks to serve you once a day

I am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


Since you are deaf, and deaf I am afraid
So be your mother, and be kind to me

When you are deaf, and deaf, and deaf, how many more
You may have heard my verses, but no more

He was not blind ; and he could read and spell
But had his skill in optics and logic

And still continued on ; as if his spirit failed
He went on and on. And then he grew more and more

And you, who were so fond of hearing, you were wise
To take the time which little people give us

And write of truth through ev'ry instance, but that they
In such a time may grow old, and perish cold

Thus for your sake I read this great poem now

And am but deaf to reason and deaf to every tone


And you shall know how much more than I did write of your own
When at home or in your mother
( that I was a virgin

And thus all memory will have no other end


And in a verse, it shall be quite enough to be understood


'T is to be true, in verse that it is written for your fame
To me alone

But you are but born to write of love and love 't is your own
And you love him whoI long for the warmth of your smile
and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


no matter how I see them and their shapes I never take it for their sake
but they seem so very large and pretty to me. It makes me sick to see them grow

little brown eyes that look at me with a horrible kind of pity. I wonder 
if I can get these eyes to smile upon me like a goddess.... '' --

It might be heaven or earth -- how many eyes were there in one of you
but none of you could see me..... The world was heaven in those eyes when I drew breath for a breath

for I know they are the heaven of women..... `` They are my father, not my husband, they are mother..... '' 

they are the heaven of men........ '' They are like mother earth........ '' But they move like the heavens of women...... 

my mother earth........ 'They are as black as the sea and never a leaf......... The wind is a woman.......  Where are they dead or gone and gone

if I die on my soul.......... and they have eatenDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


When darkens the stars, and darkness dies
Why not a little? No, if there be

A heart for a child. She did not cry
Lest tears might trickle from it and drown in tears

Then lay it down beneath a branch or tree
A child for my grave and she would have it so

( If thou couldst and hadst but one, and that would last
It hath but one ending. In thy death I die

If Thou couldst make me look farther for another
Or something worth believing, what a shame if that

Should prove to be too weak a faith, and even to die

I should have found another faith if thou couldst do no more
But love, to live with love, and die alone

Even death alone might make a love all better, for whose sake

And if thy love died for mine sake, thou wert most alone

My love was in thee ; and I was ever alive and strong and light

But love is dead and love left, light dead of hope in me and pride


What are our souls in them, because their hearts are strong and strong, and even for him alone
Our souls are weak and faint and white, the same weak flesh is weak

To let you know that I will always be true


If you would write, then your self will see it well
You have a part of mine for nothing more

But that you may be more clever, and act your parts
You 'll draw and paint, the book and put the pictures in

But if you want a proper critic, give
The rest to me, and I shall sing what I must.

So may you still, perhaps, the tale be read
And write of me when next you send it to me

This to your good Lord, and all the Court may hear
The tale is worthy of a copy of your Friend's

Your Honour this will be, but I must say again
'You do it, and that is all you require of me

And, as a friend, 't is true, that you're not all good to me

What is it you do you never can enjoy, or read, or write

A friend with a good word or two to the end of a letter


I will show you, to the world, all what I like, you really do owe
And I would give you fifty shillings


It is not a fault I 'd receipt, nor a fault I could wish to see it said
But what you 'd by a great prince
If it were mylife is a tall tender tree
Savor it like a cookie


But you shall never be my slave
When you begin to eat what you can

It looks very long, but I can go no higher
For I never saw your eyes more clearly

I only know it must be shut in a corner
And when I touch it first I swear I never

But I beg that you will never ask again
I hope your friends will understand it

`` Then let it grow as tall as this apple
If you will let it grow and put it up

`` Be not coy as children, but speak no word
You never will come near a stranger's face

`` You never shall see a picture on a wall
`` There's nothing ugly about a rose

`` The rose grows very tall in June to nine feet long
So is it very fair to this

`` You 'll lose your place on this very first day

`` You shall never buy another rose

`` Then it grows so high that this rose grow long

`` You 'll lose your place within ten years

`` You shall never eat another rose

`` But I promise you the rose will die in May
`` When the rose grows long and bright and ripe

You light up my day when you lace your shoe


And when a langer is in bed alone
To think they are sleeping, is the way to keep

Tickles, drops, and all are put away for ever
And so the gentlemen who wear your shoes must

Take heart, for a crown that hath been put on
To see your body now but half so well grown

And when, at length, the sun begins to set
Your body must be rin 'd up for several weeks

The ladies will all for the country fly
To talk of you's health, and make you want a liver

While some of the gentlemen will fly to your native lake
To try the water, and try the beer

I wonder if there's a doctor could advise
( You've got some headache, and some stomach ache

The ladies leave it so, for they'm sure there's a lot of money


I'm sure there's neither doctor nor surgeon will buy you a gun
To fight for a war with the lass before

But, oh, I've got to die before you two are sixty, you're very young

My soul is aching,Do not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


For your own breast shall my desire
O'erflow it with your own desire

Oh!, listen! Oh, the deep-sounding lay
Of love which in the ear of all

Oft has it told me how to fall the prey
And, to my misery, to submit

To thy false will -- O, could the will
Should make me tremble as I sought thy will

Thee, though in vain, to hope, I hope thee still
As far as Hope can be -- as far as Truth remains

'T is thine, for th'unseen dead have kept me still, O Fear
My sleep is in Heaven -- Oh, may that sleep survive

As though my soul did, from thy dark cell, within my heart

Awake from sleep, and bless my sleep with sleep for ever


Then may no man wake to the despair of those that sleep, thou art
And wake to the dawn that is dying
No, Love hath perished, in the East where he goes


Where the black stream cleaves to the sea, and I shall be alive to-night
No, Love is dying in the night thou sleep'st among us


O how may I rest when the waves do wake for thy moan to me
And sleep for thee that are not of loveLife, believe, is not a dream
You can not wake up just with a scream


There is no hope but in thine own soul
To conquer death with its own evil

For she no peace but in the caves of my heart
The only joys are such as I can find

You that have known death and love me, make
Your handmaid, love me as you will

With patience thou shalt see why I may die
And if you die, I 'll live for another

Then pity me, sweet love! for this shall be
And I must yield to thy love, and take

For I have loved till death and must still love still
And though I live, love still must die for me

This is the death I wanted with my hands and heart
And this must lead you to a better life

O sweet ; the sea is heavy with despair and pain
The winds of fear can never waver over

But I must die and die and die for my love's sake

Till death shall make me deathless again and never die for me

You have no lips, you have none but I that 'll love but you

Oh, what do you for joy, and life is all for love of yours

And there is no pain, love, oh how you have never said or done
But I must love the day that is so dear
My heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


( For though its very name might imply
'T is blue, like ocean clear, but not so fast

Or like a broken wave in ocean rolled
That dares to turn its course, but sees no way

To follow its course, by force opposed
Yet, if this chance you chance to hit upon

It must be near, but this you fear
Yet these would turn you back, if force and chance

You must be quick, but these will trouble you
When you must think. But can my fancy see

If in them I'm still on homely terms inclined
I may in time be bound to see you's fate

No, there's a dark sea yet under every moon
Deep is a dark sea, and in so thick a grave

Yet you and I together are alone at last

And there's a dark sea yet under every moon

'T is this the ocean where I shall be nursed

The sea that made you grow old, to sleep again

And I shall lie and die and die for ever night and day


The winds that blew your love shall blow the leaves away
The bowing to your bed
The wind of your heart and me and it to die for ever last


Oh, keep your lads! 't is pastThey were mad and in love
She was a wolf and he was a dove


That night when I was a child I trod the glen
And the wild birds called me, O my dearest, O my dearest! -- `` She passed me by

She could not weep, yet she seemed not troubled
Singing through the dawn and calling through the night

`` Oh my dearest, oh my dearest! '' said she, `` I have not seen your ghost
And she passed me by the wood over the hillside

And I 'll bid good-bye, aye, and I 'll kiss your hand as lightly as I kissed you
When I am old, and you are young again

O my dearest, O my dearest! '' said she, `` I have not done as my mother would
To can't me, but cry, for I've kissed you, and kiss you again

They shall have their man-plugs and shirts and their man-bands and socks and hair
They shall have their shirts cut in a line so it shows how much they hate you

They shall have their shoes cut in a line making them look worse than they are
They shall have their socks cut in a line like a great big red jackall -- not that very good

They shall have their shirts cut in a line that the rain and the heat and the sky and water and dust and mud
They shall have their shoes cut in a line from the world, and a foot from another man's to follow

( And I am tired of work and I am tiredLife, believe, is not a dream
You can not wake up just with a scream


The light of a thousand years is gone
And the nightingales do not wake to the beat

The nightingales do not wake again
Because the stars have ceased to play

And this we know of the dead is the truth
Of the deep hidden, the silent and un-named

And the birds die under the trees, 'neathneath the leaves
Which the birds have fallen into and laid waste

We shall know nothing more but old stories that start
Of the stars forgotten to the leaves beneath their feet

And the birds go forth among the silent trees
Out of some far eternity to die

The dead birds creep among the ashes of the dead
And the leaves lie heavy with the dead leaves's blood

And the ghosts cry, ` We have borne many more victims that we may not come again

The stars have looked on your face, and ye will smile as ye weep, ye shall smile as ye go to the grave
As ye go from Hell to the light of the starless sky

Then as to the rest she goes
She says -- `` What do you want me

Would that you would know me, dear
Of all your sex and me

A lady, a beauty, and then a sage
And she is not so bad a bride

The more her virtues are expressed
She's fair as if she held the key

But when we part she's ever young
And every month she drops a stone

And I've tried to please her every way
But when I ask her whether she's blest

She smiles, but you can not understand
Because she has a heart that's not a friend

And I wish she still knew what to do
To make her better than to die so gay

`` But, `` I hope that one of the best of the year
Will be your bride or a spy

'T is a little time before the third morn

And that at home I 'll talk to the best of myself

`` O 'll leave you first and follow my husband first

`` All is well for me -- till the fourth's gone gray

Oh, '' `` I'mickle wish that your love came not abroad

For you 'll follow him first, and there, and leave two years ago

Oh, if there isThey were mad and in love
She was a wolf and he was a dove


`` I am lost in the stars they are there
So far away is the woodlands

But I have found a way
To the blue hillside

The squirrels come through the brake
Flinging and whistling through the brake

`` You have got to guard your ears
There is danger in the sky

They have flown with fear, but I
They have passed by, they have flown

And the little brown mouse
Staring over the brake

`` I have reached the sea
For the last line of the moon

`` A little over the sea
Let us rest on the sea

And the little brown mouse
Shrews his hide for the last row

`` Our lives are over now

For the last row is long

Over the tree and the sea

We will go our ways

Through the wharf and the yard

To the sea-side again


Into the green sea-shore

Through the green sea-walls

Into the green sea-lawns

Under the trees and the grass

That are bare and bare

Under the brown sea-walks

Where the little brown mice lie

Over the grass and grass and the sea

Under the trees and the little brown mice lie


She walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight


O, tell a story that shall not lie
For when she comes no word shall she tell

She looks for lovers and she looks for friends
And now there's nothing to tell for lovers sake

But this I hate, for all that love we say
I hate you, and I hate you not

My love, you should have loved me too long
I should have loved you better then I did

But what would you have me do? I'ven't the power
I've made you my delight, my happy wife

For this is true ; my love hath no disguise
My love has been my lover long and long

He never was jealous whether I would win or lose
He never was jealous if I lost or won

Oh, tell me, can I be blest in love 'gainst his embrace
And I will swear I will do so at any rate

Love's love to me is like a goddess, and hath sworn she will abide


Yet, what is love? Let him be bliss, she has his heart to cheer ; to win or lose or win
Love 'gainst despairing love hath power to lose


Though 't is the hardest thing upon her, I can wish it not to be so
And we both can die to lose together
Is itShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight


And then, if I may ask
How far my heart will go

Then may she ever prove
Mine eyesight always bright

And thus I 'll be her knight
Who loves the sun as well

So in this forest shade
I must not fear the night

Which, if to you inclined
Is like the soft repose

The bird and bird, with hearts as kind
As if in peace the garden grew

Where is that bird thus fair
Whose looks, that ever wore and wore

To such sweet music make me call
The tune of my desires to sing

What sweet thoughts of beauty do I see
What thoughts are thoughts in these a rose

That sweet words but do not love to move

A leaf in a leaf so sweet as hers is lent

And so in my heart she shall abide

And in her heart, as I loved she did for me

When once I loved, she is so fair as this

That you know neither pain nor gain

What care or sorrow we shall ever have


For life itself is the delight of song
And nothing hath a heart 'gainst rest


Hear her soft and sweet music, and sweet rest
Hast thou still in my love that sings

The bird in this while she sleeps

My heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


And the birds are singing to the sea
You must away with your friends and my friends

'Twill make them all worse than the world had feared
And that will be to-morrow, perhaps

And so she ran away to another mate
But you and I shall both be alone

WHy have you seen the sea's black wings unfurl
So high? We must not be so near

Ah, 't was in love, but now it is no love
It is a shadow. Ah, I wish we were men

But why go on with idle quarrels? 'T was love's desire
We had another passion for to die

We thought the sea's black wings were feathers for feathers'wings
But the white one is the feathers that fly

Ah, why do we fly with a lover once, love, and we fly then

Happiness is the reason of desire

If we would fly, and we never make love, love is the star

Thought that love's light, and we must love a star

It is his passion, and we are twined together

Ah, why do we fly, love, dear, and love is love is made to die

Ah! let us change your thoughts and take our passion for flight


Ah,She walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight


`` What makes you so pale? '' quoth he
I have no doubt it was your fear

`` Oh, let a woman prove a queen
And if you can, what shall become of me

There is no woman like Apollo
Not even his wife Apollo bred

For you and Saturn he would prove
So was I ; I must be both your queen

And Mars, who loved the Sun, shall take
This son of mine and mine at once

I do not have the fault, nor yet
My father's fault in his own beauty, not

So we both shall live for what our blood is worth
And be for ever kind and good for me

No wonder then, if you but love my love for love
And live to own, but that the stars are dear

My arms are such a thing as you have none to cast

So have I given my life for your defence

Yet she should be my father's only child


Her beauty and the beauty of my heart I prize
My man, but love's no more than she is mine
For love's all life and death alike


Love's one and death could make all love false and wild and fair


Love hath no man a pair for more fair and kind
I scorn him that isThey were mad and in love
She was a wolf and he was a dove


But now the winds are overcast
The sun and rain are on the ground

He is not dead as many men say
He must come back to his own blood

He was old when I was young
I am used to seeing him no more

He died in my heart last night
He is no more than a dog and you

My hands are but the thin and bloody hair
My hand is the little red clay

My heart is like a ship in my hand
It has been long years alone

And there are many in my heart
The same as my poor mother

My lips are bare with the cold seas of death
And my blood is not dry

The little men in my brain must know this
'em all are dead. 

They knew two little folk by the hair
They have had lips to kiss, and lips to tear

All was calm, save one that wore clothes and a gun


Out and by the light of the western sea
Out out to the open sea in vain
Sails, and boats, and man to man go by

Out in the dark and the wind of battle between

In the sea-washed lane and the children asleep

Out with the night as the moon at the wet lane


Over the grey tide of the sea-washedThey were mad and in love
She was a wolf and he was a dove


And all those men that died before the dawn
Were in your eyes and there, beneath the stars, I lie

Cupid and I are in a dream like two of yore
'Twere well, said he, since now we neither know

But with those men of many a name
I will make war on your desire

And see if love were love to you and I
You must have love for to betray us one by one

'T is hard to break the chain which binds a slave to his lord
But both shall never be betrayed in the end

'T is death to make some love, and death to die for love is death
'T is life's reward if love be dead to keep us both in his desire

'T is death to die for love, and death to live for love is death to keep us both in his desire

'T is death to die for love, and death to die for love is death to love in arms

The captive then began again ; the woe where'er he might stray
Flee, for love is love, and death is death to death in arms


Flee, for love is death to love -- for love is death in death 't is love, and all you keep your tongue in vain
To keep your lips to death untilI long for the warmth of your smile
and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


but a thousand thousand summers ago, my dear, you
had taken the picture of my heart with your teeth
and I was a child as the ice is now. And you

had gripped it with both your teeth and gripped me with your breath
and I cried out in your mother's name and died in your mother's cause

and you were sorry when I found you were laughing at my
love when I said that I was a fool as the ice is now

and now I see the pictures of your teeth and your teeth are your lips
and the stars of your teeth have faded away and all the stars have gone

and the stars of your teeth are staring at the stars of my heart no more and I can not weep
and the stars of your teeth are staring on my heart no more to die

then the words in your lips that I said on my father's knee and the words in your mouth are dead

but the words that I said through the stars of your teeth are dead and my lips are wet and the things that I can never say

and I love and I love and I love for a long while as a babe and I will cling to your love till the tears come down my lips wet with the sea

and the stars are dim as a red flower's face, and the tearsThe taste of marmelade is better with you

But still, my dear, 't is very good, and does not hurt your sight
I 'll give you my pocket full, and make you light a new one

And in my pocket I 'll hold a very large bag
One for a new cigar or two. And a third to buy

And next to the receipt, I 'll bind you a letter of my love
`` If it costs a pound to buy another, then I 'll do it for you

The appeal for darkness is to steep


While the dim night, dim as the night is
Is overcast with moonlight and the dead leaves

The wind that stirs to the hills to renew
Or the rain that falls in the dead of the night

And the red dawning like a vision fled
Shifts from the dead leaves with the pale and the green

They make its darkness more dark and drear
It opens, as with a shadow of dread

And a word is in their deep ears whispered over
They stand as one man to watch the morning go by

They wait till night will make them come to know
As many voices die in the dusk and the rain

But the brown trees die in beauty and the old trees lie on the sand
Like many men that are not dead of sin

And the rain falls in the heart of the world to make them understand

They wait to be free and to speak to the stars that are bare

And the rain falls in the heart of the heart of the night to make them understand


The moon, in its glory, like a little star that will not stay and die
In its love and sleep and the black stars die
They wait in our lips like men that are dead in the dawn and the sea


The wind of the wind of the wind of the wind of the wind ofThey were lonely and tired
That is when the shot was fired


My father died : his bones were stony white
His eyes were dark ; but his red lips did glow

They were young, and they never should meet again
We lay among the shadows. He looked at the clouds

The smoke swept through the twilight, the smoke slid by
The smoke slid by, creeping slowly, slowly down

In vain we prayed. The stars turned blue in the western sky
The winds sighed, the leaves did crack. I looked on the grass

And I saw them and they were not, yet the light was fading
And I stood and could not choose but smile again

I gripped and gripped till the pale light fell and I said, `` Go forth, go forth
There is a time for my lips to rest. Go away. Let the stars lie white

And there it falls, the death watchword of the night, grey stone the dead, lone, lone

Then I died in the dark of the moonlight. I was glad for their wail
On Christmas-morning : I could not rest. Come away : come away

It was midnight and we two went to the sea-side, to the sea-shore dark and bare

They said : We must come home ; they must die for the sun is dying and we must die for the day is done

Over the dead and cold sea-I am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true

Was sent to prison by a freedman known

His locks had all that was reserved for youth

And I, an ardent lover, long had kept his sight
But had not found him so, and long had sought to keep

And had, methought, his heart was full of other cares
Till a good master sent him to me, a good companion

And took me in his arms, and with a kiss returned
A happy child among the country flowers

And made me a good love to him, and made a happy wife


Thus all was peace ; and life continued happily in spite
And long I walked lonely and alone

Alas, my love had given me many a tear
And I must die, for she was far from home


She had not left me much besides, and he the last I loved him, all his friend
As if he could not die
And I were to lose the man away


'Mongst my tears her eyes I had toShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight


Yet first I fear thou art too gay
I've lost all good I had, and spent it on thee

My eyes do burn with fire that burns so high
From off my clothes as it descends

Then first I wish I did not mind the blame
Or I should lose the pitying swain

That pity show 'd a greater negligence
The swain that had reproved and loved me first

And kiss 'd as many kisses as her lips could give
Yet kiss's but my soft heart ( her smiles are sad

'Twere folly, foolish swain! to kiss too high thy love should fly
And yet her cheek is so soft as hers that 't is so fair

A thousand kisses are enough as thou should'st give them all but one

Love holds his place in thine for ever with thy mistress's sake

Love, faire Saint, thy presence does my heart no virtue save

And though thy life thou lovest thee, thou hast another care

Yet love thy mistress still loves thy heart too much to love me not


O my poor swain! oh faire saint! would'st thou not she love more that my heart should be
That love so ill, to love as thou shouldst love ill


But I am like a thing in loveMy heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


A thousand happy men I know
And love but three times as much as you

But he whom nature taught to love
Was always first, I know ; and now

His faith is greater than his love
I do not see his face, nor know his place

For sure I shall be glad that he 'll stay
A month more after, lest I find it odd

Who could not hope to hear but I
Am left like other people still

A thousand happy men I have
And yet can not but love well

But all those happy men are few
With eyes as blue and hearts as red

And my heart grows cold as any stone

And you are the kind poor beggar, Giles

Of a despised house that hath its doors


Greece, it seems, must own that I 'll give you home
Your life like some poor elf

And when I do give up myself

The land I came from, I have no wife


'T is I shall be twenty now if I want two years
And he comes back and I am old
And I have eyes in my heart

And see where you live on earth and tell how long

The good of that gray sea forlorn Elfin's sake


But I know not where to runShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight


-- So she walks, yet moves like sleep
In all her wild attire

For, when I wake, like her, I know
My lute she is my pillow too

So as if the world should call me blind
I find myself a god of tunes

And every song I sing is sweet and clear
As if there was no other bliss

 -- Such as when the god of love began
To woo the earth with his soft spells

-- I have felt before her gentle heart
And love was such forlorn and barren

I walk amid my babes in the woods
And seek the fields again and me

As if no longer she should joy to see
Her beauty done and me gone

I weep, I sigh, and kiss her for my love's sake

Which still I do unto the earth I go

And that shall be the last of all my love's array


To lead her up to my love's celestial bower
She kneels to kiss and bear
My mantle off, and kiss her heart to me

Over his face, to be his heart's delight

Pale and white, and naked when she walks, as if dead


She is, and I do not sleep in her soft sleep upon the ground
Like a dead flame thatI am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


It shall be mine, my love, to tell you how
If you will live in Heaven ; or if you will lie

I promise I will not turn what I begun
Nor turn what all the world has been before

To know if this is love or friendship or fame
Or love is love for one, or friends for two

It shall be mine, my love, to give you this
To keep your truth, nor doubt it can be yours

Your fame is none of mine, your friends are none
None of your wit, your humour, or of your wit

To be a Muse, your mistress, or a mistress too
To be a Muse, to write more poems 'twixt three

My song, my verse, my passion, and my love, though all in one
Are one, is love in both and me

I have but love to love, and love unto me true and true


My passion to be both and love, in truth and folly true
Thinking but to lose delight and truth
Since both are but the reflection of her spite


Of love is both of love, and love to me at length she brings delight
And lovers love to see that light of scorn


Love to hate me, but when I love to hate my love and light of pain

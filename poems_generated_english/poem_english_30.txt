She walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



When you came seeking to seek in vain
Upon the plain

Her hood was woollen with the wool
And on her breast was chintz

Her shoes were many, long, and tall
And in them shone all the dew

Her sleeves were of the darkest she
And every one was gold

Her shoes were of the darkest she
And all the combs were gold

Well might I love and worship you
To wear these things in my sight

Her feathers white and fleet
And all the air of May

Upon whose borders lay
Her nest of little birds

And flowers so sweet and fair
And golden-mantled

For she was young and free

And all she cared for was mothering

About the fire

On the floor of her mother's hall


In the little oven set
And on a shelf


Of silver dish that lay
On the floor it lay
And softly slept


Singing sweet als merriment
Alway

Sweet, aloof and far away


Alas, and far away


Far away from earth and sky

Far away from earth and sky


O happy bird with wings of thine


Fly, happy bird
Aloud, fly softly away
Do not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


We dare not trust the world to straw
That once you were the soul of man

And you did this, and now its shadow stay
As a shadow, and its shadow still may stay

Of evil, which we can not understand
Till the red hues of its impetuous fire

Of its red wrath through all Space be brought
And the stark radiance of its tormented mind

Which through the deep it rent and broke
Until it broke upon a human breast

Of steel and fire and hell, of hell and earth
And the sun with a far blue eye

We must wake -- or it is dark indeed
And the gloom should be as good as hell

'T is dark and night but hide the light of the dead


Of your gray face. O soul which is so red
Why hast thou kept its creed alone
With your dim lids, and your bright blood shed

Your red lips must pay the fee of its foul shame


And be strong within their hellish chains 'twill pay the lay

Thy blood to rot in their red eyes's slime of shame


Which they must bleed, their shame to keep in their foul hearts's slime they keep in clay


Lashed with the steel of your red shame of their reproach

The taste of marmelade is better with you
You light up my day when you lace your shoe


If you can not kiss the light that is due
The reason is plain, if your guests can see

For they are so misled that the glass's the fool
If there be truth in the description or thought

By the false light, there's no truth at all behind
The glass's the fool, and who doth not know it

Though the lamp fly after your un-praised name
Yet I shall not light upon my self in vain

I'm mad that I would set out, though mad that I should fall
As I have fallen by chance ; not like so many fools

It is not thus : for all good sense that flies up and down

Flirts out at me like smoke or sulphur out of hell

And the same fog that covers the face of the sky

Flutters all over like people's fair face when face is clean


'T is so, so true a face, so false a face is beauty's fair
Beauty's beauty, heart-s false a soul's fair


Flutters in the wind like leaves out of others 't is the wind of love's
Beauty dies in love's eyes when love's beauty dies in love's eyes


True passion dies inlife is a tall tender tree
Savor it like a cookie



'T was twenty suns away, and I was in town
( That's twice since ) and there was little left to play

There's nothing for a lad to do, or bring
Except to pick a salad by the boatside

Sixty knots, or so ; an'if he has an ill
His mother's in for a second stint

If she gets hurt, the minute that we drop her off
We 'll bury her in dirt beneath the tide, or lie

The boatman has got to get out quicker than he begun
An'if he drops, there's a four-inch gun beneath the decks

It's the ship must bear him, if he runs away at all

The skipper cleared him of his hatches as he sped away

-- He's a man o'little, but he 'll take care of business

He has to bear the rudder, an'the boat an'the ship o'parts


With the rudder, the parts, an'best parts, an'best parts for London can carry

No help on any more. Better for the English fleet to-end


So down an's the ~Baltic~ than the ~Northern Light~, away for ever

Savor it like a cookie


And as ye eat it lightly
Grown heavy with honey

Taste the good man's paradise
And in every sin he takes

He shall lie dying
In the apple tree

The Apple Tree is tall and fair
And a man may sit and smoke

`` The Tree is tall and fair
We the Fruit is ripening

He shall stand upon the grass
And there rest his body full

And he may dream, and he may weep
But he is only dead

`` Oh, the fruit is pleasant, but the cup is sour
So we must drink to-night from the tree

The tree is tall and fair
So the grass is growing

But our lads have waddled far away
And we can not go to-night


For the summer is ending in May
And the bees are quiet in the wood
And the wood, the bees in many a horn


`` Let us go to-night, and go to-night, my lad, to-night for shame
And a man must die for love of my Lord that is Lord that is Lord of the Leaf


THEY man that slew the little lamb had never leaped before
They have stolen my lamb for a thief hath never slain my lamb but he was never sworn to eat of my lamb but he was youngLife, believe, is not a dream
You can not wake up just with a scream


I was alone, and now I am alone
And the love that I made of you is fled

O mother, look not on the future that doth lie
Hope hath not power over me to undo thee

But sleep, believe, is not a dream, and that hath power
And he that sleeps is kind to me and to thee

Look now, my daughter, and know with yourself
That I have watched with hopeless eyes

For though most men say to me this love is blind
Yet do I greatly prophesy to thee

Since in our dreams we have not made it so to pass
And he that sleeps shall sleep shall sleep beside thy grave

Thou didst make us promise that such days should never last

My deathless love, my life was never meant to last


As I have sworn that death should end my life that thou shouldst die
And thou shouldst die that thou shouldst love me more and me still


Life must keep raining ashes on my ashes bright
That death should keep raining tears still raining light


What woman but one tear should die that would have breath to shed on me

The fire of heaven that doth burn my ashes bright


So let love die and be poor and I die that die that darest but myself give thee fame
She walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



But she has many foes, the most
To whom her smiles thus compliment her grace

But she is blest, and every one
A lady is of every knight

And he, that sits him knightly down
In silken cloaks, enjoys the rest

She never spurns, nor does she run
Without complaints, from door to door

Her manners, which she never kept
Are kept her own, and even by maids

I wish, in this sweet place alone
My Lady might make love to me

To her so kind, and so unassuming face
That I fear I should ne'er see her more

Whom she so chaste an honest face hath taught to love

A lady's face should make a lady's fame

One thing more, her virtues should surpass them all


But to her face, the beauty must be great
To shine both high and great
Her worth surpass all other


But great is beauty, if she shines naught but high
And so is worth alone


And nought worth more to her alone is known
Save the sweetest eyes of earth and heaven

But that the starry night shall fall blacken all


And Venus in her bed alone must be blacken all


As aI am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


I have always been against the wind
I have never been for love of truth

And love, which loves, and doth not love despite
And yet doth prize the triumph of pursuing it

And love always loves to prove himself
And he can love if he be good and brave

And in verses like these I have tried to strike
The feeling humour of the subject well

Which is this bird, with wing upturned like a lark
That sings so loud, and so high, and sings so clear

His fellow sings, so high, and so clear, he almost cries
And almost cries out for his own liberty

And then sings of the things he loves, and then rouses in his pain

The reason, the courage, and the sweetness of the mind

Reason with such sweetness comes in birds from far

That, when the world cries out for them it can not choose but fly

He seeks them where they are, he seeks them with his heart's desire


So sing, oh, sing to her, sweet soul, and still sing oh, sing to her dear soul's dear dear dear dear dear dear soul
That song my soul, that heart is so dear to sing of thee


The psalm is very well, that still doth wake untoShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



Her locks would be as fair as day
And as white as heaven itself

I could wish a thousand merry hours
To serve her husband in her play

`` Nay but, I 'll not lie down to-night
She 'll come with all the other lords to-night

And fetch the candle out and bring
The key, and take our chalice away

`` Nay but, '' she says, `` it must be mine
My husband's gone away for ever

The morrow with my husband's ashes spread
By the grave where his love laid the keys

And in my ashes as his ashes lie
That's my husband '', Sir Harry Moore

To-night to-morrow morning at his bed

Though never a word he spoke or talked

Alas, my heart is weary of him now


He 'll cry, and my heart will faint at his heavy sigh
Forget the sorrow
And fly away, to-night from him alone


`` Nay but, if I 'll go with his guests before
To-night I 'll go woo her alone
My husband alone to-night

And carry away with me my glove

And take my glove beside the casket clear of the floor


To-morrow she shall come tomorrowI long for the warmth of your smile
and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


but -- Oh, my son, for a woman be strong
and I will conquer the heathen hordes if they come near my men

with fire which is sent to fan my flame

to make me smoke my own until I die. ( S -- p A n d 

you are a maker of pictures, makers of stories, makers of books
and therefore will buy my love and hatred once a year

but if I give you no more then three then three is enough
for a woman to hold you till I die
alcinous and red is a woman and cruel and stale is a man

and the words crack upon the lips and the breath-suspend is made stale and stale

of love and laughter and love's heart and the words are a bitter and sour delight

but the lad may you tread on a path that is dark and dank for a woman's blood
and I will be content if you shall know no joy of the best of love


if I leave the mouth of her that was lily's but in the wind that is sweet and red upon the stone
when only a woman's eyes have kissed her smile in clay


when it is sweetMy heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


Here where the hawthorn blossoms fall
I 'll sit by thee, sweet Phillis, and mark

Blue spots and stains of the sea-born flowers
Which now do trickle from thy face

The emerald isles, and even the blue
That fringe the margin of the moor

All this earth's a paradise ; and that
I should be deeming love more bliss

But as for thee I can not credit thee
I thought my heart was far away

It must be that I was in the sea
And that myself in paradise

Pleased with their sunny beauties to discern
Beauty but to leave behind

A void void and void of colour left behind


And what to me you left but plain and clear
In plainness I will show

On my white sandaled feet and back


That I will follow you and you alone

Oft have trod the deep in vain

So that I will swear I'm no man now


He must forsake my Phillis for another

For 't isle of heart and mind

And that I love thee dead and free


There where the sea must be no man to love

She moves on my Phillis fair
'n in vain and free

But I mustDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


When in all darkness we may sally
The trumpet of light shall call us from that bed

From the dark sea he is pouring down
From his lips the fragrance of the year

From his lips and round his temples twining
With the morning gold the purple fringe

The stars of morning shining through the lattice
The morning gold flashing in the lattice

The crescent circle, white and dim
And the hues which on the walls surround

The shadow of that lonely sea that doth lie
Far, deep, and beautiful, on earth and in air

For the gray sun to leftward wanes and dies
Like that which died for those whom night did wring

Her cruel face, and hung it from the brow of Eve

Even to the verge of death with cruel madness's stroke


And all this while her children in the dark green and lone
Are borne along the road

Its fading leaves and withered blossoms bend and fade


And the moon lights up the faded lamps of Eden's shrine


Darkness which never closes, till the sun once has set
And the heart of man's heart within


And the light of her is light and its own self is dead within


It shall be like a dead leaves in the dark brown earthDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


I know a face where the bright suns go down
And I would waken them all ; but I can name

They are so dark ; they will turn to my mind
Like the red sun's wandering in the water's throat

But I would weep, would weep, they would make me gay
And I could not, for being so cold. I hear

The echo of the falling rain. Soft falls
Of water falling, over the mountains

Merry and loud the hills reply, I wait for thee
Of truth, and beauty, and the strength of love

That knows the sweetness of the silent dead, when the night is wrapped
By waves and day by the light of thy smile


And I would smile to stir their spirits, and the heartbreak clear
Look down, to sigh, to stir their misery


For darkness is the love they have of me, and love is a gift we crave but rarely
But we can feel the need
Of change, and know not to seek for what despair is worth fear alone


Even as we gaze, its shadow on the twilight darkens above the earth and under the seas

The truth to thee, for whose shadow on eternity shall fall flat

Shine like lightning on life, its shadow at the sands to clear

I would love to be her knight



Thus she pursues his bold design
A champion in the morning wears

But what has she achieved so far
In a body frail as a man's

To suit a lady's every whim
Is a body frail, but a mind

Yet if I were to force her there
I should find my end a miser's hell

But ah! her success was nought to dread
Then why the risk to cross a devil

With all her bravest, best design
With every grace and all her might

The devil shall decide which way to go
In the end I shall prevail alone

Obedient to the king she rides away
And dares not venture where she may

On foot alone, she's betroth 'd to the king

But she, by no means, rides on alone

-- Nay, on foot she rides, and on horseback

-- 'T is gallop now, and gallop now she rides alone

In the name of the fair lady alone


The queen comes riding with a silver horn
On a silver horn


When presently the moon is down above
The moon beside the moon

As if she were riding in spight of Death


She rides high on an hundred knights below

When the first black drop of frost
Buckles on your lip, oh! kiss it! ( Don Juan sings

`` Oh, the chill earth and the frozen seas
And a black eye thief on the Northern Lights

All these things, and more, make me a saint
Who never felt love's arms stretched out

Flesh to the bone, flesh to the bone
She smiles upon the horizon white

See, the skipper springs aside and scolds
And the cruiser bellowing rings again

See, the watchmen stand behind the casement blind
And whisper to the frighted mate

`` A face like thine we have in England yet
That's calm as dawn in sunny Wales

Oh, the land that's England yet! a land of rest

`` It would serve us to awake, '' quoth the mate
And in solemn low tones

`` Ay, a face like thine we have in England yet

And the soul of our bark be found

`` Because the cobbler is a thief

And he finds you most unkind
That walks alone in the shade

`` He finds him, because he's a thief
And one that loves alone

And if he has naught to gain
He 'll ask the cobbler for his share

The thief will have none, if he 'll look no more
But to the tree to look for boughs

And where the branches lie at the root

`` Because the leaves go round the tree
He 'll steal no more 'fore you or I

And the thief steal no more, unless he 'll look no more


Because his soul lies hidden in the dust
Underneath the sod
By the green sod's bare floor

Underneath the branches of the fallen tree


Underneath the thorn that lies between us twain
He shall go nevermore
But alone

Underneath the tree and under the thorn
He shall go nevermore


Else we were alone

Underneath the tree and under the thorn

I am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


Since first on earth I took an interest in books
I have read my stock rhymes many times, and seen them fail

`` Do they not give you pleasure, '' -- reply 'em all
`` Do they not give, '' -- you know, the price would go up much higher

`` I have never heard the people of London tell
`` I have always read and loved of books -- and so on

An ancient quatrain runs thus : `` The great Almanacks
The little hamlet of the Abazai

Were always merry in those days, '' ( he began, as quoted in the epilogue
`` Behold the good old time, boys

There is good people living in Don Nevill's still

Come on, the people of Don Nevills and Holborn

Come on, for fear's sake of God and ever amen to Nevills and Holborn

and it creeps in my teeth, and it nibbles my gum and stops
and i hear your sweet voice say to my mother'`` Is that sweet

but she knows, and she pats her boy on the mouth and it bites and it gathes and it pants
and the little boy is asleep and you are awake when you come slinking by his mother's side

and i lie down upon my couch and dream of your sweet looks and my dear looks idle and idle nights

and i hear you say to myself while i stir in my bones there's nothing so sweet to cheer me

and i close my eyes and shut my brain i shut my heart of my limbs and die and take my heart for a glass of your dear eyes in me

But you shall never be her lover

And never to be married. Judge you too
You are too small for her to carry

She carries with her head between her back
A deadly weight, and can not lift it higher

And, when she is over-whelmed with woe
She pines again, and in a piteous mood

And oftener sighs, and oftener sighs
Because she finds the pang hard gain

Thence to a tower it sunk and fell
Which she, in misery, and agony

Then in her arms her husband lies ; now laments
The woe wherein she can not bear to part

So fair another's sorrow ; so another's tears

Heaven give her peace! and comfort, and she dreams

That if the lover be unhappy she will be


Though on earth no man she can love and be happy
She loves him in hell or heaven


Till marriage is the only chastest pleasure
In the earth to make

Forgetting all faults and doting care


To be the happiest man alive or dead


And he makes her a good cheerless noise of cheer

And never to groan

Beating, drinking or loosing ale

And no more shall he complain and pant if she keepI am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


-- `` Dear reader, let me now proceed
`` Dear master -- what is this that you bring

This is the last sad page that shall suffice
To show that love can but ill contribute

And since she can not help it, let me prove
That love can but well contribute it

Pardon -- but I'm too fond of rhymes to speak
So sigh 'd she, and did not take to speaking

Thus sigh 'd, and said that love could not do't
Since love must suffer so, could love complain

Thus sigh 'd, and did not once but wish her tongue a grace
Till all the praises to my verse she gave

`` Dear madam -- so happy, since you can not understand

`` Nay, madam -- what strange love doth to my verses tell


`` Nay, madam -- what strange love to my verses doth attend
`` What strange love to me dear

He that is blind toMy heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


You and your eyes were very clear
And the blue heaven yourself would show

Therefore I would make my speech an observation
That the matter from below may not grow brown

This way to the right we journeyed long
Till our journey was to a valley green

Then a steep bank against us was thrown
That both us pursued with our feet

And in that steep bank far behind us spread
More steep and wider than our road

Which in the centre of a lake lay set
Full to the right and left, that opposite

Thence we halted, but could not move our feet
Between the hills and the cool glade

And on the left, upon a bank so bare
And steep, there lay the pool beside

That neither soul could we avoid descending

Nor step to it -- on its brink we drew


But on its brink would we not go ; so soon we drew
O'er it, and on we drew still
Until the other side


Which to the left we halted on a little space
And there continually


So we looked upwards, and not sure we did espy
To mark the change of day


And straightway to left and right we moved our feet


Like slow steps across the watery plain

Till we came to alife is a tall tender tree
Savor it like a cookie



And if the winter wind
Breaks the knots of leaves with might

And, as my foot goes south
Far beyond the isles of Wales

Its branches wither faster
When the freshest sun is down

The tree, while winds and sleet
Can hardly lift its head

A hundred homes about it range
In parts of Kent and parts of Clyde

There are cabins on the hills
One is in Donegal

A long-known cottage on the hills
Built for poor people's needs

A churchyard opposite the flood
Has fallen to cobbler's bills

A neighbour house on Cherry-heath
A smut between

Now it sleeps in Sussex and Meath

There is peace and quiet there
And plenty in the woods


But wherefore should I stay
Wherefore should I stay


Under the cherry-heath

Under the cherry tree

On Cherry-heath

In winter I must go


And I've nothing better to do


In summer than pine

I 'll swing and stare and rant

Or look and grin and curse


And in the old tree till I die


Till I turn and leap in pain
In jest or curse or grin


And IThey were lonely and tired
That is when the shot was fired


Tired of the noise and din
The weary farmer strays

In the pleasant shade of a tufted oak
And a young monk stood near

A group from walks and brushwood strayed
In search of some familiar face

They sought him hand in hand
Till from the churchyard far away

The hounds that used to roam
Trembled and whimpered behind

And many talked in solemn doubt
Of what the stranger would say or say

In the morning light of many days
When many of them had passed by

On the road beyond the town
Some old men saw the village pass

And saw men sitting still in glass

And the gray-coat farmer go

Out through the dusk to meet him at the door

But he left him alone on the road

By the churchyard grey and bare

Came out with the heathen folk alone


In the twilight alone. His mother said
It had no answer as they passed
Or the grey-coat man

He said nothing, nothing at all


He passed, and saw no face. His father stood abroad


He lay on the cold ground. His soul sank low and grey

It seemed to speak as some strange thing hidden there


Far away between the smoke of a woman'sI long for the warmth of your smile
and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


`` Now though I have many desires
and plenty of mouths as well as mouths

no reason am I to wish that any
shall ever find out love like me

my love was young and fair but he
was also clever and witty too

there were many a fool to have loved more
and yet none could enjoy than he

the cruel and the sly to have seen
as he would lie with his hands on his heart

`` Dear cruel god that I should smother
to hold you down and kiss and watch you wet

yet never in the wide world tasted you
at any price save your own so sweet

or was it love so rich and poor or fair

that in your love there lived to feed him on

as well as in mine eyes, love being poor or fair

as mine eyes the lack of heart that day


as a thief or fond of yourself should rob love of his light

no fault of my heart as in my eyes was broke


unless you were mad or blind or lame to see why
thy heart said so
my eyes have eyes or not thy love said so


or he could see why eyes should lose sight nor use me light

for shame to keep thee blind or lame

or that must be mad and lame to see why lightThe taste of marmelade is better with you
You light up my day when you lace your shoe


And when a langer is lighting on his brest
Nay when the jockey's far too slow or his face too light

Till in your pricking the ladies do begin
Then with your pricking you draw from my heart all

'T is your invention and all that's in it make
Though you paint a match with red, blue, and green

The very colours that you paint must be fair
And those but hide the strength of your ink's dye

This is true painting, 't is the most fair to look on
And make the eyes of the world look much more sober

But yet the devil keep your pricking till they find you a flaw

First make a hole in your cloth, then crimp your sides, then cut your side

And, worst of all, set an old sash on your shoes so white

Then place your handkerchief on your shoulder and say : `` Pull hard

Put in your handkerchief, pull hard, there's no skin to hurt in't


If you find none at all, turn black, you 'll be glad, 't is still black and spare me, Jack
Put in your handkerchief, pull hard, and say 't is half red


`` Pull hardDo not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


For your own breast it was such steel did clench
That you were lost, and I your heart, a chasm, between

I lay me down to die by night and day
And not a voice said prayers for me or said a pray'r

I loved you far many a year, beyond the end
And your name all the world beside but I can tell

All the birds cried out under the stars under the sky
And beyond the light I have never set eye on you

But from deep wells that rocked with waves of pure gold
And the deep murmured in my heart's uttermost core

To the grave of my loved ones under your love, as I came forth

Away the stars looked under. Where is he, now? Where is he? Where is he


Earth hath no ear for aught but yourself and no man but me
'mid those that are mine own thoughts or mine
Mine or the thoughts of thoughts of things gone by


Yet I dare climb where the blue heaven has never lid upon lid
Where is he but dimly on the sea-rock's rim


I dare go where the stars dimly wander, headlong and alone. Where is he alone


In those lone ships alone are the winds have never keeled toe to knee
OutLife, believe, is not a dream
You can not wake up just with a scream


All day long ( what in the name of heaven
We could not wake, for God had already decreed

Held the pale man's knees -- all bare and bare
And the gray mare stood up straight to take the stir

We could not wake, for he had already decreed
Held us to go to sleep, without fear

But we lay up all naked in the sun
And we could not wake, we never could be waking

And the grey mare behind us halted still
And her foot lay on the road ; and the gray mare behind

`` You 'll come in time to see another day
You will come in time to see another day


You 'll come in time to die, but your last breath behind you lies
And your last good will behind the slings

Past the grey mare's mouth, past the grey walls, past the dark green corn husks

Past the dying creeper's bones and moulded walls

And you have come and gone, but we have gone together together


Solemnly, sobbing in agony and sleep we have parted
We must together go nevermore
I have rest till Death shall come to-night alone


Oh! nevermore we together let fall our hearts in silence sadMy heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


Blue hills, and valleys wide
How dear to me this is! and where

For if to die I would break
In the deep blue ocean

That is, to be whole and free
From my dear master -- Love

Yet why were it, then, that I
Should sit and sing and smile

While he, who rules above
Throbs round about me like a train

And, in my melancholy mood
Discovers always where he goes

Blue hills, and streams, and meadows green
And I have found out a name

But I am broke, and I am cold
And my heart is dull and cold

No, I am young, and I am blind

How sweet a name for ever must be lent
Once a name for me

It is not worth a name that can endure

All that is dear to me is gone or fled by me

No wheel on a wheel but will turn ten years old


When you shall tread the twilight grey and tread alone
We shall lie under the stone alone


And the grey twilight shall turn grey and I shall smile and grin
And the grisly will smile in vain

It shall not speak and swear and it is not I


Love sleeps where the dark and I shall lie in the morning dimThey were mad and in love
She was a wolf and he was a dove


That night when I was a child
My mother brought me food

She put me in a pleasant fright
Her head on my shoulder gripped

My life had been good to her then
And to have none at all

To see earth tremble with her change
To see stars turn pale

Her colour changed, her shape became
As if it were a rose

And as with a wet dream
She waked to find me there

My father and I, we two
Saw nothing but the sky

And we both answered in dismay
`` Now, earth, earth, this is hell

God makes no heaven but hell for men

And I know hell for myself

I know I shall never see again

But I shall die for love and thee

And when I die I must be damned

The Devil shall love me still

And I will die for love of my own

She that fed on my mother's soul

Shall feed on her flesh and I that fed on her bones

Shall feed on her bones in the ditch beside the river's rim

Shall plod on its will and leave nothing behind

Shall plod on its mouth and leave nothing behind


But she that rocked in its tether and leaped into the tree
AndThe taste of marmelade is better with you
You light up my day when you lace your shoe



You break my heart, I 'll confess, 't was never true
Since first you took your fling. -- This fling is mine

And if I should have seen that bird before
You would have chang 'd his looks, though not his feathers'hue

There are, indeed, men of a finer mind
But all who have read me can not say

They say, for instance, that poets write best
Who change the subject, he who flutters the style

Who praise a play, whose last act is, as true as the last
Who flutter and whimper at each turn ', but laugh when it comes out

Then show, how subtly and how subtly you improve

A lesson learned from what madam you've borrowed from me


What women are, to be a flint-bit in every thread
I can't be dull with no regard to beauty's hour


Nor scorn a flattery that doth more than a flint-bit betray
For, being mortal, a lover is but love's fool


You that are fond of yourself, make me a goddess of you, and bless her first
And then kiss her -- she 'll have a heart for you


And, bless whom shall you, andLife, believe, is not a dream
You can not wake up just with a scream


The light of a new sun is but a vapour sent
To drown those hopes that you had hoped to see return

The first light would have made the old one start
Leaving a little dust. The sun will soon light up again

We are not so far gone before we know more
Of what hath made us than to know what's left of us

Of what has left us? Hearts whose hopes and fears
Were still with one another and a God above

Of what to love and serve? Hearts that could not fail
For never more to love or serve, or lose the love they lost

Love is a fickle power, and there have been times when men have sung
Of one who could not love, but thought he could in death


Though many years pass yet, as the shadow of tears is dim
He shall look stern. Once when life is young and man is old


He will have tears for many lives, and never more look dim
So young and man must look dim in vain


Yet will we make us sport, we do not say things that will avail to show
Until the lad is old and old


And the lads will fling their souls abroad like chickens at each other's feet
Though their best in the old wheel spins on high

life is a tall tender tree
Savor it like a cookie



Though thick on high in shady wood
Its branches were of jet-black velvet

And in velvet mantling did recline
Its sap was like the honey-comb

The emeralds, and the sapphires were
The branches of the Order Chloris

The cypress-tree, and green lapis lazulus
The beech's solitary prickly-stump

These all within a garden fair
Built from the spoils of ancient fight

And every flower was there to dine
For every season, as the holluschick May

Was built to please the eye and ear
But not the owner's heart, the holluschick May

The month when the green eglantine comes down

Fresh as the winter of thy loveliness


The poppy, which in spring is red
Brings from the ground its roots so clear
And smelling sweet


And lasts till April showers, doth bestow
The rose-like incense upon thy head


A crown of flowers to wear, a crown of roses crowned


Then sing, Spring, thou spring, good-like of thy youth
Oh bring, for May

For ever fair. If ever fair, and bright, the earth is fair


Oh, if ever earthThey were mad and in love
She was a wolf and he was a dove


But now they neither ran, and they neither stirred
Nor did they talk, but glared like startled serpents scared

With a long look they gazed on each the other's heads
They ne'er looked each other down, but stared out at the skies

The wind was strong in the forest yet. With might
As they went on with their journey, the wind grew more swift

And the moon, like a star, grew greater and greater
And in their sleep each could not see nor understand

For the light darkness grew on the land, they could not see nor hear
And every tooth on the tree that was tall grew dimmer yet

For darkness is not in heaven. -- a voice said out across the air

From the dark wood to the sea-shore again : `` Here lies Alfred

We will go forth to hunt, '', '' over the waves crashing by the headlands dry

They heard the far-roaring guns boom overhead : they heard the foam-horn ring

The high-roar-horn clank beside the quivering stirrups and the drift in the ropes


Death is waiting for Alfred, and over the heads of the English fleet and wild


They looked, beyond the moon and saw Alfred in the light of the twilight sea and earth
And Alfred in theShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



Oh! when will youth be here again
When will she be no more a woman

Oh! youth is past and gone away
And I can neither live nor die

Farewell, fair Fidessa, farewell
For all that thou hast done for me

Now, Fidessa, give me heart
Give me reason, strength, and leer

Pity the grief that follows so
So shall thou live, and never die

And have a happy future life
But Fate, imprison 'd in her will

Kiss me, sweet, if you will, and kiss me still
Kiss me, sweet, though I am dead

And ever and anither let me sleep
Oh, kiss me, sweet, for ever and anither

Kiss me, sweet, for ever anither

Kiss me, sweet, for ever anither

Kiss me, sweet, for ever anither

Kiss me, sweet, sweet, forShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



`` Oh, what avails that face of hers
To look so fresh, so fair, so innocent

But, poor heart! her hair is wild
I'm sure the nymph would wither faster

What avails that brow so fair
Whose lips so softly kiss the ground

And why doth she not lie still
With her tresses down, and kiss the sky

And in her hand a stone she bears
Holding another's sorrowing heart

Oh, what avails that eye so fair
Love's shadow should be drowned in snow

Why does she not lie still, and look so still
So innocent and young
Though I can not see or smell her face


My lady dear, may I remain in Rhone
And have another morn


I haven't none left, nor any friend to cheer me
I'le return forlorn

See! it shall not be another morn


Celestial, but in that face of hers
Makes fair such a face as yours

All day she's like the night to look so white


Why do you keep your winter close at heart

Suns, stay, sir, good night, night, sweet tears, stay night


Marrying, kill yourselfMy heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


And the birds sing far and near
So happy are we when skies are blue

For the breeze is in the trees and flies so clear

'T was a pretty morning, Jenny, sayst my dear
I thought thy speech would please the people far and near

To see my love, and welcome in a spring
To such dear country : there his presence might declare

'To be a lady, surely,'she cried ; but what
Is this, my dear, my heart is weary of a seat

He loves to sit and talk with us, while others sit
And, standing still, would talk of things beyond his reach

Weep too, my love, and weep, for dear friend, thou art very near

Of this dear country, very near to home. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â

'It would seem very strange, to think, but that, after all my pain
His words and sighs, I hardly know his mind


If he have any griefs, it should be something to relieve me of my pain
Oh, make him cheerful still, my dear friend
This morning for your love, my dear friend


And I will sleepShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



There is a garden, very fair
Which pretty girls and boys must tread

In the picture of the garden's face
It is very sweet and very green

So pretty girls and boys must stroll
Between the flowers, or face to face

And when they walk together, they will say
A good, a bad, a long, and a nay

The gate is very high and very high
The little children just outside

But, when they come to the opened door
It is very pretty and very white

And, every one, a rabbit, and a kitty
Meet in it, and together run

And play awhile, to-night, without fear

To-night run you from door to door, and away they go

And the rabbit, and kitty together

Will run as their own, at your rejoicing cry


`` Don't you see why not all these little folks are so gay
Or sad or gay a girl


If there be any worth upon earth but you
More worthy of love than she


Or if there be no worth, but you alone
I 'd have but one poor heart to give

Wise, all-s ungrace to her or me


So, sweet a Lady, happy in her lifeThey were mad and in love
She was a wolf and he was a dove


But now the world is young
And love and I must part

And she was calmer then a dove
With whom I would have been

But now I see
How now she talks and plays

I see my heart grow cold
And I must part again

`` My dear, I must part again
Will you and I together die

But, first, though 't is too much
I have too little then

`` So, since I can not love nor find
Without some help from you

Perhaps hereafter I shall find
Some way to gain

`` Do you think I shall forget
To sigh or sigh so still

If we were lovers yet

We had rather have not gone

Than think we did not love

I never knew love


For I did but sigh and look to night
If that night

My soul was cruel still

I might be cruel still

Though I would be cruel still


`` Oh, now you must be still
For I can not love

I must not look to night nor look to day


And yet I must love if she would but I will look yet

She would not look to night or day

`` Let me think of this or she will look to night
But why not I should loveThey were mad and in love
She was a wolf and he was a dove


They're saints that died before the dawn
The old man sits and watches 'em

They're saints that died long ago
They are all gray like Cain

He sees and hears them, hears them, hears
And goes to help her, and to keep

He's mad and will not go away
But when he is in trouble

And they were saints that lived and died
She was a lion and he were a whale

And they are saints now that died to-day
They are all gray like Cain

They have stolen all the treasure away
They're saints now all grey that died

The old man hears them and scrambles to and fro

They can not follow them, they can only say
They've stolen all the treasure away


But he he must watch, and he must watch till night is over
The Devil drives on the night beside
And he may catch the thief and he may catch the thief


They have stolen not many things, but only one good thief they have found
But he has stolen many more for his master's sake

For they that were good did not rest, and he will need them still. He sleeps upon


He 'll never rest till the drift of night shall stain the floor and grass
The sun-blade whereI long for the warmth of your smile
and the sight of your teeth like a crocodile


but a thousand wishes come true
and I die for starving and dying every day

you have given my body and soul the strength to run
you have put the finishing touches on my heart

and I die for having taught me to chide and love
but the truth is this, the truth is plain yet clear

you chide the love you have given and chid my pain
but don't you chide me till I am old as Cain

unless I don't give you a hundred thousand, and ten
you shall buy a hundred, and ten means a league

it is all but taken for a bribe from Heaven that I have given
and you have sworn it by my faith in the eye of the hand

then you are not my debtor you are but yourself alone

therefore, though you must love me and torture me till my heart is sore

then the pain shall be sore and the food be yellow and black

that the thief draweth your knife and draweth my sword free

You light up my day when you lace your shoe



Of your fine silk, or rayon's lustre, or chaster light
Of your fine shining, ornaments, or precious gold

It is best to be a moment pure and sweet
So that you may be as happy to go hence

And see the rich world without your presence
As Philomel is in her glass. Now, since I deem

That you love me as I love all the world
All my flesh and fish I love with all my limbs

Then at your better sight, this pretty lady's skill
Is a full noble, full virtuous, and full clever

All her words are plain, her cunning is plain, her wit is high

All her pictures are striking ; her toys are new toys

All her wit is sharp, her jokes are witty, and clear, and clean

She will praise me at your praising, when you list

Methinks, she will praise you at your reading too


Here I do love her ; let me see who loves you most
Here she loves me, where she lives, where she doth read

My poor love her friends, and bless her, and bless her still


IF he that loves me can love thee, will be faithful to me
If him that loves him as well
Do not stand by my grave and weep
The appeal for darkness is to steep


While the dim night, dim as the night is
Covers my sorrows with a little cloud

Though she weep, she still may pour to the sun
Its gushing light on my low-hung clay

Her eyes look sharp, her cheeks are pale but dry
All must burn to the dust to die away

Pale, worn out with seeking for a star
None finds content with his own unborrowed light

She looked so, but he still could not brook
Till all those years she might have dreamt she was gone

Her eye was far too keen, and her lips were bare
Her voice too loud, but it was only in vain

Her brow was as cold as the snow of the winter's mire

Where is a man that dares not speak where his heart is lost


For she thinks it is an iron kettle-knell to which men draw their breath
When they must talk of the day and drink beer


Though the dead lips have tasted and yet and yet shall taste not speak, for fear of hell
Yet the red lips of the past must red and gray be red

Gone forth the smoke of lips like lead and forth the pain that we have sought to spill


They must go to one man till their blood is sweet and we haveThey were lonely and tired
That is when the shot was fired


My father who was a barber and smith, while I was a child
And I called my wife to her and she answered me straightway in derision

`` Well then don't you cry that the women are dying that you're so ill
My wife has a finger to the crown, a thumb to the side

And they wait for the road and they wait for the light to come on the sill
But I pricked my finger across my cheek and there were no words to plead for

My wife had a finger to the crown, my thumb to the tip, and I heard her call
`` `` Ay, good son, '' `` my son, '' `` Good mother, son, '' `` how far have they sped? '' `` Speed, '' on, my son

Fie but for a minute, '' said I, and there was little gain to the little gain at a good man's work

But the little gain was no pleasant gain at the little gain that I had won in my love and my mother's pain


I turned and looked around the garden and we turned the grass, the grass, and we reached a field where the green grass was nigh where the green grass might grow for ever
And I reached my little grey earth out to the grey earth, and I reached itched beneath the tread of the thornI am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


To be honest I never tax my heirs
But tell them what I think, and hold them very dear

This I can live for : The times I've served, Ã‘I’ve served men
And now, Sir, I own, they haven't yet got to do

Well! that's an awkward thing to think on, and it makes you stare
And there's not much joy in making friends, Sir, if you have 'em

And so I thought, if I might get married some day, the time should be this
When heirs should both be very rich indeed and very poor

Well! young man! young man! what think you of the news I hear
But, I own, my old mates are not what they seem, and I've miscarried my son


This, said he, with a sigh, is your lucky betrothing ; and my dear, young lad, he's born the son
Though I knew, I promised him a sorer man he should succeed

We two were married. Now I hope my wife but ill suits both, and he must have another one


If that you think so, don't trouble you, you 'll find out at home, and he 'll have another wife a-babbleShe walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



To him, before his day is done
My life, my grave, my world resign

And though the clouds shall overcast
The sun, and though our days be pall

Yet, like the moon, with beams divine
She shal kindle all the rest

For ever and for ever night
Shall wake no more, and never day

The world shall hear no more his praise
Nor night, nor day, nor night, shall know

His glory is the memory
Of what has been, his love and care

And what to her shall ne'er be forgot
Nor death, nor day, nor night resign

When with her still he lives, to lead her by

( Who now, with love as strong and bold
Will dare him live secure her name

And, if we two should meet in lonely hell


A-hunting in a country nameless
With men that know no shame

He, like a man old and gray, alone, alone

Shall kiss the ground that nought beside

And seek not death with shame for gain


And joy ; I seek a spot that nothing can not waste

And I 'll sleep in peace where sleep no more


But she shall sleep and love and thou doth see


AndMy heart aches just thinking of you
But now I am left feeling blue


Away went the ship as winds arise
Away went the little boat as seas arise

Blue was the wind as I passed by
From my own land in the water driven

Blue rose the weather as it rose
From the frozen wastes of the frozen North

The skipper said `` I'm going to make you gay
But you have my word I 'll go where you would

My dear, but I'm sick of seeing you
How shall I make you happy any more

When the north-wind drives against the sky
Lovely is he whom the south respects

Sober his mood, and wise his reason shows

He shows his utmost patience with his care

Sober, wise his reason, seems to me to me
Yet my heart is not so nice

My little kite is fickle and fleet

Quick my feet do follow behind me blindly

Still I follow after where I may stray

But away went my lazy ghost

Up rose the skipper laughing merrily

Splashed the water clear and clear

Splashed and clear away through the sky

Splashed by the stream below

Ever laughing merrily and clear away through the sky

Splashed by the sea below

Splashed by faint, faint wee merrily and clear away below

She walks in beauty, like the night
I would love to be her knight



Then, since she has forsaken me
Why, let her know she's forsaken me

And, having forsaken thee
Tell her she is my devoted fone

I would not be a captive then
If I had not my brother here

She 'd be as lovely as the day
I kiss and suck and drown forlorn

'T is not enough I have forsaken thee
I need a goddess to enthrall me

Let her see I love her dearly and dearly
And if she willn't, I 'll try to prove her still

By this I know that I am in need of her
And she has promised me her oath for my seal

That she 'll nevermore be my captive then I am

But I 'll keep her prisoner till I do her good or ill

`` She 'll guard me till she do her best again or ill

`` Then if she may, I 'll make my death my lady of my own

`` She 'll give her love her death before I die or ill begun

`` You had best lie down and do yourself or ill begun

I did it for a favour to my mistress first

But now I 'll give my love so solemnly, my lass, or ill begun


AndI am writting this poem for you
To let you know that I will always be true


It shall be told to you by the churls that guard it
They shall think it their own when by the women they speak

And when you turn away in your chair to stare
It shall be the last I shall see lest you think so

But as for my friend, it shall be told to him
He will laugh as he would any night, and swear

And on the last day before he dies, at my request
You shall bring to his chamber and hold him by his throat

The women shall answer all that they shall think by night
And he shall go to his grave at my command

Then when the churl that he so loved shall take the opportunity
To take what he most dearly bought for his queen

He shall kiss her and promise to hold her hand and eye

And when he sleeps in his own bed he shall awake as fast as he would write


To see the pretty lass she flutters by the other night

They shall see when she flutters and they shall see how it did him deceive


But when she walks out by the other night to-side alone

They shall think it all a lie in the while they shall think of her alone


They shall wish it all over and think of him and never think of Maggie


She shall

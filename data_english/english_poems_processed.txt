Heart , that you 're weeping yet for Paradise
Do they still whisper , the old weary cries

Exile of immortality , strongly wise
Strain through the dark with undesirous eyes

I cower to the earth , I waking , I only
High and cold thou dreamest , O queen , high-dreaming and lonely

The white one flame , and the night-long crying
The viewless passers ; the world 's low sighing

With desire , with yearning
To the fire unburning

To the heatless fire , to the flameless ecstasy
Helpless I lie

And around me the feet of thy watchers tread
There is a rumour and a radiance of wings above my head

All the earth grows fire
White lips of desire

Dewy paths full of comfort . And radiant bands
The gracious presence of friendly hands

Help the blind one , the glad one , who stumbles and strays
Stretching wavering hands , up , up , through the praise

And heard the waves , and the seagull 's mocking cry
And in them all was only the old cry

O silly lover
And I was tired and sick that all was over

For all my thinking , never could recover
One moment of the good hours that were over

Then from the sad west turning wearily
I saw the pines against the white north sky

Their sharp black heads against a quiet sky
And there was peace in them ; and I

And laughed , and did no longer wish to die
Being glad of you , O pine-trees and the sky

Through unknown glooms , that frail black coffin -- and therein
God 's little pitiful Body lying , worn and thin

Till it was no more visible ; then turned again
With sorrowful quiet faces downward to the plain

The crowd 's good laughter , the loved eyes of men
I am drawn nightward ; I must turn again

She was wrinkled and huge and hideous ? She was our Mother
She was lustful and lewd ? -- but a God ; we had none other

In the day She was hidden and dumb , but at nightfall moaned in the shade
We shuddered and gave Her Her will in the darkness ; we were afraid

She was hungry and ate our children ; -- how should we stay Her
She took our young men and our maidens ; -- ours to obey Her

We were loathed and mocked and reviled of all nations ; that was our pride
She fed us , protected us , loved us , and killed us ; now She has died

What light of unremembered skies
Hast thou relumed within our eyes

Thou whom we seek , whom we shall find
A certain odour on the wind

Thy hidden face beyond the west
These things have called us ; on a quest

Older than any road we trod
More endless than desire.Far God

Sigh with thy cruel voice , that fills
The soul with longing for dim hills

And faint horizons ! For there come
Grey moments of the antient dumb

Sickness of travel , when no song
Can cheer us ; but the way seems long

And one remembers Ah ! the beat
Of weary unreturning feet

And songs of pilgrims unreturning
The fires we left are always burning

On the old shrines of home . Our kin
Have built them temples , and therein

Pray to the Gods we know ; and dwell
In little houses lovable

Being happy ( we remember how
And peaceful even to death O Thou

God of all long desirous roaming
Our hearts are sick of fruitless homing

And crying after lost desire
Hearten us onward ! as with fire

Consuming dreams of other bliss
The best Thou givest , giving this

Sufficient thing -- to travel still
Over the plain , beyond the hill

Unhesitating through the shade
Amid the silence unafraid

Till , at some sudden turn , one sees
Against the black and muttering trees

Thine altar , wonderfully white
Among the Forests of the Night

Come away ! Come away
Ye are sober and dull through the common day

It is shameful night , and God is asleep
( Have you not felt the quick fires that creep

The house is dumb
The night calls out to you . Come , ah , come

Naked , crawling on hands and feet
-- It is meet ! it is meet

But Love was as a flame about my feet
Proud up the Golden Stair I strode ; and beat

One of them wakes , and spits , and sleeps again
The darkness shivers . A wan light through the rain

Strikes on our faces , drawn and white . Somewhere
A new day sprawls ; and , inside , the foul air

Is chill , and damp , and fouler than before
Opposite me two Germans sweat and snore

Ah ! the long road ! and you so far away
Oh , I 'll remember ! but . . . each crawling day

Some day I shall rise and leave my friends
And seek you again through the world 's far ends

You whom I found so fair
( Touch of your hands and smell of your hair

My eager feet shall find you again
Though the sullen years and the mark of pain

Have changed you wholly ; for I shall know
( How could I forget having loved you so

In the sad half-light of evening
The face that was all my sunrising

So then at the ends of the earth I 'll stand
And hold you fiercely by either hand

And seeing your age and ashen hair
I 'll curse the thing that once you were

Because it is changed and pale and old
( Lips that were scarlet , hair that was gold

And I loved you before you were old and wise
When the flame of youth was strong in your eyes

And turn , and toss your brown delightful head
Amusedly , among the ancient Dead

Pleasure 's not theirs , nor pain . They doubt , and sigh
And do not love at all . Of these am I

One last shame 's spared me , one black word 's unspoken
And I 'm alone ; and you have not awoken

When love has changed to kindliness
Oh , love , our hungry lips , that press

Nodding in heaven , and whisper stuff
Seven million years were not enough

Less than the breath of children playing
A blasphemy scarce worth the saying

Tendered in habit ( once a flame
All heaven sang out to ) wakes the shame

We 'll have , -- THAT day , what shall we do
Being so noble , kill the two

That time when all is over , and
Hand never flinches , brushing hand

And blood lies quiet , for all you 're near
And it 's but spoken words we hear

Where trumpets sang ; when the mere skies
Are stranger and nobler than your eyes

And flesh is flesh , was flame before
And infinite hungers leap no more

In the chance swaying of your dress
And love has changed to kindliness

In a cool curving world he lies
And ripples with dark ecstasies

The kind luxurious lapse and steal
Shapes all his universe to feel

And know and be ; the clinging stream
Closes his memory , glooms his dream

Who lips the roots o ' the shore , and glides
Superb on unreturning tides

Those silent waters weave for him
A fluctuant mutable world and dim

Where wavering masses bulge and gape
Mysterious , and shape to shape

Dies momently through whorl and hollow
And form and line and solid follow

Solid and line and form to dream
Fantastic down the eternal stream

An obscure world , a shifting world
Bulbous , or pulled to thin , or curled

Or serpentine , or driving arrows
Or serene slidings , or March narrows

There slipping wave and shore are one
And weed and mud . No ray of sun

But glow to glow fades down the deep
( As dream to unknown dream in sleep

Shaken translucency illumes
The hyaline of drifting glooms

The strange soft-handed depth subdues
Drowned colour there , but black to hues

As death to living , decomposes
Red darkness of the heart of roses

Blue brilliant from dead starless skies
And gold that lies behind the eyes

The unknown unnameable sightless white
That is the essential flame of night

Lustreless purple , hooded green
The myriad hues that lie between

Darkness and darkness ! . And all 's one
Gentle , embracing , quiet , dun

The world he rests in , world he knows
Perpetual curving . Only -- grows

An eddy in that ordered falling
A knowledge from the gloom , a calling

Weed in the wave , gleam in the mud
The dark fire leaps along his blood

Dateless and deathless , blind and still
The intricate impulse works its will

His woven world drops back ; and he
Sans providence , sans memory

Unconscious and directly driven
Fades to some dank sufficient heaven

O world of lips , O world of laughter
Where hope is fleet and thought flies after

Of lights in the clear night , of cries
That drift along the wave and rise

Thin to the glittering stars above
You know the hands , the eyes of love

The strife of limbs , the sightless clinging
The infinite distance , and the singing

Blown by the wind , a flame of sound
The gleam , the flowers , and vast around

The horizon , and the heights above
You know the sigh , the song of love

But there the night is close , and there
Darkness is cold and strange and bare

And the secret deeps are whisperless
And rhythm is all deliciousness

And joy is in the throbbing tide
Whose intricate fingers beat and glide

In felt bewildering harmonies
Of trembling touch ; and music is

The exquisite knocking of the blood
Space is no more , under the mud

His bliss is older than the sun
Silent and straight the waters run

The lights , the cries , the willows dim
And the dark tide are one with him

How can we find ? how can we rest ? how can
We , being gods , win joy , or peace , being man

We , the gaunt zanies of a witless Fate
Who love the unloving and lover hate

Forget the moment ere the moment slips
Kiss with blind lips that seek beyond the lips

Who want , and know not what we want , and cry
With crooked mouths for Heaven , and throw it by

Love 's for completeness ! No perfection grows
'Twixt leg , and arm , elbow , and ear , and nose

And joint , and socket ; but unsatisfied
Sprawling desires , shapeless , perverse , denied

Finger with finger wreathes ; we love , and gape
Fantastic shape to mazed fantastic shape

Straggling , irregular , perplexed , embossed
Grotesquely twined , extravagantly lost

By crescive paths and strange protuberant ways
From sanity and from wholeness and from grace

How can love triumph , how can solace be
Where fever turns toward fever , knee toward knee

Could we but fill to harmony , and dwell
Simple as our thought and as perfectible

Rise disentangled from humanity
Strange whole and new into simplicity

Grow to a radiant round love , and bear
Unfluctuant passion for some perfect sphere

Love moon to moon unquestioning , and be
Like the star Lunisequa , steadfastly

Following the round clear orb of her delight
Patiently ever , through the eternal night

And country eyes , and quiet faces
All these were round my steady paces

Saw hands that beckoned , shone , were gone
In the green and gold . And I went on

From tree to tree , and distantly
Followed me , followed me

I turned , slipped in and out of sight
I trod as quiet as the night

And bowed , slid in , and sighed and curled
Hidden at rest from all the world

Meward a sound of shaken boughs
And ceased , above my intricate house

Calm clouds of scent , that I did weep
And stroked my face . I fell asleep

Laughed in the sun , and kissed the lovely grass
You said , `` Through glory and ecstasy we pass

Life is our cry . We have kept the faith ! '' we said
`` We shall go down with unreluctant tread

And laughed , that had such brave true things to say
-- And then you suddenly cried , and turned away

In love , in faith unbroken dwell
Friends radiant and inseparable

THAT IN HIS LONE OBSCURE DISTRESS
EACH WALKETH IN A WILDERNESS

I heard the thin gnat-voices cry
Star to faint star , across the sky

He lies
And waits ; and once in timeless sick surmise

Through the dead air heaves up an unknown hand
Like a dry branch . No life is in that land

They did not know his hymns
Were silence ; and her limbs

That had served Love so well
Dust , and a filthy smell

Each his own tiny face
And in that long embrace

Feel lip and breast grow warm
To breast and lip and arm

And knew , so closely pressed
Chill air on lip and breast

And , with a sick surprise
The emptiness of eyes

For the woods and hills that I never knew
The more excellent way 's yet mine ! And you

We talk as of old ; as of old you go
Out under the sky , and laughing , I know

Smiles you welcome there ; the woods that love you
Close lovely and conquering arms above you

And still in the white neat bed I strive
Most impotently against that gyve

Being less now than a thought , even
To you alone with your hills and heaven

To Priam 's palace , sword in hand , to sate
On that adulterous whore a ten years ' hate

Till the still innermost chamber fronted him
He swung his sword , and crashed into the dim

And that her neck curved down in such a way
And he felt tired . He flung the sword away

That journey home , the long connubial years
He does not tell you how white Helen bears

Child on legitimate child , becomes a scold
Haggard with virtue . Menelaus bold

Waxed garrulous , and sacked a hundred Troys
'Twixt noon and supper . And her golden voice

So Menelaus nagged ; and Helen cried
And Paris slept on by Scamander side

When I see you , who were so wise and cool
Gazing with silly sickness on that fool

You 've given your love to , your adoring hands
Touch his so intimately that each understands

I know , most hidden things ; and when I know
Your holiest dreams yield to the stupid bow

Of his red lips , and that the empty grace
Of those strong legs and arms , that rosy face

Has beaten your heart to such a flame of love
That you have given him every touch and move

Wrinkle and secret of you , all your life
-- Oh ! then I know I 'm waiting , lover-wife

For the great time when love is at a close
And all its fruit 's to watch the thickening nose

And sweaty neck and dulling face and eye
That are yours , and you , most surely , till you die

Day after day you 'll sit with him and note
The greasier tie , the dingy wrinkling coat

As prettiness turns to pomp , and strength to fat
And love , love , love to habit ! And after that

When all that 's fine in man is at an end
And you , that loved young life and clean , must tend

A foul sick fumbling dribbling body and old
When his rare lips hang flabby and ca n't hold

Slobber , and you 're enduring that worst thing
Senility 's queasy furtive love-making

And searching those dear eyes for human meaning
Propping the bald and helpless head , and cleaning

A scrap that life 's flung by , and love 's forgotten
Then you 'll be tired ; and passion dead and rotten

And he 'll be dirty , dirty ! O lithe and free
And lightfoot , that the poor heart cries to see

That 's how I 'll see your man and you ! -- But you
-- Oh , when THAT time comes , you 'll be dirty too

When you were there , and you , and you
Happiness crowned the night ; I too

Laughing and looking , one of all
I watched the quivering lamplight fall

On plate and flowers and pouring tea
And cup and cloth ; and they and we

Flung all the dancing moments by
With jest and glitter . Lip and eye

Flashed on the glory , shone and cried
Improvident , unmemoried

And fitfully and like a flame
The light of laughter went and came

Proud in their careless transience moved
The changing faces that I loved

Till suddenly , and otherwhence
I looked upon your innocence

For lifted clear and still and strange
From the dark woven flow of change

Under a vast and starless sky
I saw the immortal moment lie

One instant I , an instant , knew
As God knows all . And it and you

I , above Time , oh , blind ! could see
In witless immortality

Hung on the air , an amber stream
I saw the fire 's unglittering gleam

The painted flame , the frozen smoke
No more the flooding lamplight broke

On flying eyes and lips and hair
But lay , but slept unbroken there

On stiller flesh , and body breathless
And lips and laughter stayed and deathless

And words on which no silence grew
Light was more alive than you

For suddenly , and otherwhence
I looked on your magnificence

I saw the stillness and the light
And you , august , immortal , white

Holy and strange ; and every glint
Posture and jest and thought and tint

Freed from the mask of transiency
Triumphant in eternity

Dazed at length
Human eyes grew , mortal strength

Wearied ; and Time began to creep
Change closed about me like a sleep

Light glinted on the eyes I loved
The cup was filled . The bodies moved

The drifting petal came to ground
The laughter chimed its perfect round

The broken syllable was ended
And I , so certain and so friended

How could I cloud , or how distress
The heaven of your unconsciousness

Or shake at Time 's sufficient spell
Stammering of lights unutterable

The eternal holiness of you
The timeless end , you never knew

The peace that lay , the light that shone
You never knew that I had gone

A million miles away , and stayed
A million years . The laughter played

Unbroken round me ; and the jest
Flashed on . And we that knew the best

Down wonderful hours grew happier yet
I sang at heart , and talked , and eat

And lived from laugh to laugh , I too
When you were there , and you , and you

Amazed with sorrow . Down the morning one
Far golden horn in the gold of trees and sun

Forgot to dance . Dumb lay the unfalling stream
Life one eternal instant rose in dream

And still the sick ship rolls . 'T is hard , I tell ye
To choose 'twixt love and nausea , heart and belly

Long roads across a gleaming empty sky
Outcast and doomed and driven , you and I

Alone , serene beyond all love or hate
Terror or triumph , were content to wait

We , silent and all-knowing . Suddenly
Swept through the heaven low-crouching from on high

Great Hopes gold-armoured , jester Fantasies
And pilgrim Dreams , and little beggar Sighs

AH ! not now , when desire burns , and the wind calls , and the suns of spring
Light-foot dance in the woods , whisper of life , woo me to wayfaring

Ah ! not now should you come , now when the road beckons , and good friends call
Where are songs to be sung , fights to be fought , yea ! and the best of all

Love , on myriad lips fairer than yours , kisses you could not give
Dearest , why should I mourn , whimper , and whine , I that have yet to live

Sorrow will I forget , tears for the best , love on the lips of you
Now , when dawn in the blood wakes , and the sun laughs up the eastern blue

IÃ•ll forget and be glad ! Only at length , dear , when the great day ends
When love dies with the last light , and the last song has been sung , and friends

All are perished , and gloom strides on the heaven : then , as alone I lie
Ã•Mid DeathÃ•s gathering winds , frightened and dumb , sick for the past , may I

Feel you suddenly there , cool at my brow ; then may I hear the peace
Of your voice at the last , whispering love , calling , ere all can cease

In the silence of death ; then may I see dimly , and know , a space
Bending over me , last light in the dark , once , as of old , your face

HERE the flame that was ash , shrine that was void , lost in the haunted wood
I have tended and loved , year upon year , I in the solitude

Waiting , quiet and glad-eyed in the dark , knowing that once a gleam
Glowed and went through the wood . Still I abode strong in a golden dream

Unrecaptured . For I , I that had faith , knew that a face would glance
One day , white in the dim woods , and a voice call , and a radiance

Fill the grove , and the fire suddenly leapÃ‰ and , in the heart of it
End of labouring , you ! Therefore I kept ready the altar , lit

The flame , burning apart . Face of my dreams vainly in vision white
Gleaming down to me , lo ! hopeless I rise now . For about midnight

Whispers grew through the wood suddenly , strange cries in the boughs above
Grated , cries like a laugh . Silent and black then through the sacred grove

Great birds flew , as a dream , troubling the leaves , passing at length . I knew
Long expected and long loved , that afar , God of the dim wood , you

Somewhere lay , as a child sleeping , a child suddenly reft from mirth
White and wonderful yet , white in your youth , stretched upon foreign earth

God , immortal and dead ! Therefore I go ; never to rest , or win
Peace , and worship of you more , and the dumb wood and the shrine therein

So light we were , so right we were , so fair faith shone
And the way was laid so certainly , that , when I 'd gone

What dumb thing looked up at you ? Was it something heard
Or a sudden cry , that meekly and without a word

You broke the faith , and strangely , weakly , slipped apart
You gave in -- you , the proud of heart , unbowed of heart

Was this , friend , the end of all that we could do
And have you found the best for you , the rest for you

Did you learn so suddenly ( and I not by
Some whispered story , that stole the glory from the sky

And ended all the splendid dream , and made you go
So dully from the fight we know , the light we know

O faithless ! the faith remains , and I must pass
Gay down the way , and on alone . Under the grass

You wait ; the breeze moves in the trees , and stirs , and calls
And covers you with white petals , with light petals

There it shall crumble , frail and fair , under the sun
O little heart , your brittle heart ; till day be done

And the shadows gather , falling light , and , white with dew
Whisper , and weep ; and creep to you . Good sleep to you

Safe though all safety 's lost ; safe where men fall
And if these poor limbs die , safest of all

There 's none of these so lonely and poor of old
But , dying , has made us rarer gifts than gold

Of work and joy , and that unhoped serene
That men call age ; and those who would have been

There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter
And lit by the rich skies , all day . And after

And that no-place which gave them birth , shall close
The rainbow and the rose

Musing upon them ; as a mother , who
Has watched her children all the rich day through

Sits , quiet-handed , in the fading light
When children sleep , ere night

Then , oh ! then , the wise agree
Comes our immortality

Mamua , there waits a land
Hard for us to understand

There is the Face , whose ghosts we are
The real , the never-setting Star

Instead of lovers , Love shall be
For hearts , Immutability

And my laughter , and my pain
Shall home to the Eternal Brain

CoralÃ•s hues and rainbows there
And TeÅ¸raÃ•s braided hair

And dawns of pearl and gold and red
Mamua , your lovelier head

Divinely down the scented shade
Where feet to Ambulation fade

How shall we wind these wreaths of ours
Where there are neither heads nor flowers

And in the waterÃ•s soft caress
Wash the mind of foolishness

Well this side of Paradise
ThereÃ•s little comfort in the wise

In your arms was still delight
Quiet as a street at night

And thoughts of you , I do remember
Were green leaves in a darkened chamber

Were dark clouds in a moonless sky
Love , in you , went passing by

Penetrative , remote , and rare
Like a bird in the wide air

And , as the bird , it left no trace
In the heaven of your face

In your stupidity I found
The sweet hush after a sweet sound

All about you was the light
That dims the greying end of night

Desire was the unrisen sun
Joy the day not yet begun

With tree whispering to tree
Without wind , quietly

Wisdom slept within your hair
And Long-Suffering was there

And , in the flowing of your dress
Undiscerning Tenderness

And when you thought , it seemed to me
Infinitely , and like a sea

About the slight world you had known
Your vast unconsciousness was thrown

O haven without wave or tide
Silence , in which all songs have died

Holy book , where hearts are still
And home at length under the hill

O mother quiet , breasts of peace
Where love itself would faint and cease

O infinite deep I never knew
I would come back , come back to you

Find you , as a pool unstirred
Kneel down by you , and never a word

Lay my head , and nothing said
In your hands , ungarlanded

And a long watch you would keep
And I should sleep , and I should sleep

I have been so great a lover : filled my days
So proudly with the splendour of Love 's praise

The pain , the calm , and the astonishment
Desire illimitable , and still content

And all dear names men use , to cheat despair
For the perplexed and viewless streams that bear

Our hearts at random down the dark of life
Now , ere the unthinking silence on that strife

Steals down , I would cheat drowsy Death so far
My night shall be remembered for a star

That outshone all the suns of all men 's days
Shall I not crown them with immortal praise

Whom I have loved , who have given me , dared with me
High secrets , and in darkness knelt to see

The inenarrable godhead of delight
Love is a flame ; -- we have beaconed the world 's night

A city : -- and we have built it , these and I
An emperor : -- we have taught the world to die

So , for their sakes I loved , ere I go hence
And the high cause of Love 's magnificence

And to keep loyalties young , I 'll write those names
Golden for ever , eagles , crying flames

And set them as a banner , that men may know
To dare the generations , burn , and blow

Out on the wind of Time , shining and streaming
These I have loved : White plates and cups , clean-gleaming

Ringed with blue lines ; and feathery , faery dust
Wet roofs , beneath the lamp-light ; the strong crust

Of friendly bread ; and many-tasting food
Rainbows ; and the blue bitter smoke of wood

And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers
And flowers themselves , that sway through sunny hours

Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon
Then , the cool kindliness of sheets , that soon

Smooth away trouble ; and the rough male kiss
Of blankets ; grainy wood ; live hair that is

Shining and free ; blue-massing clouds ; the keen
Unpassioned beauty of a great machine

The benison of hot water ; furs to touch
The good smell of old clothes ; and other such

The comfortable smell of friendly fingers
Hair 's fragrance , and the musty reek that lingers

About dead leaves and last year 's ferns Dear names
And thousand other throng to me ! Royal flames

Sweet water 's dimpling laugh from tap or spring
Holes in the ground ; and voices that do sing

Voices in laughter , too ; and body 's pain
Soon turned to peace ; and the deep-panting train

Firm sands ; the little dulling edge of foam
That browns and dwindles as the wave goes home

And washen stones , gay for an hour ; the cold
Graveness of iron ; moist black earthen mould

Sleep ; and high places ; footprints in the dew
And oaks ; and brown horse-chestnuts , glossy-new

And new-peeled sticks ; and shining pools on grass
All these have been my loves . And these shall pass

Whatever passes not , in the great hour
Nor all my passion , all my prayers , have power

To hold them with me through the gate of Death
They 'll play deserter , turn with the traitor breath

Break the high bond we made , and sell Love 's trust
And sacramented covenant to the dust

-- -- Oh , never a doubt but , somewhere , I shall wake
And give what 's left of love again , and make

New friends , now strangers . But the best I 've known
Stays here , and changes , breaks , grows old , is blown

About the winds of the world , and fades from brains
Of living men , and dies . Nothing remains

O dear my loves , O faithless , once again
This one last gift I give : that after men

Shall know , and later lovers , far-removed
Praise you , `` All these were lovely '' ; say , `` He loved

Fish ( fly-replete , in depth of June
Dawdling away their wat'ry noon

Ponder deep wisdom , dark or clear
Each secret fishy hope or fear

Fish say , they have their Stream and Pond
But is there anything Beyond

This life can not be All , they swear
For how unpleasant , if it were

One may not doubt that , somehow , Good
Shall come of Water and of Mud

And , sure , the reverent eye must see
A Purpose in Liquidity

We darkly know , by Faith we cry
The future is not Wholly Dry

Mud unto mud ! -- Death eddies near
Not here the appointed End , not here

But somewhere , beyond Space and Time
Is wetter water , slimier slime

And there ( they trust ) there swimmeth One
Who swam ere rivers were begun

Immense , of fishy form and mind
Squamous , omnipotent , and kind

And under that Almighty Fin
The littlest fish may enter in

Oh ! never fly conceals a hook
Fish say , in the Eternal Brook

But more than mundane weeds are there
And mud , celestially fair

Fat caterpillars drift around
And Paradisal grubs are found

Unfading moths , immortal flies
And the worm that never dies

And in that Heaven of all their wish
There shall be no more land , say fish

For if the soul be not in place
What has laid trouble in her face

And , sits there nothing ware and wise
Behind the curtains of her eyes

And if the spirit be not there
Why is fragrance in the hair

`` Oh love is fair , and love is rare ; '' my dear one she said
`` But love goes lightly over . '' I bowed her foolish head

And kissed her hair and laughed at her . Such a child was she
So new to love , so true to love , and she spoke so bitterly

But there 's wisdom in women , of more than they have known
And thoughts go blowing through them , are wiser than their own

Or how should my dear one , being ignorant and young
Have cried on love so bitterly , with so true a tongue

So . . . the poor love of fools and blind I 've proved you
For , foul or lovely , 't was a fool that loved you

Softly along the dim way to your room
And found you sleeping in the quiet gloom

About my head , and held it . I had rest
Unhoped this side of Heaven , beneath your breast

So lightly I played with those dark memories
Just as a child , beneath the summer skies

Drift down the darkness . Plangent , hidden from eyes
Somewhere an ` eukaleli ' thrills and cries

And stabs with pain the night 's brown savagery
And dark scents whisper ; and dim waves creep to me

Gleam like a woman 's hair , stretch out , and rise
And new stars burn into the ancient skies

Whose perplexed heart did evil , foolishly
A long while since , and by some other sea

So a poor ghost , beside his misty streams
Is haunted by strange doubts , evasive dreams

We 'll beat on the substantial doors , nor tread
Those dusty high-roads of the aimless dead

Some low sweet alley between wind and wind
Stoop under faint gleams , thread the shadows , find

In noiseless tumult , break and wave and flow
Now tread the far South , or lift rounds of snow

Up to the white moon 's hidden loveliness
Some pause in their grave wandering comradeless

And turn with profound gesture vague and slow
As who would pray good for the world , but know

Out of the wash of days and temporal tide
Where Faith and Good , Wisdom and Truth abide

There stand the immortal ensigns of our war
Our melting flesh fixed Beauty there , a star

One after one , like tasting a sweet food
I have need to busy my heart with quietude

But darkens , and dies out from kiss to kiss
All this is love ; and all love is but this

That 's tossed down dusty pavements by the wind
Saying , `` She is most wise , patient and kind

So that I think all Heaven in flower to fold me
She 'll give me all I ask , kiss me and hold me

Three years , or a bit less
It was n't a success

By Tring and Lilley Hoo
As a free man may do

Forgotten at the last
Even Love goes past

And the brave sting of rain
I may not meet again

For none to mar or mend
That have themselves to friend

That soothes the darkening shires
And laughter , and inn-fires

And the dead leaves in the lane
Certainly , these remain

And lips as soft , but true
And I daresay she will do

Young Mary , loitering once her garden way
Felt a warm splendour grow in the April day

As wine that blushes water through . And soon
Out of the gold air of the afternoon

One knelt before her : hair he had , or fire
Bound back above his ears with golden wire

Baring the eager marble of his face
Not man 's nor woman 's was the immortal grace

Rounding the limbs beneath that robe of white
And lighting the proud eyes with changeless light

Incurious . Calm as his wings , and fair
That presence filled the garden . She stood there

Saying , `` What would you , Sir ? '' He told his word
`` Blessed art thou of women ! '' Half she heard

Hands folded and face bowed , half long had known
The message of that clear and holy tone

That fluttered hot sweet sobs about her heart
Such serene tidings moved such human smart

Her breath came quick as little flakes of snow
Her hands crept up her breast . She did but know

It was not hers . She felt a trembling stir
Within her body , a will too strong for her

That held and filled and mastered all . With eyes
Closed , and a thousand soft short broken sighs

She gave submission ; fearful , meek , and glad
She wished to speak . Under her breasts she had

Such multitudinous burnings , to and fro
And throbs not understood ; she did not know

If they were hurt or joy for her ; but only
That she was grown strange to herself , half lonely

All wonderful , filled full of pains to come
And thoughts she dare not think , swift thoughts and dumb

Human , and quaint , her own , yet very far
Divine , dear , terrible , familiar

Her heart was faint for telling ; to relate
Her limbs ' sweet treachery , her strange high estate

Over and over , whispering , half revealing
Weeping ; and so find kindness to her healing

'Twixt tears and laughter , panic hurrying her
She raised her eyes to that fair messenger

He knelt unmoved , immortal ; with his eyes
Gazing beyond her , calm to the calm skies

Radiant , untroubled in his wisdom , kind
His sheaf of lilies stirred not in the wind

How should she , pitiful with mortality
Try the wide peace of that felicity

With ripples of her perplexed shaken heart
And hints of human ecstasy , human smart

And whispers of the lonely weight she bore
And how her womb within was hers no more

And at length hers ? Being tired , she bowed her head
And said , `` So be it ! '' The great wings were spread

Showering glory on the fields , and fire
The whole air , singing , bore him up , and higher

Unswerving , unreluctant . Soon he shone
A gold speck in the gold skies ; then was gone

The day that YOUTH had died
There came to his grave-side

In decent mourning , from the country 's ends
Those scatter 'd friends

No quest of his unsharÃ•d
All these , with loitering feet and sad head barÃ•d

Folly went first
With muffled bells and coxcomb still reversÃ•d

And after trod the bearers , hat in handÃ‘
Laughter , most hoarse , and Captain Pride with tanned

And martial face all grim , and fussy Joy
Who had to catch a train , and Lust , poor , snivelling boy

These bore the dear departed
Behind them , broken-hearted

Came Grief , so noisy a widow , that all said
Ã’Had he but wed

And by her , trying to soothe her all the time
The fatherless children , Colour , Tune , and Rhyme

( The sweet lad Rhyme ) , ran all-uncomprehending
Then , at the wayÃ•s sad ending

Round the raw grave they stayÃ•d . Old Wisdom read
In mumbling tone , the Service for the Dead

Impatience , ever taking out his watch
Faith , who was deaf , and had to lean , to catch

Yes , with much woe and mourning general
At dead YouthÃ•s funeral

Who erst the fair and living Youth did know
All , except only Love . Love had died long ago

JUST now the lilac is in bloom
All before my little room

And in my flower-beds , I think
Smile the carnation and the pink

And down the borders , well I know
The poppy and the pansy blow

Oh ! there the chestnuts , summer through
Beside the river make for you

A tunnel of green gloom , and sleep
Deeply above ; and green and deep

The stream mysterious glides beneath
Green as a dream and deep as death

Ã‘Oh , damn ! I know it ! and I know
How the May fields all golden show

And when the day is young and sweet
Gild gloriously the bare feet

That run to bathe , Du lieber Gott
Here am I , sweating , sick , and hot

And there the shadowed waters fresh
Lean up to embrace the naked flesh

Temperamentvoll German Jews
Drink beer around ; Ã‘and there the dews

Are soft beneath a morn of gold
Here tulips bloom as they are told

Unkempt about those hedges blows
An English unofficial rose

And there the unregulated sun
Slopes down to rest when day is done

And wakes a vague unpunctual star
A slippered Hesper ; and there are

Meads towards Haslingfield and Coton
Where das BetretenÃ•s not verboten

... would I were
In Grantchester , in Grantchester ! Ã‘

Some , it may be , can get in touch
With Nature there , or Earth , or such

And clever modern men have seen
A Faun a-peeping through the green

And felt the Classics were not dead
To glimpse a NaiadÃ•s reedy head

Or hear the Goat-foot piping low
But these are things I do not know

I only know that you may lie
Day long and watch the Cambridge sky

And , flower-lulled in sleepy grass
Hear the cool lapse of hours pass

Until the centuries blend and blur
In Grantchester , in Grantchester

Still in the dawnlit waters cool
His ghostly Lordship swims his pool

And tries the strokes , essays the tricks
Long learnt on Hellespont , or Styx

Dan Chaucer hears his river still
Chatter beneath a phantom mill

Tennyson notes , with studious eye
How Cambridge waters hurry by

And in that garden , black and white
Creep whispers through the grass all night

And spectral dance , before the dawn
A hundred Vicars down the lawn

Curates , long dust , will come and go
On lissom , clerical , printless toe

And oft between the boughs is seen
The sly shade of a Rural Dean

Till , at a shiver in the skies
Vanishing with Satanic cries

The prim ecclesiastic rout
Leaves but a startled sleeper-out

Grey heavens , the first birdÃ•s drowsy calls
The falling house that never falls

God ! I will pack , and take a train
And get me to England once again

For EnglandÃ•s the one land , I know
Where men with Splendid Hearts may go

And Cambridgeshire , of all England
The shire for Men who Understand

And of that district I prefer
The lovely hamlet Grantchester

For Cambridge people rarely smile
Being urban , squat , and packed with guile

And Royston men in the far South
Are black and fierce and strange of mouth

At Over they fling oaths at one
And worse than oaths at Trumpington

And Ditton girls are mean and dirty
And thereÃ•s none in Harston under thirty

And folks in Shelford and those parts
Have twisted lips and twisted hearts

And Barton men make Cockney rhymes
And CotonÃ•s full of nameless crimes

And things are done youÃ•d not believe
At Madingley on Christmas Eve

Strong men have run for miles and miles
When one from Cherry Hinton smiles

Strong men have blanched , and shot their wives
Rather than send them to St. Ives

Strong men have cried like babes , bydam
To hear what happened at Babraham

But Grantchester ! ah , Grantchester
ThereÃ•s peace and holy quiet there

Great clouds along pacific skies
And men and women with straight eyes

Lithe children lovelier than a dream
A bosky wood , a slumbrous stream

And little kindly winds that creep
Round twilight corners , half asleep

In Grantchester their skins are white
They bathe by day , they bathe by night

The women there do all they ought
The men observe the Rules of Thought

They love the Good ; they worship Truth
They laugh uproariously in youth

( And when they get to feeling old
They up and shoot themselves , IÃ•m told

Ah God ! to see the branches stir
Across the moon at Grantchester

To smell the thrilling-sweet and rotten
Unforgettable , unforgotten

River-smell , and hear the breeze
Sobbing in the little trees

Say , do the elm-clumps greatly stand
Still guardians of that holy land

The chestnuts shade , in reverend dream
The yet unacademic stream

Is dawn a secret shy and cold
Anadyomene , silver-gold

And sunset still a golden sea
From Haslingfield to Madingley

And after , ere the night is born
Do hares come out about the corn

Oh , is the water sweet and cool
Gentle and brown , above the pool

And laughs the immortal river still
Under the mill , under the mill

Say , is there Beauty yet to find
And Certainty ? and Quiet kind

Deep meadows yet , for to forget
The lies , and truths , and pain ? Ã‰ oh ! yet

Stands the Church clock at ten to three
And is there honey still for tea

A nest of tuneful persons , to my eye
Like four and twenty blackbirds in a pye

Explaining metaphysics to the nation
I wish he would explain his explanation

Gasping on deck , because you soar too high
Bob , And fall for lack of moisture quite a dry

And he who understands it would be able
To add a story to the tower of Babel

There is a narrowness in such a notion
Which makes me wish you 'd change your lakes for ocean

You 're shabby fellows -- true -- but poets still
And duly seated on the immortal hill

Scott , Rogers , Campbell , Moore , and Crabbe will try
'Gainst you the question with posterity

Of merit , and complaint of present days
Is not the certain path to future praise

The major part of such appellants go
To -- God knows where -- for no one else can know

He did not loathe the sire to laud the son
But closed the tyrant-hater he begun

Would he adore a sultan ? He obey
The intellectual eunuch Castlereagh

To lengthen fetters by another fixed
And offer poison long already mixed

That turns and turns to give the world a notion
Of endless torments and perpetual motion

A tinkering slave-maker , who mends old chains
With God and man 's abhorrence for its gains

Fearless , because no feeling dwells in ice
Its very courage stagnates to a vice

Europe has slaves , allies , kings , armies still
And Southey lives to sing them very ill

To keep one creed 's a task grown quite
Herculean Is it not so , my Tory , ultra-Julian

We all have seen him , in the pantomime
Sent to the devil somewhat ere his time

France , too , had Buonaparte and Dumourier
Recorded in the Moniteur and Courier

Exceedingly remarkable at times
But not at all adapted to my rhymes

Besides , the prince is all for the land-service
Forgetting Duncan , Nelson , Howe , and Jervis

Fit for my poem ( that is , for my new one
So , as I said , I 'll take my friend Don Juan

Palace , or garden , paradise , or cavern
Which serves the happy couple for a tavern

Narrating somewhat of Don Juan 's father
And also of his mother , if you 'd rather

Don Juan 's parents lived beside the river
A noble stream , and call 'd the Guadalquivir

Than Jose , who begot our hero , who
Begot -- but that 's to come -- Well , to renew

Finding themselves so very much exceeded
In their own way by all the things that she did

Could never make a memory so fine as
That which adorn 'd the brain of Donna Inez

Her evening silk , or , in the summer , muslin
And other stuffs , with which I wo n't stay puzzling

Her thoughts were theorems , her words a problem
As if she deem 'd that mystery would ennoble 'em

One sad example more , that 'All is vanity
( The jury brought their verdict in 'Insanity

To others ' share let 'female errors fall
For she had not even one -- the worst of all

In virtues nothing earthly could surpass her
Save thine 'incomparable oil , ' Macassar

Don Jose , like a lineal son of Eve
Went plucking various fruit without her leave

Whisper 'd he had a mistress , some said two
But for domestic quarrels one will do

And let few opportunities escape
Of getting her liege lord into a scrape

And fans turn into falchions in fair hands
And why and wherefore no one understands

But -- Oh ! ye lords of ladies intellectual
Inform us truly , have they not hen-peck 'd you all

'T is in arranging all my friends ' affairs
Not having of my own domestic cares

For little Juan o'er me threw , down stairs
A pail of housemaid 's water unawares

To school , or had him soundly whipp 'd at home
To teach him manners for the time to come

Until at length the smother 'd fire broke out
And put the business past all kind of doubt

Save that her duty both to man and God
Required this conduct -- which seem 'd very odd

Then advocates , inquisitors , and judges
Some for amusement , others for old grudges

And saw his agonies with such sublimity
That all the world exclaim 'd , 'What magnanimity

Revenge in person 's certainly no virtue
But then 't is not my fault , if others hurt you

And science profits by this resurrection
Dead scandals form good subjects for dissection

But scarce a fee was paid on either side
Before , unluckily , Don Jose died

To public feeling , which on this occasion
Was manifested in a great sensation

He died of the slow fever call 'd the tertian
And left his widow to her own aversion

As Numa 's ( who was also named Pompilius
He had been ill brought up , and was born bilious

No choice was left his feelings or his pride
Save death or Doctors ' Commons -- so he died

An only son left with an only mother
Is brought up much more wisely than another

He learn 'd the arts of riding , fencing , gunnery
And how to scale a fortress -- or a nunnery

Arts , sciences , no branch was made a mystery
To Juan 's eyes , excepting natural history

Or hints continuation of the species
Was ever suffer 'd , lest he should grow vicious

Were forced to make an odd sort ! of apology
For Donna Inez dreaded the Mythology

But Virgil 's songs are pure , except that horrid one
Beginning with 'Formosum Pastor Corydon

And then what proper person can be partial
To all those nauseous epigrams of Martial

They only add them all in an appendix
Which saves , in fact , the trouble of an index

Instead of standing staring all together
Like garden gods -- and not so decent either

Is more than I know -- But Don Juan 's mother
Kept this herself , and gave her son another

As Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions
Which make the reader envy his transgressions

She did this during even her husband 's life
I recommend as much to every wife

For half his days were pass 'd at church , the other
Between his tutors , confessor , and mother

Was to declare how sage , and still , and steady
Her young philosopher was grown already

But scandal 's my aversion -- I protest
Against all evil speaking , even in jest

No -- no -- I 'd send him out betimes to college
For there it was I pick 'd up my own knowledge

I never married -- but , I think , I know
That sons should not be educated so

If any said so , for to be precocious
Was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious

Her zone to Venus , or his bow to Cupid
( But this last simile is trite and stupid

Some went to Africa , some stay 'd in Spain
Her great-great-grandmamma chose to remain

Marrying their cousins -- nay , their aunts , and nieces
Which always spoils the breed , if it increases

'T is said that Donna Julia 's grandmamma
Produced her Don more heirs at love than law

I shall have much to speak about ) , and she
Was married , charming , chaste , and twenty-three

But would have been , perhaps , but for the soul
Which struggled through and chasten 'd down the whole

Possess 'd an air and grace by no means common
Her stature tall -- I hate a dumpy woman

Ladies even of the most uneasy virtue
Prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty

What men call gallantry , and gods adultery
Is much more common where the climate 's sultry

The lover , who must pay a handsome price
Because it is a marketable vice

Yet he was jealous , though he did not show it
For jealousy dislikes the world to know it

That Inez had , ere Don Alfonso 's marriage
Forgot with him her very prudent carriage

And if she could not ( who can ? ) silence scandal
At least she left it a more slender handle

I 'm really puzzled what to think or say
She kept her counsel in so close a way

These few short years make wondrous alterations
Particularly amongst sun-burnt nations

But as for Juan , he had no more notion
Than he who never saw the sea of ocean

Wrought change with all Armida 's fairy art
Like what this light touch left on Juan 's heart

And will not dare to trust itself with truth
And love is taught hypocrisy from youth

Coldness or anger , even disdain or hate
Are masks it often wears , and still too late

And merely tend to show how greatly love is
Embarrass 'd at first starting with a novice

She pray 'd the Virgin Mary for her grace
As being the best judge of a lady 's case

'T is surely Juan now -- No ! I 'm afraid
That night the Virgin was no further prayed

For people who are pleasanter than others
But then they only seem so many brothers

And if the man should ask , 't is but denial
I recommend young ladies to make trial

And so I 'd have her think , were I the man
On whom her reveries celestial ran

If people go beyond , 't is quite a crime
But not my fault -- I tell them all in time

He might be taught , by love and her together
I really do n't know what , nor Julia either

But whether Julia to the task was equal
Is that which must be mention 'd in the sequel

Christians have burnt each other , quite persuaded
That all the Apostles would have done as they did

( This should be entre nous , for Julia thought
In French , but then the rhyme would go for naught

For he would learn the rudiments of love
I mean the seraph way of those above

Thing quite in course , and not at all alarming
Which , with a little patience , might grow charming

By solitude I mean a sultan 's , not
A hermit 's , with a haram for a grot

For that same twining 'transport and security
Are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity

Or 'transport , ' as we knew all that before
But beg 'Security ' will bolt the door

So that their plan and prosody are eligible
Unless , like Wordsworth , they prove unintelligible

And turn 'd , without perceiving his condition
Like Coleridge , into a metaphysician

To perfect knowledge of the boundless skies
And then he thought of Donna Julia 's eyes

If you think 't was philosophy that this did
I ca n't help thinking puberty assisted

He found how much old Time had been a winner
He also found that he had lost his dinner

Their spells , and give them to the passing gale
According to some good old woman 's tale

With -- several other things , which I forget
Or which , at least , I need not mention yet

Whether it was she did not see , or would not
Or , like all very clever people , could not

I say , when these same gentlemen are jealous
They make some blunder , which their ladies tell us

And when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly
He wonders at their vice , and not his folly

And then the mother cries , the father swears
And wonders why the devil he got heirs

Perhaps to open Don Alfonso 's eyes
In case he thought his wife too great a prize

That there are months which nature grows more merry in
March has its hares , and May must have its heroine

Leaving at last not much besides chronology
Excepting the post-obits of theology

With all the trophies of triumphant song
He won them well , and may he wear them long

When two such faces are so , 't would be wise
But very difficult , to shut their eyes

The precipice she stood on was immense
So was her creed in her own innocence

And through all climes , the snowy and the sunny
Sounds ill in love , whate'er it may in money

But then , no doubt , it equally as true is
A good deal may be bought for fifty Louis

One hand on Juan 's carelessly was thrown
Quite by mistake -- she thought it was her own

She who for many years had watch 'd her son so
I 'm very certain mine would not have done so

Had she imagined such a thing could rouse
A feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse

She blush 'd , and frown 'd not , but she strove to speak
And held her tongue , her voice was grown so weak

On which three single hours of moonshine smile
And then she looks so modest all the while

Breathes also to the heart , and o'er it throws
A loving languor , which is not repose

And then -- God knows what next -- I ca n't go on
I 'm almost sorry that I e'er begun

A charlatan , a coxcomb -- and have been
At best , no better than a go-between

A little still she strove , and much repented
And whispering ' I will ne'er consent ' -- consented

I care not for new pleasures , as the old
Are quite enough for me , so they but hold

I 'm very sorry , very much ashamed
And mean , next winter , to be quite reclaimed

Of Aristotle and the Rules , 't is fit
To beg his pardon when I err a bit

'T was in November , but I 'm not so sure
About the day -- the era 's more obscure

From leaf to leaf ; 't is sweet to view on high
The rainbow , based on ocean , span the sky

Of bees , the voice of girls , the song of birds
The lisp of children , and their earliest words

Sweet is revenge -- especially to women
Pillage to soldiers , prize-money to seamen

That all the Israelites are fit to mob its
Next owner for their double-damn 'd post-obits

Against the world ; and dear the schoolboy spot
We ne'er forget , though there we are forgot

No doubt in fable , as the unforgiven
Fire which Prometheus filch 'd for us from heaven

You 'd best begin with truth , and when you 've lost your
Labour , there 's a sure market for imposture

With which the Doctor paid off an old pox
By borrowing a new one from an ox

I said the small-pox has gone out of late
Perhaps it may be follow 'd by the great

And which in ravage the more loathsome evil is
Their real lues , or our pseudo-syphilis

Are ways to benefit mankind , as true
Perhaps , as shooting them at Waterloo

The path is through perplexing ways , and when
The goal is gain 'd , we die , you know -- and then

And the loud breaker boils against the rock
And sober suns must set at five o'clock

I 'm fond of fire , and crickets , and all that
A lobster salad , and champagne , and chat

The door was fasten 'd , but with voice and fist
First knocks were heard , then 'Madam -- Madam -- hist

Will all be here ; perhaps he yet may fly
Surely the window 's not so very high

Examples of this kind are so contagious
Were one not punish 'd , all would be outrageous

And summon lackeys , arm 'd with fire and sword
To prove himself the thing he most abhorred

I ca n't tell why she should take all this trouble
To prove her mistress had been sleeping double

And truant husband should return , and say
'My dear , I was the first who came away

Dare you suspect me , whom the thought would kill
Search , then , the room ! ' -- Alfonso said , ' I will

Arras they prick 'd and curtains with their swords
And wounded several shutters , and some boards

And seems to me almost a sort of blunder
Of looking in the bed as well as under

But now I 'll bear no more , nor here remain
If there be law or lawyers in all Spain

Ungrateful , perjured , barbarous Don Alfonso
How dare you think your lady would go on so

So much , he always doubted I was married
How sorry you will be when I 've miscarried

Is it for this that General Count O'Reilly
Who took Algiers , declares I used him vilely

And Lord Mount Coffeehouse , the Irish peer
Who kill 'd himself for love ( with wine ) last year

O , valiant man ! with sword drawn and cock 'd trigger
Now , tell me , do n't you cut a pretty figure

Because , no doubt , 't was for his dirty fee
And not from any love to you nor me

But , as my maid 's undrest , pray turn your spies out
'Oh ! ' sobb 'd Antonia , ' I could tear their eyes out

The secret cavern of this lurking treasure
And when 't is found , let me , too , have that pleasure

Tell me -- and be assured , that since you stain
My honour thus , it shall not be in vain

My mother dream 'd not in my natal hour
That I should fall into a monster 's power

A moment at the door , that we may be
Drest to receive so much good company

God grant you feel not then the bitterest grief
Antonia ! where 's my pocket-handkerchief

Its snow through all ; -- her soft lips lie apart
And louder than her breathing beats her heart

So there were quarrels , cared not for the cause
Knowing they must be settled by the laws

And ne'er believed in negatives , till these
Were proved by competent false witnesses

Had pour 'd upon him for the last half-hour
Quick , thick , and heavy -- as a thunder-shower

He saw too , in perspective , her relations
And then he tried to muster all his patience

He cast a rueful look or two , and did
He knew not wherefore , that which he was bid

An awkward look ; as he revolved the case
The door was fasten 'd in his legal face

With much heartfelt reluctance be it said
Young Juan slipp 'd half-smother 'd , from the bed

'T were better , sure , to die so , than be shut
With maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt

At sixty years , and draw the accompts of evil
And find a deuced balance with the devil

Perhaps 't was in a different way applied
For David lived , but Juan nearly died

Antonia puzzled ; Julia did not speak
But press 'd her bloodless lip to Juan 's cheek

She whisper 'd , in great wrath -- ' I must deposit
This pretty gentleman within the closet

You 'll lose your life , and I shall lose my place
My mistress all , for that half-girlish face

And if we can but till the morning keep
Our counsel -- ( Juan , mind , you must not sleep

Regarding both with slow and sidelong view
She snuff 'd the candle , curtsied , and withdrew

His speech was a fine sample , on the whole
Of rhetoric , which the learn 'd call 'rigmarole

'T is to retort with firmness , and when he
Suspects with one , do you reproach with three

From delicacy to Don Juan 's ear
To whom she knew his mother 's fame was dear

To speak of Inez now were , one may say
Like throwing Juan in Alfonso 's way

The charming creatures lie with such a grace
There 's nothing so becoming to the face

A tear or two , and then we make it up
And then -- and then -- and then -- sit down and sup

Beseeching she no further would refuse
When , lo ! he stumbled o'er a pair of shoes

Alfonso first examined well their fashion
And then flew out into another passion

Haste -- haste ! I hear Alfonso 's hurrying feet
Day has not broke -- there 's no one in the street

But met Alfonso in his dressing-gown
Who threaten 'd death -- so Juan knock 'd him down

His blood was up : though young , he was a Tartar
And not at all disposed to prove a martyr

Much longer. -- Think of husbands ' , lovers ' lives
And how ye may be doubly widows -- wives

He fled , like Joseph , leaving it ; but there
I doubt , all likeness ends between the pair

Juan the gate gain 'd , turn 'd the key about
And liking not the inside , lock 'd the out

And how Alfonso sued for a divorce
Were in the English newspapers , of course

The best is that in short-hand ta'en by Gurney
Who to Madrid on purpose made a journey

And then , by the advice of some old ladies
She sent her son to be shipp 'd off from Cadiz

Grieved , but , perhaps , her feelings may be better
Shown in the following copy of her Letter

Be on this sheet , 't is not what it appears
My eyeballs burn and throb , but have no tears

I trace this scrawl because I can not rest
I 've nothing to reproach , or to request

Men have all these resources , we but one
To love again , and be again undone

And so farewell -- forgive me , love me -- No
That word is idle now -- but let it go

So shakes the needle , and so stands the pole
As vibrates my fond heart to my fix 'd soul

And I must even survive this last adieu
And bear with life , to love and pray for you

The motto cut upon a white cornelian
The wax was superfine , its hue vermilion

And if their approbation we experience
Perhaps they 'll have some more about a year hence

After the style of Virgil and of Homer
So that my name of Epic 's no misnomer

I 've got new mythological machinery
And very handsome supernatural scenery

Their labyrinth of fables to thread through
Whereas this story 's actually true

Is that myself , and several now in Seville
Saw Juan 's last elopement with the devil

I 'll call the work 'Longinus o'er a Bottle
Or , Every Poet his own Aristotle

Thou shalt not steal from Samuel Rogers , nor
Commit -- flirtation with the muse of Moore

Besides , in Canto Twelfth , I mean to show
The very place where wicked people go

Should captains the remark , or critics , make
They also lie too -- under a mistake

For fear some prudish readers should grow skittish
I 've bribed my grandmother 's review -- the British

And smear his page with gall instead of honey
All I can say is -- that he had the money

And that the Edinburgh Review and Quarterly
Treat a dissenting author very martyrly

And would not brook at all this sort of thing
In my hot youth -- when George the Third was King

Have spent my life , both interest and principal
And deem not , what I deem 'd , my soul invincible

Alas ! 't was not in them , but in thy power
To double even the sweetness of a flower

And in thy stead I 've got a deal of judgment
Though heaven knows how it ever found a lodgment

So for a good old-gentlemanly vice
I think I must take up with avarice

Is glittering youth , which I have spent betimes
My heart in passion , and my head on rhymes

To have , when the original is dust
A name , a wretched picture , and worse bust

Let not a monument give you or me hopes
Since not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops

So thank your stars that matters are no worse
And read your Bible , sir , and mind your purse

Your patience further than by this short sample
'T were well if others follow 'd my example

The four first rhymes are Southey 's every line
For God 's sake , reader ! take them not for mine

Since , in a way that 's rather of the oddest , he
Became divested of his native modesty

A lad of sixteen causing a divorce
Puzzled his tutors very much , of course

A husband rather old , not much in unity
With his young wife -- a time , and opportunity

A little breath , love , wine , ambition , fame
Fighting , devotion , dust , -- perhaps a name

I ca n't describe it , though so much it strike
Nor liken it -- I never saw the like

Thank Heaven I 've got no metaphor quite ready
( And so , my sober Muse -- come , let 's be steady

A dress through which the eyes give such a volley
Excepting the Venetian Fazzioli

To wean him from the wickedness of earth
And send him like a dove of promise forth

A letter , too , she gave ( he never read it
Of good advice -- and two or three of credit

The great success of Juan 's education
Spurr 'd her to teach another generation

And there he stood to take , and take again
His first -- perhaps his last -- farewell of Spain

When gazing on them , mystified by distance
We enter on our nautical existence

You sneer , and I assure you this is true
For I have found it answer -- so may you

At leaving even the most unpleasant people
And places , one keeps looking at the steeple

No doubt we weep for those the heart endears
That is , till deeper griefs congeal our tears

Behind their carriages their new portmanteau
Perhaps it may be lined with this my canto

Reflected on his present situation
And seriously resolved on reformation

Farewell , too , dearest Julia ! -- ( Here he drew
Her letter out again , and read it through

A mind diseased no remedy can physic
( Here the ship gave a lurch , and he grew sea-sick

Beloved Julia , hear me still beseeching
( Here he grew inarticulate with retching

No doubt he would have been much more pathetic
But the sea acted as a strong emetic . I

Nor that a sneeze should interrupt his sigh
Nor inflammations redden his blind eye

Could Juan 's passion , while the billows roar
Resist his stomach , ne'er at sea before

Of his departure had been sent him by
His Spanish friends for those in Italy

And the waves oozing through the port-hole made
His berth a little damp , and him afraid

For the sky show 'd it would come on to blow
And carry away , perhaps , a mast or so

The rudder tore away : 't was time to sound
The pumps , and there were four feet water found

The water rush 'd through in a way quite puzzling
While they thrust sheets , shirts , jackets , bales of muslin

By them per hour , and they had all been undone
But for the maker , Mr. Mann , of London

A gust -- which all descriptive power transcends
Laid with one blast the ship on her beam ends

Thus drownings are much talk 'd of by the divers
And swimmers , who may chance to be survivors

To part with all till every hope was blighted
And then with violence the old ship righted

As upon such occasions tars will ask
For grog , and sometimes drink rum from the cask

Strange sounds of wailing , blasphemy , devotion
Clamour 'd in chorus to the roaring ocean

Kept still aloof the crew , who , ere they sunk
Thought it would be becoming to die drunk

And even Pedrillo , his most reverend tutor
Was for some rum a disappointed suitor

In cloisters of the classic Salamanca
To follow Juan 's wake , like Sancho Panca

A glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale
The stronger pump 'd , the weaker thrumm 'd a sail

And though 't is true that man can only die once
'T is not so pleasant in the Gulf of Lyons

The ship would swim an hour , which , by good luck
Still swam -- though not exactly like a duck

Was used -- nor sail nor shore appear 'd in sight
Nought but the heavy sea , and coming night

At mercy of the waves , whose mercies are
Like human beings during civil war

But he , poor fellow , had a wife and children
Two things for dying people quite bewildering

That begg 'd Pedrillo for an absolution
Who told him to be damn 'd -- in his confusion

That a tight boat will live in a rough sea
Unless with breakers close beneath her lee

Two casks of biscuit and a keg of butter
Were all that could be thrown into the cutter

But scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon
Then there was rum , eight gallons in a puncheon

And two boats could not hold , far less be stored
To save one half the people then on board

And the dim desolate deep : twelve days had Fear
Been their familiar , and now Death was here

Half epileptical and half hysterical
Their preservation would have been a miracle

She gave a heel , and then a lurch to port
And , going down head foremost -- sunk , in short

Like one who grapples with his enemy
And strives to strangle him before he die

A solitary shriek , the bubbling cry
Of some strong swimmer in his agony

Nine in the cutter , thirty in the boat
Were counted in them when they got afloat

They wo n't lay out their money on the dead
It costs three francs for every mass that 's said

Battista ; though ( a name call 'd shortly Tita
Was lost by getting at some aqua-vita

Because the sea ran higher every minute
And for the boat -- the crew kept crowding in it

And Juan caught him up , and ere he stepped
Off , threw him in , then after him he leaped

And deeming there were remedies for any ill
Thus re-embark 'd his tutor and his spaniel

So that themselves as well as hopes were damped
And the poor little cutter quickly swamped

They grieved for those who perish 'd with the cutter
And also for the biscuit-casks and butter

To faint , and damaged bread wet through the bags
And most of them had little clothes but rags

Ague in its cold fit , they fill 'd their boat
With nothing but the sky for a great coat

Despair of all recovery spoils longevity
And makes men miseries miseries of alarming brevity

In my young days they lent me cash that way
Which I found very troublesome to pay

She had a curious crew as well as cargo
Like the first old Greek privateer , the Argo

Your labouring people think beyond all question
Beef , veal , and mutton , better for digestion

And fell all ravenously on their provision
Instead of hoarding it with due precision

But as they had but one oar , and that brittle
It would have been more wise to save their victual

So Juan 's spaniel , spite of his entreating
Was kill 'd and portion 'd out for present eating

Which he divided with Pedrillo , who
Devour 'd it , longing for the other too

The longings of the cannibal arise
( Although they spoke not ) in their wolfish eyes

And out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood
And who should die to be his fellow 's food

Having no paper , for the want of better
They took by force from Juan Julia 's letter

By which none were permitted to be neuter
And the lot fell on Juan 's luckless tutor

And first a little crucifix he kissed
And then held out his jugular and wrist

Regaled two sharks , who follow 'd o'er the billow
The sailors ate the rest of poor Pedrillo

Even in extremity of their disaster
Dine with them on his pastor and his master

Tearing , and grinning , howling , screeching , swearing
And , with hyaena-laughter , died despairing

Who had already perish 'd , suffering madly
For having used their appetites so sadly

Was a small present made to him at Cadiz
By general subscription of the ladies

At length they caught two boobies and a noddy
And then they left off eating the dead body

When shipwreck 's short allowance grows too scanty
Without being much more horrible than Dante

Or in the desert heard the camel 's bell
You 'd wish yourself where Truth is -- in a well

As a full pot of porter , to their thinking
They ne'er till now had known the joys of drinking

To taste of heaven -- If this be true , indeed
Some Christians have a comfortable creed

I can do nothing , ' and he saw him thrown
Into the deep without a tear or groan

He saw increasing on his father 's heart
With the deep deadly thought that they must part

He squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain
Into his dying child 's mouth -- but in vain

Then he himself sunk down all dumb and shivering
And gave no sign of life , save his limbs quivering

Then changed like to a bow that 's bent , and then
Forsook the dim eyes of these shipwreck 'd men

Just like a black eye in a recent scuffle
( For sometimes we must box without the muffle

Than these , and so this rainbow look 'd like hope
Quite a celestial kaleidoscope

It came and went , and flutter 'd round them till
Night fell : this seem 'd a better omen still

Which in their way that moment chanced to fall
They would have eat her , olive-branch and all

Some swore that they heard breakers , others guns
And all mistook about the latter once

For shore it was , and gradually grew
Distinct , and high , and palpable to view

Asleep : they shook them by the hand and head
And tried to awaken them , but found them dead

They thought that in such perils , more than chance
Had sent them this for their deliverance

Some thought it was Mount AEtna , some the highlands
Of Candia , Cyprus , Rhodes , or other islands

Though the two sharks still follow 'd them , and dashed
The spray into their faces as they splashed

But chiefly by a species of self-slaughter
In washing down Pedrillo with salt water

Lovely seem 'd any object that should sweep
Away the vast , salt , dread , eternal deep

But finding no place for their landing better
They ran the boat for shore , -- and overset her

As once ( a feat on which ourselves we prided
Leander , Mr. Ekenhead , and I did

As for the other two , they could not swim
So nobody arrived on shore but him

At last , with swimming , wading , scrambling , he
Roll 'd on the beach , half-senseless , from the sea

With just enough of life to feel its pain
And deem that it was saved , perhaps in vain

Who died two days before , and now had found
An unknown barren beach for burial ground

His slender frame and pallid aspect lay
As fair a thing as e'er was form 'd of clay

And tingling vein , seem 'd throbbing back to life
For Death , though vanquish 'd , still retired with strife

And slowly by his swimming eyes was seen
A lovely female face of seventeen

Its gentle touch and trembling care , a sigh
To these kind efforts made a low reply

And watch 'd with eagerness each throb that drew
A sigh from his heaved bosom -- and hers , too

Had never seen , the maid , or whatsoe'er
She was , appear 'd distinct , and tall , and fair

There was a something which bespoke command
As one who was a lady in the land

'T is as the snake late coil 'd , who pours his length
And hurls at once his venom and his strength

I 've seen much finer women , ripe and real
Than all the nonsense of their stone ideal

They will destroy a face which mortal thought
Ne'er compass 'd , nor less mortal chisel wrought

The basquina and the mantilla , they
Seem at the same time mystical and gay

Flash 'd on her little hand ; but , what was shocking
Her small snow feet had slippers , but no stocking

Her hair was thicker , but less long ; her eyes
As black , but quicker , and of smaller size

But the best dish that e'er was cook 'd since Homer 's
Achilles ordered dinner for new comers

Mistress and maid ; the first was only daughter
Of an old man who lived upon the water

Left him , at last , the sole of many masters
Of an ill-gotten million of piastres

Full many a morsel for that Turkish trade
By which , no doubt , a good deal may be made

But this I know , it was a spacious building
Full of barbaric carving , paint , and gilding

Rejected several suitors , just to learn
How to accept a better in his turn

As far as in her lay , 'to take him in
A stranger ' dying , with so white a skin

He would have hospitably cured the stranger
And sold him instantly when out of danger

It open 'd half the turnpike-gates to heaven
( St. Paul says , 't is the toll which must be given

But , by God 's grace , here wrecks were in such plenty
That there was fuel to have furnish 'd twenty

To pay him a fresh visit , with a dish
For breakfast , of eggs , coffee , bread , and fish

Unwelcome visions of our former years
Till the eye , cheated , opens thick with tears

He had pronounced her name -- but she forgot
That at this moment Juan knew it not

In gaining all that useful sort of knowledge
Which is acquired in Nature 's good old college

Had suffer 'd more -- his hardships were comparative
To those related in my grand-dad 's 'Narrative

In several oaths -- Armenian , Turk , and Greek
They knew not what to think of such a freak

And night is flung off like a mourning suit
Worn for a husband , -- or some other brute

From daybreak , and when coffin 'd at fourscore
Engrave upon the plate , you rose at four

Checks to a lake , whose waves in circles spread
Or the Red Sea -- but the sea is not red

Although the mortal , quite as fresh and fair
Had all the advantage , too , of not being air

Should reach his blood , then o'er him still as death
Bent with hush 'd lips , that drank his scarce-drawn breath

Must breakfast -- and betimes , lest they should ask it
She drew out her provision from the basket

But there were eggs , fruit , coffee , bread , fish , honey
With Scio wine , -- and all for love , not money

Because her mistress would not let her break
That sleep which seem 'd as it would ne'er awake

Which weigh 'd upon them yet , all damp and salt
Mix 'd with the stony vapours of the vault

In short , he was a very pretty fellow
Although his woes had turn 'd him rather yellow

He turn 'd from grisly saints , and martyrs hairy
To the sweet portraits of the Virgin Mary

With an Ionian accent , low and sweet
That he was faint , and must not talk , but eat

Without knowing why -- an overpowering tone
Whence Melody descends as from a throne

Who like a morning slumber -- for the night
Shows stars and women in a better light

To stir her viands , made him quite awake
And long for food , but chiefly a beef-steak

Others are fair and fertile , among which
This , though not large , was one of the most rich

That Pasiphae promoted breeding cattle
To make the Cretans bloodier in battle

So were the Cretans -- from which I infer
That beef and battles both were owing to her

He fell upon whate'er was offer 'd , like
A priest , a shark , an alderman , or pike

That famish 'd people must be slowly nurst
And fed by spoonfuls , else they always burst

She snatch 'd it , and refused another morsel
Saying , he had gorged enough to make a horse ill

They furnish 'd him , entire , except some stitches
With a clean shirt , and very spacious breeches

Till pausing at the last her breath to take
She saw he did not understand Romaic

And thus in every look she saw exprest
A world of words , and things at which she guessed

Thus Juan learn 'd his alpha beta better
From Haidee 's glance than any graven letter

Pressure of hands , perhaps even a chaste kiss
I learn 'd the little that I know by this

Of eloquence in piety and prose
I hate your poets , so read none of those

Foes , friends , men , women , now are nought to me
But dreams of what has been , no more to be

With a young benefactress , -- so was she
Just in the way we very often see

Breathing all gently o'er his cheek and mouth
As o'er a bed of roses the sweet south

Are also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus
Without whom Venus will not long attack us

But who is their purveyor from above
Heaven knows , -- it may be Neptune , Pan , or Jove

Well -- Juan , after bathing in the sea
Came always back to coffee and Haidee

To render happy ; all who joy would win
Must share it , -- Happiness was born a twin

He was her own , her ocean-treasure , cast
Like a rich wreck -- her first love , and her last

Not as of yore to carry off an Io
But three Ragusan vessels , bound for Scio

I speak of Christian lands in this comparison
Where wives , at least , are seldom kept in garrison

And thus they walk 'd out in the afternoon
And saw the sun set opposite the moon

Save on the dead long summer days , which make
The outstretch 'd ocean glitter like a lake

Let us have wine and women , mirth and laughter
Sermons and soda-water the day after

But to return , -- Get very drunk ; and when
You wake with headache , you shall see what then

After long travel , ennui , love , or slaughter
Vie with that draught of hock and soda-water

By some low rock or shelve , that made it fret
Against the boundary it scarcely wet

Bringing warm water , wreathing her long tresses
And asking now and then for cast-off dresses

Upon the other , and the rosy sky
With one star sparkling through it like an eye

They turn 'd to rest ; and , each clasp 'd by an arm
Yielded to the deep twilight 's purple charm

Into each other -- and , beholding this
Their lips drew near , and clung into a kiss

Each kiss a heart-quake , -- for a kiss 's strength
I think , it must be reckon 'd by its length

Which , being join 'd , like swarming bees they clung
Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung

As if there were no life beneath the sky
Save theirs , and that their life could never die

Of nature 's oracle -- first love , -- that all
Which Eve has left her daughters since her fall

And , never having dreamt of falsehood , she
Had not one word to say of constancy

And , beating 'gainst his bosom , Haidee 's heart
Felt as if never more to beat apart

Of hell-fire -- all prepared for people giving
Pleasure or pain to one another living

And hell and purgatory -- but forgot
Just in the very crisis she should not

And thus they form a group that 's quite antique
Half naked , loving , natural , and Greek

Pillow 'd on her o'erflowing heart , which pants
With all it granted , and with all it grants

Feel rapture ; but not such true joy are reaping
As they who watch o'er what they love while sleeping

There lies the thing we love with all its errors
And all its charms , like death without its terrors

And all the stars that crowded the blue space
Saw nothing happier than her glowing face

Deadly , and quick , and crushing ; yet , as real
Torture is theirs , what they inflict they feel

A thankless husband , next a faithless lover
Then dressing , nursing , praying , and all 's over

From the dull palace to the dirty hovel
Some play the devil , and then write a novel

Elsewhere was nothing . She had naught to fear
Hope , care , nor love , beyond , her heart beat here

To make us understand each good old maxim
So good -- I wonder Castlereagh do n't tax 'em

And they were happy , for to their young eyes
Each was an angel , and earth paradise

O , Love ! thou art the very god of evil
For , after all , we can not call thee devil

Yet to these four in three things the same luck holds
They all were heroes , conquerors , and cuckolds

'Eat , drink , and love , what can the rest avail us
So said the royal sage Sardanapalus

Else how the devil is it that fresh features
Have such a charm for us poor human creatures

I saw the prettiest creature , fresh from Milan
Which gave me some sensations like a villain

'Stop ! ' cried Philosophy , with air so Grecian
( Though she was masqued then as a fair Venetian

This sort of adoration of the real
Is but a heightening of the 'beau ideal

With one or two small senses added , just
To hint that flesh is form 'd of fiery dust

Whereas if one sole lady pleased for ever
How pleasant for the heart as well as liver

Pours forth at last the heart 's blood turn 'd to tears
Which make the English climate of our years

So that all mischiefs spring up from this entrail
Like earthquakes from the hidden fire call 'd 'central

Leaving Don Juan and Haidee to plead
For them and theirs with all who deign to read

Had soil 'd the current of her sinless years
And turn 'd her pure heart 's purest blood to tears

Thus the frail beings we would fondly cherish
Are laid within our bosoms but to perish

She then prefers him in the plural number
Not finding that the additions much encumber

Yet there are some , they say , who have had none
But those who have ne'er end with only one

Is sharpen 'd from its high celestial flavour
Down to a very homely household savour

For instance -- passion in a lover 's glorious
But in a husband is pronounced uxorious

Sad thought ! to lose the spouse that was adorning
Our days , and put one 's servants into mourning

Think you , if Laura had been Petrarch 's wife
He would have written sonnets all his life

So leaving each their priest and prayer-book ready
They say no more of Death or of the Lady

But Dante 's Beatrice and Milton 's Eve
Were not drawn from their spouses , you conceive

I think that Dante 's more abstruse ecstatics
Meant to personify the mathematics

Before the consequences grow too awful
'T is dangerous to read of loves unlawful

Thus she came often , not a moment losing
Whilst her piratical papa was cruising

Pursued o'er the high seas his watery journey
And merely practised as a sea-attorney

In number 'd lots ; they all had cuffs and collars
And averaged each from ten to a hundred dollars

Were link 'd alike , as for the common people he
Had a large order from the Dey of Tripoli

All which selected from the spoil he gathers
Robb 'd for his daughter by the best of fathers

These to secure in this strong blowing weather
He caged in one huge hamper altogether

And rough with reefs which ran out many a mile
His port lay on the other side o ' the isle

So that all hands were busy beyond measure
In getting out goods , ballast , guns , and treasure

All feelings which o'erleap the years long lost
And bring our hearts back to their starting-post

Wives in their husbands ' absences grow subtler
And daughters sometimes run off with the butler

Born to some friend , who holds his wife and riches
And that his Argus -- bites him by the breeches

And that his sorrow may not be a dumb one
Write odes on the Inconstancy of Woman

Yet for all that keep not too long away
I 've known the absent wrong 'd four times a day

He loved his child , and would have wept the loss of her
But knew the cause no more than a philosopher

Of arms ( in the East all arm ) -- and various dyes
Of colour 'd garbs , as bright as butterflies

A pipe , too , and a drum , and shortly after
A most unoriental roar of laughter

Perceived it was the Pyrrhic dance so martial
To which the Levantines are very partial

Their leader sang -- and bounded to her song
With choral step and voice , the virgin throng

The orange and pomegranate nodding o'er
Dropp 'd in their laps , scarce pluck 'd , their mellow store

His brow , as if in act to butt , and then
Yielding to their small hands , draws back again

So that the philosophical beholder
Sigh 'd for their sakes -- that they should e'er grow older

Of magic ladies who , by one sole act
Transform 'd their lords to beasts ( but that 's a fact

Dreading that climax of all human ills
The inflammation of his weekly bills

Lambro 's reception at his people 's banquet
Was such as fire accords to a wet blanket

In fact much more astonish 'd than delighted
To find so much good company invited

Her tears , too , being return 'd into their fount
She now kept house upon her own account

'T was wonderful how things went on improving
While she had not one hour to spare from loving

And that , proceeding at a very high rate
He show 'd the royal penchants of a pirate

Pity he loved adventurous life 's variety
He was so great a loss to good society

His question , much too merry to divine
The questioner , fill 'd up a glass of wine

'Our mistress ! ' quoth a third : 'Our mistress ! -- pooh
You mean our master -- not the old , but new

The name and quality of his new patron
Who seem 'd to have turn 'd Haidee into a matron

He 'll answer all for better or for worse
For none likes more to hear himself converse

The insults , too , of every servile glutton
Who all the time was eating up his mutton

Though doubtless he who can command himself
Is good to govern -- almost as a Guelf

But in his silence there was much to rue
And his one blow left little work for two

But certainly to one deem 'd dead , returning
This revel seem 'd a curious mode of mourning

Tears shed into the grave of the connection
Would share most probably its resurrection

The ashes of our hopes , is a deep grief
Beyond a single gentleman 's belief

Over the innocence of that sweet child
His only shrine of feelings undefiled

His country 's wrongs and his despair to save her
Had stung him from a slave to an enslaver

Had cost his enemies a long repentance
And made him a good friend , but bad acquaintance

Hate to the world and war with every nation
He waged , in vengeance of her degradation

Past him in crystal , and a joy in flowers
Bedew 'd his spirit in his calmer hours

His feelings from all milk of human kindness
And turn him like the Cyclops mad with blindness

Than the stern , single , deep , and wordless ire
Of a strong human heart , and in a sire

They kindly leave us , though not quite alone
But in good company -- the gout or stone

A lady with her daughters or her nieces
Shines like a guinea and seven-shilling pieces

Gems , gold , and silver , form 'd the service mostly
Mother of pearl and coral the less costly

Of raisin , orange , and pomegranate juice
Squeezed through the rind , which makes it best for use

Cloves , cinnamon , and saffron too were boiled
Up with the coffee , which ( I think ) they spoiled

Soft Persian sentences , in lilac letters
From poets , or the moralists their betters

Though sages may pour out their wisdom 's treasure
There is no sterner moralist than Pleasure

And show that late hours , wine , and love are able
To do not much less damage than the table

A sun emboss 'd in gold , whose rays of tissue
Meridian-like , were seen all light to issue

To say , by degradation ) mingled there
As plentiful as in a court , or fair

With viands and sherbets in ice -- and wine
Kept for all comers at all hours to dine

And the striped white gauze baracan that bound her
Like fleecy clouds about the moon , flow 'd round her

The purest ore enclosed the whitest skin
That e'er by precious metal was held in

Her orange silk full Turkish trousers furled
About the prettiest ankle in the world

Their bonds whene'er some Zephyr caught began
To offer his young pinion as her fan

Her overpowering presence made you feel
It would not be idolatry to kneel

The power of art was turn 'd to nothing , for
They could not look more rosy than before

But Shakspeare also says , 't is very silly
'To gild refined gold , or paint the lily

Surmounted as its clasp -- a glowing crescent
Whose rays shone ever trembling , but incessant

He being paid to satirize or flatter
As the psalm says , 'inditing a good matter

But now he sung the Sultan and the Pacha
With truth like Southey , and with verse like Crashaw

He lied with such a fervour of intention
There was no doubt he earn 'd his laureate pension

Their loves , and feasts , and house , and dress , and mode
Of living in their insular abode

The glorious meed of popular applause
Of which the first ne'er knows the second cause

And , singing as he sung in his warm youth
Agree to a short armistice with truth

To 'do at Rome as Romans do , ' a piece
Of conduct was which he observed in Greece

If Pindar sang horse-races , what should hinder
Himself from being as pliable as Pindar

In Italy he 'd ape the 'Trecentisti
In Greece , he sing some sort of hymn like this t ' ye

Eternal summer gilds them yet
But all , except their sun , is set

To sounds which echo further west
Than your sires ' 'Islands of the Blest

For standing on the Persians ' grave
I could not deem myself a slave

He counted them at break of day
And when the sun set where were they

And must thy lyre , so long divine
Degenerate into hands like mine

For what is left the poet here
For Greeks a blush -- for Greece a tear

Of the three hundred grant but three
To make a new Thermopylae

But one arise , -- we come , we come
'T is but the living who are dumb

Hark ! rising to the ignoble call
How answers each bold Bacchanal

You have the letters Cadmus gave
Think ye he meant them for a slave

A tyrant ; but our masters then
Were still , at least , our countrymen

Another despot of the kind
Such chains as his were sure to bind

And there , perhaps , some seed is sown
The Heracleidan blood might own

But Turkish force , and Latin fraud
Would break your shield , however broad

My own the burning tear-drop laves
To think such breasts must suckle slaves

A land of slaves shall ne'er be mine
Dash down yon cup of Samian wine

Of others ' feeling ; but they are such liars
And take all colours -- like the hands of dyers

Frail man , when paper -- even a rag like this
Survives himself , his tomb , and all that 's his

In digging the foundation of a closet
May turn his name up , as a rare deposit

To the great Marlborough 's skill in giving knocks
Until his late life by Archdeacon Coxe

Was whipt at college -- a harsh sire -- odd spouse
For the first Mrs. Milton left his house

As most essential to their hero 's story
They do not much contribute to his glory

When he and Southey , following the same path
Espoused two partners ( milliners of Bath

A drowsy frowzy poem , call 'd the 'Excursion
Writ in a manner which is my aversion

And the new births of both their stale virginities
Have proved but dropsies , taken for divinities

Forgetting each omission is a loss to
The world , not quite so great as Ariosto

Some fine examples of the epopee
To prove its grand ingredient is ennui

Another outcry for ' a little boat
And drivels seas to set it well afloat

And he must needs mount nearer to the moon
Could not the blockhead ask for a balloon

The 'little boatman ' and his 'Peter Bell
Can sneer at him who drew 'Achitophel

Ave Maria ! o'er the earth and sea
That heavenliest hour of Heaven is worthiest thee

And not a breath crept through the rosy air
And yet the forest leaves seem 'd stirr 'd with prayer

What though 't is but a pictured image ? -- strike
That painting is no idol , -- 't is too like

Earth , air , stars , -- all that springs from the great Whole
Who hath produced , and will receive the soul

And Dryden 's lay made haunted ground to me
How have I loved the twilight hour and thee

Which learn 'd from this example not to fly
From a true lover , -- shadow 'd my mind 's eye

Are gather 'd round us by thy look of rest
Thou bring'st the child , too , to the mother 's breast

Is this a fancy which our reason scorns
Ah ! surely nothing dies but something mourns

Of feeling for some kindness done , when power
Had left the wretch an uncorrupted hour

Of verse ( the name with which we Cantabs please
To dub the last of honours in degrees

I 'll prove that such the opinion of the critic is
From Aristotle passim. -- See poietikes

Being pride , which leads the mind to soar too far
Till our own weakness shows us what we are

But as the torrent widens towards the ocean
We ponder deeply on each past emotion

And the sad truth which hovers o'er my desk
Turns what was once romantic to burlesque

Thetis baptized her mortal son in Styx
A mortal mother would on Lethe fix

Unless it were to be a moment merry
A novel word in my vocabulary

But all these , save the last , being obsolete
I chose a modern subject as more meet

Meantime Apollo plucks me by the ear
And tells me to resume my story here

Meant to grow old , but die in happy spring
Before one charm or hope had taken wing

A long and snake-like life of dull decay
Was not for themÃ‘they had too little day

Would wither less than these two torn apart
Alas ! there is no instinct like the heartÃ‘

While life 's strange principle will often lie
Deepest in those who long the most to die

The old archer 's shafts , perhaps the early grave
Which men weep over may be meant to save

And knew such brightness was but the reflection
Of their exchanging glances of affection

Sweet playful phrases , which would seem absurd
To those who have ceased to hear such , or ne'er heard , Ã‘

To pass their lives in fountains and on flowers
And never know the weight of human hours

Most love , possession , unto them appeared
A thing which each endearment more endeared

Where Hymen 's torch but brands one strumpet more
Whose husband only knows her not a whÃ‘re

InherentÃ‘what we mortals call romantic
And always envy , though we deem it frantic

So that there was no reason for their loves
More than for those of nightingales or doves

Charm 'd with each other , all things charm 'd that brought
The past still welcome as the present thought

And call 'd from Juan 's breast a faint low sigh
While one new tear arose in Haidee 's eye

His glance inquired of hers for some excuse
For feelings causeless , or at least abstruse

'If it should be so , Ã‘butÃ‘it can not beÃ‘
Or I at least shall not survive to see

I have tried both ; so those who would a part take
May choose between the headache and the heartache

And then decide , without great wrong to either
It were much better to have both than neither

But almost sanctify the sweet excess
By the immortal wish and power to bless

Love was born with them , in them , so intense
It was their very spiritÃ‘not a sense

The eagle soars alone ; the gull and crow
Flock o'er their carrion , just like men below

A wordless music , and her face so fair
Stirr 'd with her dream , as rose-leaves with the air

Strange state of being ! ( for 't is still to be
Senseless to feel , and with seal 'd eyes to see

Foaming o'er her lone head , so fierce and highÃ‘
Each broke to drown her , yet she could not die

Her glance nor grasp , for still she gazed , and grasped
And ran , but it escaped her as she clasped

The sharp rocks look 'd below each drop they caught
Which froze to marble as it fell , Ã‘she thought

Rang in her sad ears like a mermaid 's song
And that brief dream appear 'd a life too long

O ! Powers of Heaven ! what dark eye meets she there
'T isÃ‘'t is her father'sÃ‘fix 'd upon the pair

It was a moment of that awful kindÃ‘
I have seen suchÃ‘but must not call to mind

A thousand scimitars await the word
Put up , young man , put up your silly sword

That doubt should mingle with my filial joy
Deal with me as thou wilt , but spare this boy

In arms , at least , he stood , in act to spring
On the first foe whom Lambro 's call might bring

'T was freshÃ‘for he had lately used the lockÃ‘
And next proceeded quietly to cock

But after being fired at once or twice
The ear becomes more Irish , and less nice

I love himÃ‘I will die with him : I knew
Your nature 's firmnessÃ‘know your daughter 's too

A fairer mark ; and with a fix 'd eye scanned
Her father 's faceÃ‘but never stopp 'd his hand

Her father 's blood before her father 's face
Boil 'd up , and proved her truly of his race

And sweet sensations should have welcomed both
Show what the passions are in their full growth

But I must do my dutyÃ‘how thou hast
Done thine , the present vouches for the past

Some twenty of his train came , rank on rank
He gave the word , Ã‘'Arrest or slay the Frank

The file of pirates ; save the foremost , who
Had fallen , with his right shoulder half cut through

From two smart sabre gashes , deep and redÃ‘
One on the arm , the other on the head

On board of one of these , and under hatches
They stow 'd him , with strict orders to the watches

Wounded and chain 'd , so that he can not move
And all because a lady fell in love

'T is pity wine should be so deleterious
For tea and coffee leave us much more serious

My mild and midnight beakers to the brim
Wakes me next morning with its synonym

Her mother was a Moorish maid , from Fez
Where all is Eden , or a wilderness

Or heaving whelm the helpless caravan
And as the soil is , so the heart of man

But her large dark eye show 'd deep Passion 's force
Though sleeping like a lion near a source

The fire burst forth from her Numidian veins
Even as the Simoom sweeps the blasted plains

On her sire 's arm , which until now scarce held
Her writhing , fell she like a cedar felled

But she defied all means they could employ
Like one life could not hold , nor death destroy

New thoughts of life , for it seem 'd full of soulÃ‘
She had so much , earth could not claim the whole

Their energy like life forms all their fame
Yet looks not life , for they are still the same

Brought back the sense of pain without the cause
For , for a while , the furies made a pause

Were tried in vain by those who served ; she gave
No sign , save breath , of having left the grave

At length those eyes , which they would fain be weaning
Back to old thoughts , wax 'd full of fearful meaning

And he begun a long low island song
Of ancient days , ere tyranny grew strong

The tears rush 'd forth from her o'erclouded brain
Like mountain mists at length dissolved in rain

Hers was a phrensy which disdain 'd to rave
Even when they smote her , in the hope to save

Nor time , nor skill , nor remedy , could give her
Senses to sleepÃ‘the power seem 'd gone for ever

Glazed o'er her eyesÃ‘the beautiful , the blackÃ‘
O ! to possess such lustreÃ‘and then lack

In vain the dews of Heaven descend above
The bleeding flower and blasted fruit of love

Long with her destiny ; but she sleeps well
By the sea-shore , whereon she loved to dwell

What was ; no dirge , except the hollow sea 's
Mourns o'er the beauty of the Cyclades

In some shape ; let none think to fly the danger
For soon or late Love is his own avenger

We 'll put about , and try another tack
With Juan , left half-kill 'd some stanzas back

Another time he might have liked to see 'em
But now was not much pleased with Cape Sigaeum

Patroclus , Ajax , or ProtesilausÃ‘
All heroes , who if living still would slay us

With case ; but where I sought for Ilion 's walls
The quiet sheep feeds , and the tortoise crawls

Extremely taken with his own religion
Are what I found thereÃ‘but the devil a Phrygian

No very satisfactory information
About his past or present situation

In sailing from Livorno by the pirate
But sold by the impresario at no high rate

Showing a much more reconciled demeanour
Than did the prima donna and the tenor

But if the Sultan has a taste for song
We will revive our fortunes before long

By carrying off Count Cesare Cicogna
From an old Roman princess at Bologna

And then there 's the GrotescaÃ‘such a dancer
Where men have souls or bodies she must answer

Which might go far , but she do n't dance with vigour
The more 's the pity , with her face and figure

From all the Pope makes yearly 't would perplex
To find three perfect pipes of the third sex

They hired him , though to hear him you 'd believe
An ass was practising recitative

You was not last year at the fair of Lugo
But next , when I 'm engaged to sing thereÃ‘do go

In lovers ' parts his passion more to breathe
Having no heart to show , he shows his teeth

Dancing all free and happy in the sun
And then went down the hatchway one by one

Were to be chain 'd and lotted out per couple
For the slave market of Constantinople

Was Juan , Ã‘who , an awkward thing at his age
Pair 'd off with a Bacchante blooming visage

That each pull 'd different ways with many an oath
'Arcades ambo , ' id estÃ‘blackguards both

Great wish to pleaseÃ‘a most attractive dower
Especially when added to the power

Could stir his pulse , or make his faith feel brittle
Perhaps his recent wounds might help a little

I really think ; yet Juan 's then ordeal
Was more triumphant , and not much less real

Through needles ' eyes it easier for the camel is
To pass , than those two cantos into families

And recollect the time when all this cant
Would have provoked remarks which now it sha n't

The grass upon my grave will grow as long
And sigh to midnight winds , but not to song

Even till an iceberg it may chance to grow
But , after all , 't is nothing but cold snow

Save change : I 've stood upon Achilles ' tomb
And heard Troy doubted ; time will doubt of Rome

Which once-named myriads nameless lie beneath
And lose their own in universal death

Records Ravenna 's carnage on its face
While weeds and ordure rankle round the base

Will sink where lie the songs and wars of earth
Before Pelides ' death , or Homer 's birth

Instinct of gore and glory earth has known
Those sufferings Dante saw in hell alone

Dash into poetry , which is but passion
Or at least was so ere it grew a fashion

You may do right forbidding them to show 'em
But spoil ( I think ) a very pretty poem

Ah ! must I then the only minstrel be
Proscribed from tasting your Castalian tea

That taste is gone , that fame is but a lottery
Drawn by the blue-coat misses of a coterie

Round the Patrician left-legs , which adorn
The festal midnight , and the levee morn

I knew one woman of that purple school
The loveliest , chastest , best , butÃ‘quite a fool

By measuring 'the intensity of blue
O , Lady Daphne ! let me measure you

And there with Georgians , Russians , and Circassians
Bought up for different purposes and passions

But when the offer went beyond , they knew
'T was for the Sultan , and at once withdrew

The virtues , even the most exalted , Charity
Are savingÃ‘vice spares nothing for a rarity

The females stood , as one by one they pick 'd 'em
To make a mistress , or fourth wife , or victim

And now delay the progress of Don Juan
Till what is call 'd in Ossian the fifth Juan

O SNATCHÃ•D away in beautyÃ•s bloom
On thee shall press no ponderous tomb

But on thy turf shall roses rear
Their leaves , the earliest of the year

And lingering pause and lightly tread
Fond wretch ! as if her step disturbÃ•d the dead

And thou , who tellÃ•st me to forget
Thy looks are wan , thine eyes are wet

MAID of Athens , ere we part
Give , oh , give me back my heart

Or , since that has left my breast
Keep it now , and take the rest

By those tresses unconfined
WooÃ•d by each Â®gean wind

By those lids whose jetty fringe
Kiss thy soft cheeksÃ• blooming tinge

By that lip I long to taste
By that zone-encircled waist

By all the token-flowers that tell
What words can never speak so well

Maid of Athens ! I am gone
Think of me , sweet ! when alone

Though I fly to Istambol
Athens holds my heart and soul

Have strewÃ•d a scene , which I should see
With double joy wert thou with me

But one thing want these banks of Rhine , Ã‘
Thy gentle hand to clasp in mine

And knowÃ•st them gatherÃ•d by the Rhine
And offerÃ•d from my heart to thine

Could thy dear eyes in following mine
Still sweeten more these banks of Rhine

Brightest in dungeons , Liberty , thou art , Ã‘
For there thy habitation is the heartÃ‘

To fetters , and the damp vaultÃ•s dayless gloom
Their country conquers with their martyrdom

WARRIORS and chiefs ! should the shaft or the sword
Pierce me in leading the host of the Lord

Heed not the corse , though a kingÃ•s in your path
Bury your steel in the bosoms of Gath

Thou who art bearing my buckler and bow
Should the soldiers of Saul look away from the foe

Stretch me that moment in blood at thy feet
Mine be the doom which they dared not to meet

Farewell to others , but never we part
Heir to my royalty , son of my heart

Bright is the diadem , boundless the sway
Or kingly the death , which awaits us to-day

Though Earth received them in her bed
And oÃ•er the spot the crowd may tread

There is an eye which could not brook
A moment on that grave to look

It is enough for me to prove
That what I loved , and long must love

To me there needs no stone to tell
Ã•Tis Nothing that I loved so well

The love where Death has set his seal
Nor age can chill , nor rival steal

And , what were worse , thou canst not see
Or wrong , or change , or fault in me

The silence of that dreamless sleep
I envy now too much to weep

That all those charms have passÃ•d away
I might have watchÃ•d through long decay

And yet it were a greater grief
To watch it withering , leaf by leaf

Since earthly eye but ill can bear
To trace the change to foul from fair

Thy day without a cloud hath past
And thou wert lovely to the last

As stars that shoot along the sky
Shine brightest as they fall from high

To gaze , how fondly ! on thy face
To fold thee in a faint embrace

And show that love , however vain
Nor thou nor I can feel again

The all of thine that can not die
Through dark and dread Eternity

And more thy buried love endears
Than aught except its living years

THEREÃ•S not a joy the world can give like that it takes away
When the glow of early thought declines in feelingÃ•s dull decay

Ã•Tis not on youthÃ•s smooth cheek the blush alone , which fades so fast
But the tender bloom of heart is gone , ere youth itself be past

Then the few whose spirits float above the wreck of happiness
Are driven oÃ•er the shoals of guilt , or ocean of excess

The magnet of their course is gone , or only points in vain
The shore to which their shiverÃ•d sail shall never stretch again

Then the mortal coldness of the soul like death itself comes down
It can not feel for othersÃ• woes , it dare not dream its own

That heavy chill has frozen oÃ•er the fountain of our tears
And though the eye may sparkle still , Ã•tis where the ice appears

Though wit may flash from fluent lips , and mirth distract the breast
Through midnight hours that yield no more their former hope of rest

Ã•Tis but as ivy-leaves around the ruinÃ•d turret wreathe
All green and wildly fresh without , but worn and gray beneath

O could I feel as I have felt , or be what I have been
Or weep as I could once have wept oÃ•er many a vanishÃ•d scene , Ã‘

As springs in deserts found seem sweet , all brackish though they be
So midst the witherÃ•d waste of life , those tears would flow to me

Why bend above a shapeless shroud
Seeking in such archaic cloud

Why should one idle spade , I wonder
Shake up the dust of thanes like thunder

These lords may light the mystery
Of mastery or victory

We shall not wake with ballad strings
The good time of the smaller things

The England of that dawn remains
And this of Alfred and the Danes

And as he walked by an apple tree
There came green devils out of the sea

He also looked forth for an hour
On peopled plains and skies that lower

His century like a small dark cloud
Drifts far ; it is an eyeless crowd

We know he saw athwart the wreck
The sign that hangs about your neck

Since on you flaming without flaw
I saw the sign that Guthrum saw

And ` mid volcanic tints of night
Walked where they fought the unknown fight

And wander with a wandering star
The wandering heart of things that are

Past purpled forest and pearled foam
God 's winged pavilion free to roam

Across these days like deserts , when
Pride and a little scratching pen

Up the inhuman steeps of space
As on a staircase go in grace

And saw the smoke-hued hamlets , quaint
With Westland king and Westland saint

He saw the first oar break or bend
He saw heaven fall and the world end

As children of some second birth
Like a strange people left on earth

And the roads of the world that lead to Rome
Were filled with faces that moved like foam

Trees that are Titan flowers to see
And tiger skies , striped horribly

Where ancient eagles on its brink
Vast as archangels , gather and drink

Where a spell is laid upon life and lust
And the rain is changed to a silver dust

Hath blanched with fear all beasts and birds
As death and a shock of evil words

Swept ever around an inmost place
And the din of distant race on race

But Alfred up against them bare
And gripped the ground and grasped the air

With foemen leaning on his shield
And roaring on him when he reeled

And for one hour of panting peace
Ringed with a roar that would not cease

Who knew not of the arch or pen
Great , beautiful half-witted men

And hairy men , as huge as sin
With horned heads , came wading in

The world turned empty where they trod
They took the kindly cross of God

The whirlpool of the pagan sway
Had swirled his sires as sticks away

And even their ghosts in that great stress
Grew greyer and greyer , less and less

Returning as a wheel returns
Came ruin and the rain that burns

And he read , writ with an iron pen
That God had wearied of Wessex men

His mother sitting in Egbert 's hall
And a book she showed him , very small

In colours of such simple creed
All things sprang at him , sun and weed

Or like a friend 's face seen in a glass
He looked ; and there Our Lady was

Only she stood up straight and free
Between the flowers in Athelney

He rent and cast it at her feet
Where , after centuries , with slow feet

Not I would break the splendours barred
Or seek to know the thing they guard

If that which is for ever is
Or if our hearts shall break with bliss

Under some sad , green evening sky
Holding a ruined cross on high

The clouds ; or a serf of hut and croft
That sits by his hovel fire as oft

The heaviest hind may easily
Come silently and suddenly

May break the guard of the Three Kings
And see the dear and dreadful things

Heareth between star and other star
Through the door of the darkness fallen ajar

Men may uproot where worlds begin
Or read the name of the nameless sin

They trim sad lamps , they touch sad strings
Hearing the heavy purple wings

Where the perverse in pleasure pine
And men are weary of green wine

He only heard , still as he stood
Under the old night 's nodding hood

Singing about some cruel thing
Done by a great and smiling king

Singing what shameful things are done
Between the sunlit sea and the sun

The few that were alive to die
Laughing , as littered skulls that lie

Eldred , the Franklin by the sea
And Mark , the man from Italy

The smoke of evening food and ease
Rose like a blue tree in the trees

And Eldred 's tools were red with rust
And on his well was a green crust

And Eldred 's doors stood wide apart
For loitering foot or labouring cart

But all his friends , he signed and said
Were broken about Ethelred

Because the chiefs cry once again
As in all fights , that we shall gain

Friend , I will watch the certain things
Swine , and slow moons like silver rings

`` Nor bear I boast of scald or king
The thing I bear is a lesser thing

I call the muster of Wessex men
From grassy hamlet or ditch or den

For I go gathering Christian men
From sunken paving and ford and fen

` No more of comfort shall ye get
Save that the sky grows darker yet

Like some vast beast for mystery
He filled the room and porch and sky

Turning but once e'er the door was shut
Shouting to Eldred over his butt

And went on his way for other friends
Friends fallen of all the wide world 's ends

Good steadings to grey ashes gone
And a monk 's house white like a skeleton

Saw coloured pavements sink and fade
In flowers , and the windy colonnade

His skin was brown like buried gold
And of certain of his sires was told

His strange , stiff olives did not fail
And all the kings of the earth drank ale

Only the trees to toss and reel
The tribes to bicker , the beasts to squeal

And fronted with the Italian 's eye
Asking him of his whence and why

Who fled before the Danes of old
Who chaffered with the Danes with gold

Blazed , drenched with dawn and dew-empearled
While faintlier coloured , freshlier curled

Where would you meet ? For you must hold
Half Wiltshire and the White Horse wold

Inwards , and eastward drive him down
I doubt if you shall take the crown

Said Alfred , `` I will speak for you
As for myself , and call it true

And shouldering suddenly his spear
He faded like some elfin fear

But he leaned on his spear as on a staff
With might and little mood to laugh

In a great grey cave far off to the south
Where a thick green forest stopped the mouth

Where Usk , with mighty murmurings
Past Caerleon of the fallen kings

Where Patrick and Brandan westerly
Looked out at last on a landless sea

But his eyes grew often blind and bright
And the sea that rose in the rocks at night

Whether at feast or fight was he
He heard the noise of a nameless sea

`` I bring of Our Lady a lesson set
This -- that the sky grows darker yet

And cried , as rigidly he rose
`` And if the sea and sky be foes

And Alfred strode off rapidly
And Colan of the Sacred Tree

A mass-book mildewed , line by line
And weapons and a skin of wine

Severed the harp of all his goods
And there in the cool and soundless woods

In the twilight high and far and fell
Like the fiery terraces of hell

Whose lights of sacrilege and scorn
Ran around England red as morn

The old horse graven , God knows when
By gods or beasts or what things then

For it was ill scoured of the weed
And lichen and thorn could crawl and feed

Till a rally of Danes with shield and bill
Rolled drunk over the dome of the hill

And a beard curled right cunningly
Was Guthrum of the Northern Sea

With Harold , nephew of the King
And Ogier of the Stone and Sling

Whose flames anear him or aloof
Took hold of towers or walls of proof

Not harshly , but as one on high
On a marble pillar in the sky

And his hands hardened ; but he played
And leaving all later hates unsaid

Where England of the motley states
Deepens like a garden to the gates

Boiling all over Offa 's Dyke
What time a Wessex club could strike

A big youth , beardless like a child
Whom the new wine of war sent wild

Your chief was a bracelet-giver
But the red unbroken river

Nephew , let Elf retune the string
A boy must needs like bellowing

A thing forgotten , as long ago
When the gods forgot the mistletoe

The green plant groweth , menacing
Almighty lovers in the spring

Old he was , but his locks were red
And jests were all the words he said

But I go smelling yew and sods
And I know there are gods behind the gods

Well if the old man 's heart hath still
Wheels sped of rage and roaring will

When the taut rope parts under the pull
And the barest branch is beautiful

Though in black jest it bows and nods
Under the moons with silver rods

Above all moons made dark and riven
Hold up its foaming head in heaven

Shall know a new light in the mind
A noise about them and behind

But the hour shall come after his youth
When a man shall know not tales but truth

Do we not know , have we not heard
The soul is like a lost bird

He finds at last the lost bird dead
And a man may still lift up his head

When shrieking souls as shafts go by
And many have died and all may die

Because man hath not other power
Save that in dealing death for dower

And the owls moaned from the mighty trees
Till Alfred caught it to his knees

Why they be meek and monkish folk
And bow to the White Lord 's broken yoke

That though we scatter and though we fly
And you hang over us like the sky

But our king Alfred , lost from fame
Fallen among foes or bonds of shame

All things achieved and chosen pass
As the White Horse fades in the grass

The White Horse of the White Horse Vale
That you have left to darken and fail

Not for a fire in Ely fen
Not that your gods are nine or ten

What spirit with whom you blindly band
Hath blessed destruction with his hand

Rending among all roots that cling
And the wild horses whinnying

He marked the tilt of the pagan camp
The paling of pine , the sentries ' tramp

Whence ran across the heather grey
The old stones of a Roman way

And he thought how many a time had he
Sought to see Doom he could not see

With Ethelred praying in his tent
Till the white hawthorn swung and bent

Till all his lords lay dying
And axes on axes plying

Owls did as evil cherubs rise
With little wings and lantern eyes

Seeing the high forest domes and spars
Dim green or torn with golden scars

Mark from the towers of Italy
And Colan of the Sacred Tree

Echoing and empty seemed the place
But opened in a little space

And swordless , with his harp and rags
He seemed a beggar , such as lags

Said , when that she had glared a span
`` There is a cake for any man

Twilight shall melt and morning stir
And no kind thing shall come to her

Build this pavilion of the pines
And herd the fowls and fill the vines

From some primordial slumber torn
But all we living later born

They stretch stiff arms , the yawning trees
The beasts blink upon hands and knees

Save in faint figures and failing words
Who loves , yet laughs among the swords

And hate He had of prince and peer
And love He had and made good cheer

And cries that even in hedge and hill
Even on earth , it may go ill

But it seems to sing of a wilder worth
A time discrowned of doom and birth

Who shall go groaning to the grave
With many a meek and mighty slave

Yet these are sorry evermore
Unless there be a little door

And like his royal oath and rash
The good food fell upon the ash

And torture stood and the evil things
That are in the childish hearts of kings

Those friends creeping from far-off farms
Marcus with all his slaves in arms

Farm-hands and farm-beasts blundering by
And jars of mead and stores of rye

And straw clung to the spear-shafts tall
And a boy went before them all

Came like a bad king 's burial-end
With dismal robes that drop and rend

With Druid beards and Druid spears
As a resurrected race appears

So still each eye stood like a gem
So spectral hung each broidered hem

And heard and knew each in its mind
The third great thunder on the wind

Gurth , with rank hair like yellow grass
And the Cornish fisher , Gorlias

From red Arabia to the Tyne
The earth had heard that marching-line

Till shook aloud the lintel-beams
And the squirrels stirred in dusty dreams

On a stranger sight than a sylph or elf
On one man laughing at himself

Where greed is an ape and pride is an ass
And Jack 's away with his master 's lass

Of kings and clowns in a merry plight
And the clock gone wrong and the world gone right

In the van of the violent marching , then
When the sky is torn of the trumpets ten

On kings and earls of all degree
And armies wide as empires be

Before me rocking hosts be riven
And battering cohorts backwards driven

For this is the night of the drawing of swords
And the tainted tower of the heathen hordes

For we go gathering heathen men
A terrible harvest , ten by ten

For riseth up against realm and rod
A thing forgotten , a thing downtrod

Their torches tossed a ladder of fire
Higher their hymn was heard and higher

More sweet for hate and for heart 's desire
And up in the northern scrub and brier

Shrines without name or number
He rent and rolled as lumber

Come over the hills roaring
Above their roofs , and pouring

And turned him to a conquered land
And where the northern thornwoods stand

And though he prospered well , and knew
How Alfred 's folk were sad and few

And his foe must come with lean array
Up the left arm of the cloven way

The woods awoke with crash and cry
And the birds sprang clamouring harsh and high

The nests were noisy overhead
For Alfred and the star of red

And each with a small , far , bird-like sight
Saw the high folly of the fight

Then weakened every warrior 's mood
In hope , though not in hardihood

For the dear dead woman , crimson-clad
And the great feasts and the friends he had

And lay me under a Christian stone
In that lost land I thought my own

As fell his heavy words and few
And his eyes were of such alien blue

Next night a king may starve or sleep
But men and birds and beasts shall weep

The world grows stern and strange and new
And wise men shall govern you

My own dog will whine for me
My own friends will bend the knee

Having first pity , and after
Hearing , like rat in rafter

But you shall raid the whole land through
And never a tree shall talk to you

And fling the Golden Dragon out
With crackle and acclaim and shout

Past the sharp point of the cloven ways
Out from the black wood into the blaze

Midmost were Marcus and the King
And Eldred on the right-hand wing

Ten poles before their palisades
With wide-winged helms and runic blades

Where Guthrum and a few rode high
On horses seized in victory

With songs and spells that change the blood
And on the King 's right Harold stood

And the pleasant violence of the young
Pushed through his people , giving tongue

His beardless face broke into mirth
And he cried : `` What broken bits of earth

From some mean slave , and bent it on
Colan , whose doom grew dark ; and shone

He sent it splendid through the sky
Flying before the shaft could fly

Strove for a smile , put hand to head
Stumbled and suddenly fell dead

Cried out . Said Alfred : `` Who would see
Signs , must give all things . Verily

Unhooked their swords and held them up
Each offered to Colan , like a cup

For this is the manner of Christian men
Whether of steel or priestly pen

With a single shaft for a single prize
And the ultimate bolt that parts and flies

And the King took , with a random eye
A rude axe from a hind hard by

The first blood woke the trumpet-tune
As in monk 's rhyme or wizard 's rune

The two hosts shocked with dust and din
Left of the Latian paladin

And eastward of such central stir
Far to the right and faintlier

His hand like a windy hammer-stroke
Men could not count the crests he broke

Or tawny sand-winds tall and dry
Like hell 's red banners beat and fly

Down to the buried kingdoms creep
And like a lost rain roar and weep

Cast down from some unconquered town
That , rushing earthward , carries down

And the flank failed at the advance
For the death-light on the wizard lance

Stamp , Hildred hard in English land
Stand Gurth , stand Gorlias , Gawen stand

Even now your old thatch smoulders , Gurth
Now is the judgment of the earth

Leaned back and reeled a space to rear
As Elf charged with the Rhine maids ' spear

By dizzy plains and drifting sea
And they mixed God with glamoury

Where men can number and expound
And his faith grew in a hard ground

Went Elf roaring and routing
And Mark against Elf yet shouting

But the shield shifted never
The sword rang down to sever

Over the thrones of doom and blood
Goeth God that is a craftsman good

God of all good things done on earth
All wheels or webs of any worth

God of gold and flaming glass
Confregit potentias

All the sea-kings swayed among
Woods of the Wessex arms upflung

Lashing at Mark , who turned his blow
And brake the helm about his brow

But Mark set one foot on the shield
One on some sundered rock upheeled

Like birds about the battle-field
While Ogier writhed under his shield

With bare brute hand from the inside
He burst the shield of brass and hide

With level and imperial eye
And Mark , the man from Italy

On a river in spate is spun and swirled
Until we come to the end of the world

Shall stay us now that descend in thunder
Rending the realms and the realms thereunder

A dizzy throbbing , a drunkard smoke
That dazed to death all Wessex folk

For the King was beaten , blind , at bay
Down the right lane with his array

By night and furze and forest-harms
Far sundered were the friends in arms

As to the Haut King came at morn
Dead Roland on a doubtful horn

Played some small game through hours that pass
And patiently would pluck the grass

The child played on , alone , divine
As a child plays on the last line

Seeing on what morn of mystery
The Uncreated rent the sea

Piled up small stones to make a town
And evermore the stones fell down

Stretch hands , and hunger and aspire
Seeking to mount where high and higher

That of such smiters , wise or wild
He was least distant from the child

Came ruin and the rain that burns
Returning as a wheel returns

Heard roar of brass and ring of steel
The laughter and the trumpet peal

But the men seemed scattered in the brier
And some of them had lit a fire

Sat one upon a stone to sigh
And some slipped up the road to fly

One half-way through the thorn hedge tall
One with a leg across a wall

Two spears and a cloven war-shield lay
Loose on the road as cast away

Having hewn a chamber in a ditch
And hounded like a howling witch

No , brothers , by your leave , I think
Death is a better ale to drink

To see trees crouch and cattle slink
Death is a better ale to drink

Though all your thunder-sworded thanes
With proud hearts died among the Danes

When all their lords be lost and dead
The bondsmen of the earth shall tread

Then let all hell and Denmark drive
Yelling to all its fiends alive

Each in his place with club or spear
And fury deeper than deep fear

That Egbert blew in his empery
Once , when he rode out commonly

And I blew once , the riding sign
To call you to the fighting line

In such degree , by rule and rod
The people of the peace of God

When the broken shield hung on the breast
And the hopeless lance was laid in rest

For Our Lady stood on the standards rent
As lonely and as innocent

Her dress was soft as western sky
And she was a queen most womanly

Her eyes were sad withouten art
And seven swords were in her heart

The Danes closed round , a roaring ring
And twenty clubs rose o'er the King

Four Danes hewed at him , halloing
And Ogier of the Stone and Sling

The point stuck to a straggling tree
And either host cried suddenly

Kicked of such catapults of will
The staves shiver , the barrels spill

And slide on carnage clamorously
Down where the bitter blood doth lie

As a tide turns on the tall grey seas
See how they waver in the trees

And the storm-cloud drifts from city and dale
And the White Horse stamps in the White Horse Vale

And the psalm is roaring above the rune
And the Cross goes over the sun and moon

Too worn to take anew the tale
Or dazed with insolence and ale

More mighty in defeat was he
Than all men else in victory

Took Ludwig from his lady 's bower
And smote down Harmar in his hour

Wulf with his war-cry on his lips
And Harco born in the eclipse

And Cnut that melted Durham bell
And Fulk and fiery Oscar fell

When from the wood-road 's blackening throat
A crowning and crashing wonder smote

Had gathered and grown and heard the din
And with wild yells came pouring in

The body of the mighty lord
Colan of Caerleon and its horde

The wild pipes of the western land
Too keen for the ear to understand

And the wild sea-lords well might quail
As the ghastly war-pipes of the Gael

And Halmar laid three others low
And the great earls wavered to and fro

And cliffs of wan cloud luminous
Lean out like great walls over us

So did the eyes of Guthrum change
And the turn was more certain and more strange

Or the stars look up through the rent earth 's knees
Cometh such rending of certainties

And as ever had fallen fell his brand
A falling tower o'er many a land

There rose to the birds flying
A roar of dead and dying

Years following on that bloody boon
When she that stands above the moon

Nailed there with javelins to cling
And wonder smote the pirate king

And fierce new signs writ there to read
Shall eyes with such amazement heed

And a line was drawn north-westerly
That set King Egbert 's empire free

And the alms he gave as a Christian
Like a river alive with fishes ran

And many a thief in thorny nook
Or noble in sea-stained turret shook

On monsters that make boil the sea
Crakens and coils of mystery

Where the fish freeze and the foam turns black
And the wide world narrows to a track

Not to Rome only , but more bold
Out to the high hot courts of old

Where fiery plains stretch on and on
To the purple country of Prester John

Where in a night-rout , without name
Of gloomy Goths and Gauls there came

`` The steel that sang so sweet a tune
On Ashdown and on Ethandune

Three more such marches like thine own
Would end them ; and the Pict should own

But for one man whose eyes can see
The little island of Athelney

Out in the reedy waters wide
I had stood on my mud wall and cried

Had lined the banks by Athelney
And waved and wailed unceasingly

Like the gilt page the good monks pen
That is all smaller than a wren

An isle with utter clearness lit
Because a saint had stood in it

And I will make my fences tough
From Wantage Town to Plymouth Bluff

That as old customs in his sight
Were a straight road and a steady light

Of his old companions slain like kings
And the rich irrevocable things

And the frame of his face was made of cords
And a young lord turned among the lords

Crying : `` Arm , Lord King , the hamlets arm
In the horror and the shade of harm

The land wherein we pledge them gold
The dykes decay , the King grows old

He can not say to them he smote
And spared with a hand hard at the throat

But he only pointed : bade them heed
Those peasants of the Berkshire breed

Treason and shame shall come to pass
While one weed flowers in a morass

But ye shall know in a day or year
When one green star of grass grows here

And ring upon earth all evil 's knell
But now I wot if ye scour not well

Showed the first legions of the press
Marching in haste and bitterness

Rose men that owned King Alfred 's rod
From the windy wastes of Exe untrod

Plains beyond plains , fell beyond fell
That a man at sunset sees so well

The still-eyed King sat pondering
As one that watches a live thing

Though lordlier trees and lustier sod
And happier hills hath no flesh trod

And though they scatter now and go
In some far century , sad and slow

But ordering all things with dead words
Strings shall they make of beasts and birds

And backward shall ye turn and gaze
Desiring one of Alfred 's days

Earth lost and little like a pea
In high heaven 's towering forestry

Though they rear marvels over us
Greater than great Vergilius

By weird and weakness winning
Accursed from the beginning

Or charity or chivalry
My vision saith not ; and I see

While the levies thronged from near and far
From the warm woods of the western star

Climbed the old hills of his renown
Where the bald brow of White Horse Down

And a raid was driven athwart the raid
The sky reddened and the smoke swayed

The walls sank crowded , say the scribes
And high towers populous with tribes

And loud the sea-kings in the cloud
Broke through their dreaming gods , and loud

The turf crawled and the fungus crept
And the little sorrel , while all men slept

Crept on the large white commonweal
All folk had striven to strip and peel

Stood up in the pale purple sky
One turret of smoke like ivory

White founts falling in the courts of the sun
And the Soldan of Byzantium is smiling as they run

There is laughter like the fountains in that face of all men feared
It stirs the forest darkness , the darkness of his beard

It curls the blood-red crescent , the crescent of his lips
For the inmost sea of all the earth is shaken with his ships

They have dared the white republics up the capes of Italy
They have dashed the Adriatic round the Lion of the Sea

And the Pope has cast his arms abroad for agony and loss
And called the kings of Christendom for swords about the Cross

The cold queen of England is looking in the glass
The shadow of the Valois is yawning at the Mass

From evening isles , fantastical rings faint the Spanish gun
And the Lord upon the Golden Horn is laughing in the sun

Dim drums throbbing , in the hills half heard
Where only on a nameless throne a crownless prince has stirred

Where , risen from a doubtful seat and half-attainted stall
The last knight of Europe takes weapons from the wall

The last and lingering troubadour to whom the bird has sung
That once went singing southward when all the world was young

In that enormous silence , tiny and unafraid
Comes up along a winding road the noise of the Crusade

Strong gongs groaning as the guns boom far
Don John of Austria is going to the war

Stiff flags straining in the night-blasts cold
In the gloom black-purple , in the glint old-gold

Torchlight crimson on the copper kettle-drums
Then the tuckets , then the trumpets , then the cannon , and he comes

Don John laughing in the brave beard curled
Spurning of his stirrups like the thrones of all the world

Love-light of Spain - hurrah
Death-light of Africa

Mahound is in his paradise above the evening star
( Don John of Austria is going to the war

He moves a mighty turban on the timeless houri 's knees
His turban that is woven of the sunset and the seas

He shakes the peacock gardens as he rises from his ease
And he strides among the tree-tops and is taller than the trees

And his voice through all the garden is a thunder sent to bring
Black Azrael and Ariel and Ammon on the wing

Giants and the Genii
Multiplex of wing and eye

They rush in red and purple from the red clouds of the morn
From temples where the yellow gods shut up their eyes in scorn

They rise in green robes roaring from the green hells of the sea
Where fallen skies and evil hues and eyeless creatures be

On them the sea-valves cluster and the grey sea-forests curl
Splashed with a splendid sickness , the sickness of the pearl

They swell in sapphire smoke out of the blue cracks of the ground
They gather and they wonder and give worship to Mahound

And he saith , `` Break up the mountains where the hermit-folk may hide
And sift the red and silver sands lest bone of saint abide

And chase the Giaours flying night and day , not giving rest
For that which was our trouble comes again out of the west

We have set the seal of Solomon on all things under sun
Of knowledge and of sorrow and endurance of things done

But a noise is in the mountains , in the mountains , and I know
The voice that shook our palaces - four hundred years ago

It is he that saith not 'Kismet ' ; it is he that knows not Fate
It is Richard , it is Raymond , it is Godfrey in the gate

It is he whose loss is laughter when he counts the wager worth
Put down your feet upon him , that our peace be on the earth

For he heard drums groaning and he heard guns jar
( Don John of Austria is going to the war

Sudden and still - hurrah
Bolt from Iberia

St. Michael 's on his Mountain in the sea-roads of the north
( Don John of Austria is girt and going forth

Where the grey seas glitter and the sharp tides shift
And the sea-folk labour and the red sails lift

He shakes his lance of iron and he claps his wings of stone
The noise is gone through Normandy ; the noise is gone alone

The North is full of tangled things and texts and aching eyes
And dead is all the innocence of anger and surprise

And Christian killeth Christian in a narrow dusty room
And Christian dreadeth Christ that bath a newer face of doom

And Christian hateth Mary that God kissed in Galilee
But Don John of Austria is riding to the sea

Don John calling through the blast and the eclipse
Crying with the trumpet , with the trumpet of his lips

Trumpet that sayeth ha
Domino gloria

King Philip 's in his closet with the Fleece about his neck
( Don John of Austria is armed upon the deck

The walls are hung with velvet that is black and soft as sin
And little dwarfs creep out of it and little dwarfs creep in

He holds a crystal phial that has colours like the moon
He touches , and it tingles , and he trembles very soon

And his face is as a fungus of a leprous white and grey
Like plants in the high houses that are shuttered from the day

And death is in the phial and the end of noble work
But Don John of Austria has fired upon the Turk

Don John 's hunting , and his hounds have bayed
Booms away past Italy the rumour of his raid

Gun upon gun , ha ! ha
Gun upon gun , hurrah

The Pope was in his chapel before day or battle broke
( Don John of Austria is hidden in the smoke

The hidden room in a man 's house where God sits all the year
The secret window whence the world looks small and very dear

He sees as in a mirror on the monstrous twilight sea
The crescent of his cruel ships whose name is mystery

They fling great shadows foe-wards , making Cross and Castle dark
They veil the plumed lions on the galleys of St. Mark

And above the ships are palaces of brown , black-bearded chiefs
And below the ships are prisons , where with multitudinous griefs

Christian captives sick and sunless , all a labouring race repines
Like a race in sunken cities , like a nation in the mines

They are lost like slaves that swat , and in the skies of morning hung
The stairways of the tallest gods when tyranny was young

They are countless , voiceless , hopeless as those fallen or fleeing on
Before the high Kings ' horses in the granite of Babylon

And many a one grows witless in his quiet room in hell
Where a yellow face looks inward through the lattice of his cell

And he finds his God forgotten , and he seeks no more a sign
( But Don John of Austria has burst the battle-line

Don John pounding from the slaughter-painted poop
Purpling all the ocean like a bloody pirate 's sloop

Scarlet running over on the silvers and the golds
Breaking of the hatches up and bursting of the holds

Thronging of the thousands up that labour under sea
White for bliss and blind for sun and stunned for liberty

Vivat Hispania
Domino Gloria

Then while thro ' drouth all dumb they stood
I bit my arm and suck 'd the blood

Gramercy ! they for joy did grin
And all at once their breath drew in

Jet-black and bare , save where with rust
Of mouldy damps and charnel crust

Her skin is as white as leprosy
And she is far liker Death than he

While clombe above the Eastern bar
The horned Moon , with one bright Star

For the sky and the sea , and the sea and the sky
Lay like a load on my weary eye

But where the ship 's huge shadow lay
The charmed water burnt alway

They mov 'd in tracks of shining white
And when they rear 'd , the elfish light

Blue , glossy green , and velvet black
They coil 'd and swam ; and every track

To Mary-queen the praise be yeven
She sent the gentle sleep from heaven

To and fro they are hurried about
And to and fro , and in and out

Like waters shot from some high crag
The lightning falls with never a jag

Sometimes all little birds that are
How they seem 'd to fill the sea and air

But ere my living life returned
I heard and in my soul discerned

How loudly his sweet voice he rears
He loves to talk with Marineres

`` When the Ivy-tod is heavy with snow
`` And the Owlet whoops to the wolf below

The moment that his face I see
I know the man that must hear me

While each to his great father bends
Old men , and babes , and loving friends

Where Alph , the sacred river , ran
Through caverns measureless to man

So twice five miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were girdled round

Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover
A savage place ! as holy and enchanted

And from this chasm , with ceaseless turmoil seething
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing

A mighty fountain momently was forced
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst

Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flail

And Ã¢â‚¬â„¢mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
It flung up momently the sacred river

Through wood and dale the sacred river ran
Then reached the caverns measureless to man

And Ã¢â‚¬â„¢mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
Ancestral voices prophesying war

It was a miracle of rare device
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice

A damsel with a dulcimer
In a vision once I saw

It was an Abyssinian maid
And on her dulcimer she played

That sunny dome ! those caves of ice
And all who heard should see them there

Weave a circle round him thrice
And close your eyes with holy dread

Love moveth all things . You that love , shall move
All things in him , and he in you shall love

My love complains of others than of thee
Yet thee alone I loved , and they by me

Thou yet unknown , only mistaken were
Like him which feels a heat now here now there

Blames now this cause now that , until he see
The fire indeed from whence they caused be

Banished by over-weening wit from my desire
This poor acceptance only I require

That though my fault have forced me from thy sight
Yet that thou would'st , my sorrows to requite

Review these sonnets , pictures of thy praise
Wherein each woe thy wondrous worth doth raise

But joy in this , though fate 'gainst me repine
My verse still lives to witness thee divine

I do no favour crave ; but , humble wise
To thee my sighs in verse I sacrifice

Only some pity and no help to gain
Hear then , and as my heart shall aye remain

A patient object to thy lightning eyes
A patient ear bring thou to thund'ring cries

The voice is made the ear for to rejoice
And your ear giveth pleasure to my voice

Sith thou art cause that it this flight begun
For earthly vapours drawn up by the sun

Comets become , and night suns in the sky
Mine humble heart , so with thy heavenly eye

Drawn up aloft , all low desires doth shun
Raise thou me up , as thou my heart hast done

Thine eye a fire , and so draws up my love
My love a fire , and so ascends above

Take heed , do not so near his rays aspire
Lest , for thy pride , inflamed with wreakful ire

It burn thy wings , as it hath burned me
Thou haply sayst thy wings immortal be

And so can not consumed be with fire
And one is hope , the other is desire

Of heavenly eye though thou begotten art
Yet art thou born but of a mortal heart

Hoping by killing hope my love to stay
`` Let not , '' quoth he , `` thy hope , thy heart betray

Impossible it is her heart to move
But sith resolved love can not remove

As long as thy divine perfections stay
Thy godhead then he sought to take away

So shall thy foe give to himself the lie
A goddess thou shall prove , and happy I

Mine eye the window through the which thine eye
May see my heart , and there thyself espy

In bloody colours how thou painted art
Thine eye the pile is of a murdering dart

Mine eye the sight thou tak'st thy level by
To hit my heart , and never shoot'st awry

Or that the fires kindled by thine eye
The flowing streams of mine eyes could make dry

First _proud_ , sith it presumed to look so high
A watchman being made , stood gazing by

And _idle_ , took no heed till I was caught
And _envious_ , bears envy that by thought

Should in his absence be to her so nigh
To kill my heart , mine eye let in her eye

These sins procured have a goddess ' ire
Wherefore my heart is damned in love 's sweet fire

My tongue , my pen , my heart of flattery
Because I said there was no sun but thee

It called my tongue the partial trump of fame
And saith my pen hath flattered thy name

Because my pen did to my tongue agree
And that my heart must needs a flatterer be

Witness mine eyes , I say the truth in this
They have seen thee and know that so it is

More my despair to love a hopeless bliss
My folly most to love whom sure to miss

O help me , but this last grief to remove
All pains , if you command , it joy shall prove

And wisdom to seek joy . Then say but this
`` Because my pleasure in thy torment is

It was your will , and not my want of wit
I have the pain , bear you the blame of it

Because to see her lips they blush with shame
The lily 's leaves for envy pale became

And her white hands in them this envy bred
The marigold the leaves abroad doth spread

Because the sun 's and her power is the same
The violet of purple colour came

The rain wherewith she watereth the flowers
Falls from mine eyes which she dissolves in showers

To wit , most fair , most rich , most glittering
So when those three concur within one thing

Needs must that thing of honour be a note
Lately I did behold a rich fair coat

Which wished fortune to mine eyes did bring
A lordly coat , yet worthy of a king

And rich it was as by the gold appeareth
But happy he that in his arms it weareth

Dumb wonder only might speak of my joy
But too much worth hath made thee too much coy

And told me long ago I sighed in vain
Not then vain hope of undeserved gain

Hath made me paint in verses mine annoy
But for thy pleasure , that thou might'st enjoy

Although he shoots at me , but thinks it fit
Thus to bewitch thee for thy benefit

Causing thy will to my wish to condescend
For witches which some murder do intend

Do make a picture and do shoot at it
And in that part where they the picture hit

So love , too weak by force thy heart to taint
Within my heart thy heavenly shape doth paint

Taketh his lodging up in Thetis ' bed
Though from our eyes his beams be banished

Yet with his light th ' antipodes be blest
Now when the sun-time brings my sun to rest

Which me too oft of rest hath hindered
And whiter skin with white sheet covered

Of favour , not of due , I favour crave
Nature to thee beauty and favour gave

Fair then thou art , and favour thou may'st spare
Nor when on me bestowed your favours are

Less favour in your face you shall not have
If favour then a wounded soul may save

For by your favour only I do live
And favour you may well both keep and give

To watch and ward and such foes to descry
As they should ne'er my heart approaching spy

But traitor eyes my heart 's death did conspire
Corrupted with hope 's gifts ; let in desire

To burn my heart ; and sought no remedy
Though store of water were in either eye

In whom all beauty 's treasure we may find
That may unrich the body and the mind

Towards the poor should use no charity
My love has gone a begging unto thee

And if that beauty had not been more kind
That pity , long ere this he had been pined

A beggar starved for want of help he lies
And at your mouth , the door of beauty , cries

That thence some alms of sweet grants might proceed
But as he waiteth for some almes deed

A cherry tree before the door he spies
`` O dear , '' quoth he , `` two cherries may suffice

For only the sweet fruit of this sweet tree
Can give food to my love and life to me

The net , where caught the silly bird should be
Lest he the threatening poison should but see

And so for fear be forced to fly away
My lady so , the while she doth assay

In curled knots fast to entangle me
Put on her veil , to th ' end I should not flee

What needs such art my thoughts then to entrap
When of themselves they fly into your lap

From whence at me five ivory arrows fly
So with five wounds at once I wounded lie

Bearing my breast the print of every dart
Saint Francis had the like , yet felt no smart

Where I in living torments never die
His wounds were in his hands and feet ; where I

And some thy glove kiss as a thing divine
This arrows ' quiver , and this relic 's shrine

When night approacheth wherefore do you fly
Time is so short , beauties so many be

As I have need to see them day and night
That by continual view my verses might

Tell all the beams of your divinity
Which praise to you and joy should be to me

I by your sight , and not you by my verse
Need mortal skill immortal praise rehearse

But dost presume my dearest to molest
And without leave dar'st enter in that breast

Whereto sweet love approach yet never dared
Spare thou her health , which my life hath not spared

Too bitter such revenge of my unrest
Although with wrongs my thought she hath opprest

Whose babbling lost what else I might enjoy
When first mine eyes did with thy beauty joy

Whate'er he knew , did to my tongue unfold
My tell-tale tongue , in talking over bold

What in thy praise he spoke , that didst thou trust
And yet my sorrows thou dost hold unjust

Let others boast of choosing for the best
'T is substances not names must make us blest

In vain my wit doth tell in verse my woe
Despair in me , disdain in thee , doth show

How by my wit I do my folly prove
All this my heart from love can never move

Love is not in my heart . No , Lady , no
My heart is love itself . Till I forego

For as my heart is love , love not in me
So beauty thou , beauty is not in thee

Obedient subjects at thy beauty 's call
So many hearts bound in thy hairs as thrall

So many eyes die with one look 's disdain
Go , seek the honour that doth thee pertain

That the Fifth Monarchy may thee befall
Thou hast such means to conquer men withal

They say among themselves , `` O happy we
Whichever shall so rare an object see

But happy heart , if thoughts less happy were
For their delights have cost my heart full dear

In whom of love a thousand causes be
And each cause breeds a thousand loves in me

But hurl not love ; thou canst not , feeble heart
In thine own blood , thou therefore drowned art

Iron hath been transformed to gold by art
Her face , limbs , flesh and all , gold ; save her heart

Doubtful delay is worse than any fever
Or help me soon , or cast me off for ever

That is , new deaths . No marvel then , though I
Make exile my last help ; to th'end mine eye

Should not behold the death to me assigned
Not that from death absence might save my mind

But that it might take death more patiently
Like him , the which by judge condemned to die

Was ' Caesar 's tomb ; on which , with cunning hand
Jove 's triple honours , the three fair Graces , stand

Telling his virtues in their virtues true
This Rome admired ; but dearest dear , in you

Dwelleth the wonder of the happiest land
And all the world to Neptune 's furthest strand

That of my death I dare not thee accuse
But pride in me that baser chance refuse

Dost thou adjudge my luckless eyes and heart
The one to live exiled from that sweet smart

Where th ' other pines , imprisoned without date
My luckless eyes must never more debate

Of those bright beams that eased my love apart
And yet my heart , bound to them with love 's dart

But since these cross effects hath fortune wrought
Dwell , heart , with her ; eyes , view her in my thought

Iron with wearing shines ; rust wasteth treasure
On earth but love there is no other pleasure

Long have I served ; no short blaze is my love
Hid joys there are that maids scorn till they prove

Fired , feared , frantic , fettered , shot through , slain
My death is such as I may not complain

When all streams else help quench my burning heart
Shuts up her springs and will no grace impart

For lo , mine heart , resolved to moistening air
Feedeth mine eyes which double tear for tear

How fair he was by such attractive love
So if thou would'st thyself thy beauty prove

Vulgar breath-mirrors might have well contented
And to their prayers eternally consented

Oaths , vows and sighs , if they believe might move
But more thou forc'st , making my pen approve

Lo thus each sense , dear fair one , I importune
But being care , thou flyest me as ill fortune

This care am I ; this care my life hath taken
Dear to my soul , then leave me not forsaken

Sighing , `` Alas , what shall become of me
Whilst echo cries , `` What shall become of me

Which tears maintain as oil the lamp revives
Only my succour in thy favour lies

One moon dissolves my stormy night of woes
One star my fate and happy fortune shows

One saint I serve , one shrine with vows I dight
One sun transfix 'd hath burnt my heart outright

One moon opposed my love in darkness throws
One star hath bid my thoughts my wrongs disclose

My sun , my moon , my star , my saint , my shrine
Mine be the torment but the guilt be thine

If this be love , if love in these be founded
My heart is love , for these in it are grounded

That with the carver I my work do blame
Finding it still th ' augmenter of my flame

Pardon me then , divine , to love thee well
Since thou art heaven , and I in heaven would dwell

Till reason told them there was no such power
And bade me view fair beauty 's richest flower

To see if there a naked boy remained
Dear , to thine eyes , eyes that my soul hath pained

Thoughts turned them back in that unhappy hour
To see if love kept there his royal bower

Then with a sigh , reason made thoughts to cry
`` There is no god of love , save that thine eye

Sure 't is thyself that shows my love distrest
For fire exhaled in freezing clouds possessed

Warring for way , makes all the heavens exclaim
Thy beauty so , the brightest living flame

Wrapt in my cloudy heart , by winter prest
Scorning to dwell within so base a nest

For as the fire through freezing clouds doth break
So not myself but thou in me would'st speak

Save that my love still holdeth him in hand
A kingdom thus divided can not stand

When first proud love , my joys away adjourning
Poured into mine eye to her eye turning

A deadly juice , unto my green thought 's reason
Prisoner I am unto the eye I gaze on

Eternally my love 's flame is in burning
A mortal shaft still wounds me in my mourning

In my despair are evermore increasing
The more I love , less is my pain 's releasing

The hour , the month , the season , and the cause
When love first made me thrall to lovers ' laws

And sighed I have in vain to sweet what smarteth
But from his brow a fiery arrow parteth

Thinking that I should him resist not plaining
But cowardly my heart submiss remaining

Yields to receive what shaft thy fair eye darteth
Well do I see thine eye my bale imparteth

One in his bed consumes his life away
Other in wars , another in the sea

For heavens avowed my fortune should be such
That I should die by loving far too much

Whose virtues rare , unto the heavens arise
My God , my God , how much I love her eyes

Whose works may ravish heaven 's richest maker
Of whose eyes ' joys if I might be partaker

Whose hands I kiss and ravished oft rekisseth
When she stands wotless whom so much she blesseth

Since her perfections pure , withouten blot
Makes her beloved of thee , she knoweth not

As from the first thy sex exiled me
So to this next let me be called by thee

Thou Paradise , thou only heaven I know
What influence hath bred my hateful woe

That I from thee and them am forced to fall
Thou falled from me , from thee I never shall

Although my fortunes thou hast brought so low
Yet shall my faith and service with thee go

Cursing my stars ; albeit I find it true
I lost all these when I lost love and you

Love in his glory ? No , him Thyrsis saw
And stood the boy , whilst he his darts did draw

Whose painted pride to baser swains he telled
Saw I two suns ? That sight is seen but seld

Yet can their brood that teach the holy law
Gaze on their beams , and dread them not a straw

Yet did I gaze ; and thereby caught the wound
Which burns my heart and keeps my body sound

That ne'er had her disdain made me despair
Had she not been so excellently fair

But that which grieves me most is that I see
Those which most fair , the most unkindest be

Such grief is not the tenour of my song
That 'bide so zealously so bad a wrong

My grief is this ; unless I speak and plain me
Thou wilt persever ever to disdain me

How little pitiful and how much unkind
They other not so worthy beauties find

O , I not so ! but seek with humble prayer
Means how to move th ' unmercifullest fair

O if there 's none but thou can work my woe
Wilt thou be still unkind and kill me so

O since the world knows what the power can do
What were't for thee to save and love me too

But those that love well have not yet begun
Persever ever and have never done

For some can say , whose loves have known like passion
`` Women are kind by kind , and coy for fashion

For if I die and thou repent t ' have slain me
'Twill grieve me more than if thou didst disdain me

I do not grieve that I am forced to die
But die to think upon the reason why

That she though coy may yet survive to see
Her beauty 's wonder lives again in me

No more shall pen with love and beauty mell
But to my heart alone my heart shall tell

How unseen flames do burn it day and night
Lest flames give light , light bring my love to sight

And my love prove my folly to excel
Wherefore my love burns like the fire of hell

Skill-less blames he the thing he doth not know
And he that so hath loved should favour show

Thus shall henceforth more pain , more folly have
And folly past , may justly pardon crave

Both in the wondrous year and on the day
Wherein the fairest planet beareth sway

The heavens to thee this fortune doth decree
Thou of a world of hearts in time shall be

A monarch great , and with one beauty 's ray
So many hosts of hearts thy face shall slay

His father 's conquests wept , lest he should leave
No kingdom unto him for to subdue

So many hearts already she hath slain
As few behind to conquer shall remain

As light and glittering weapons babes allure
To play with fire and sword , and so procure

Then to be burnt and hurt ere they take heed
Thy beauty so hath made me burn and bleed

Yet shall my ashes and my blood assure
Thy beauty 's fame forever to endure

Life to thy fame , thou right a phoenix art
And like a pelican thy beauty liveth

Lo why with wonder we may thee compare
Unto the pelican and phoenix rare

Come see , come see , and write what wonder you do see
Causing by true report our next posterity

Curse fortune for that they were born too late
Come then and come ye all , come soon lest that

The time should be too short and men too few should be
For all be few to write her least part 's history

Millions speak of her , millions write of her hand
The whole eye on the lip I do not understand

As either of her eye or lip or hand to write
The light or black , the taste or red , the soft or white

For which to heaven earth doth no envy bear
Seeing and hearing thee , we see and hear

Such voice , such light , as never sung nor shone
The want of heaven I grant yet we may moan

Not for the pleasure of the angels there
As though in face or voice they like thee were

The basest notes which from thy voice proceed
The treble of the angels do exceed

Thy lips sweet roses , breast sweet lily is
That love esteems these three the chiefest bliss

Which nature ever made for lips ' delight
But when these three to show their heavenly might

Such wonders do , devotion then for this
Commandeth us with humble zeal to kiss

To show the one whose other there is not
The whitest skins red blushing shame doth blot

And in the reddest cheeks pale envy is
The fair and foul come thus alike by this

For when the sun hath our horizon got
Venus herself doth shine no more , God wot

For unto God is only due this praise
The highest to pluck down , the low to raise

That former poets praise the beauty of their days
But all those beauties were but figures of thy praise

And all those poets did of thee but prophesy
Thy coming to the world hath taught us to descry

What Petrarch 's Laura meant , for truth the lip bewrays
Lo , why th ' Italians , yet which never saw thy rays

In one day now then I did in a year
Great flames they be which but small sparkles were

And wounded now , I was but pricked before
No marvel then , though more than heretofore

I weep and sigh ; how can great wounds be there
Where moisture runs not out ? and ever , where

And of that comfort do myself bereave
Which both I did deserve and did receive

Triumph not over much in this my smart
Nay , rather they which now enjoy thy heart

For fear just cause of mourning should conceive
Lest thou inconstant shouldst their trust deceive

Of unrequited service , it is I
Change is the thanks I have for loyalty

And only her reward is her disdain
So as just spite did almost me constrain

Through torment her due praises to deny
For he which vexed is with injury

But what , shall torture make me wrong her name
No , no , a pris'ner constant thinks it shame

The sweetest singer falters in his scale
Eagle , and Lark , and Swan , and Nightingale

So will the gossips ask themselves when Fame
Shall set her impudent lips upon my name

And make an auction for your cast-off glove
They know you not . You are a brooding dove

Whose spirit , fearful of the world 's sharp flame
Nestles unto the goodness whence it came

You are to sit before your jewelled glass
Beautiful as the Garden of the Lord

Young Spring has spilt her magic on the wold
The woodlands ring with rapture as of old

And England lies new-washen , green and fair
Yet is she heavy with a secret care

For Death the ever-sharp and over-bold
Hath taken our Tongue of Honey , our Throat of Gold

And the long doubt and the disputed throne
And the contempts which turn the heart to stone

Who that hath wit shall breathe you a regret
Who that hath tears shall pay you pity 's debt

Unto your place of easing you are gone
Having fetched for us Beauty from her own

Upon the English orchards pink and white
And over them the rapture and delight

Of April sunshine ! Fair and fresh and clean
Washen as if in wells of hyaline

And very wondrous to the pilgrim sight
A glad , new land of all things soft and bright

Whose blood but now shone like a living rose
Dropped by the Lord upon the Flanders snows

Tumours and hearts and dropsies , there we lay
Weary of night and wearier of day

With no more health in us than rotten sheep
Then , tossed to us on some intangible deep

Alicia came , and each man learnt to pray
That Providence would please find out a way

Which swing and tumble south in ghostly white
Behemoth rushes blindly from the night

Behemoth whom we have praised on instruments
Dulcet and shrill and impudent with vents

Behemoth whose huge body was our delight
And miracle , wallows where there is no light

The English lark sings in the August weather
For joy which knoweth neither tie nor tether

And is not troubled if the world grows old
While you , who were as blithesome and as bold

And held your life lightly as any feather
Sleep the high sleep that dead men sleep together

Their house of joy no further brightness shows
Their loveliness is come unto its close

Their last touch given , and their last kindness said
For him no more the vision of her bent head

For her no more the lily or the rose
Nor any gladness in this place of woes

One who is plumed and powerful breaks us down
Marred are the orchards , shaken our strong town

And blackness covers up our bright array
The Sceptre and the Orb are put away

The scarlet changed for the funereal gown
And easy lies the head that wore a Crown

Through which I toil , hurt and uncomforted
You see on what base errands I am sped

And what I reap where we sowed asphodel
And my songs are of sorrow , and I tell

Knowing no other , tales of grief and dread
Though I be warm I am as good as dead

Cherish their offsprings in the solitude
And red-eyed tigresses whose trade is blood

And female panthers , and jackals in their lairs
The lowliest , sullenest mother-creature wears

In her hot heart a jewel of motherhood
And knoweth darkly that the only good

O great-thewed mother of us all , behold
How this thy sturdy child , who is foully sold

The April dawn glimmers along the beds
There is a lifting up of weary heads

From weary pillows . Our old citadel
Hath still held out , and while the miracle

Of morning is unbared again , and spreads
All the young East with greens and blues and reds

For he has torn you ultimately from your place
And shattered all the woman in your face

And put his last injunction on your breath
And ferried you across to his dim staith

Where there is none who hath either hope or grace
But only the unimaginable race

Dumbly into the bitter fields alone
For you have long since made your widow 's moan

And carried in your heart the widow 's woe
Outrageous Death hath neither feint nor blow

To hurt you further . Thus without a groan
I shall go down , and be as cold as stone

With Fate and Death and the illicit Beast
For guerdons , of which Glory is the least

And Honour not the highest . The old reign
Of Night shall topple , the old Wrongs be slain

Fitting it is that you go to the Feast
While angel suns kindle the young-eyed east

You gave us freely what you valued most
It is not loss , for gifts are never lost

Unto the giver . Lo , the star-kept , dim
Limits where battle fades away , and grim

Death halts and hath no power ! On that coast
His feet are set among the shining host

For ever on the firmament of Time
Like lovely words caught in a lovely rhyme

Or silver stars kept in a faery net
Ivory and marble hold them for us yet

And all our blossomy memories of them chime
With all the honest graces of the prime

Let us contemn , disparage , and cry down
These prancing stomachs who amass and own

Inherit and squander , and have nets and chains
And panoplies of penalties and pains

Wherewith to extort the uttermost half-crown
For whom indeed the world 's hard fields are sown

Upon a garden wherein sleeps a rose
Who hath a ruby heart ; beside her glows

Unblemished , in a drifted , vestal gown
Yon lily , and beyond them lies a town

Of tufted green and each sweet bloom that blows
Midmost from whence a little fountain throws

Brown eyes and freckles and a cheerful grin
She saunters up the ward , and stricken sin

Nods and looks pleasant ( why should one repine
She takes `` her cases , '' looks for every `` sign

Hammers and sounds the portly and the thin
Plies them with questions till their cheap heads spin

Out of its grubbing to throw greasy pence
Forth to the hat , and choke with eloquence

In boastful prose and verse of doubtful staves
Four men have died , gentlemen , heroes , braves

Snows wrap them round eternally . From thence
They may no more return to life or sense

The drunken drone of twenty-two brass bands
A flip-flap , and some hokey-pokey stands

Smith on your left , and Lipton on your right
And Lyons , Lyons , Lyons ; and that bright

Particular marvel , which , be sure , commands
Respect from fools of all and sundry brands

In Tyre , in Ilium , and in Babylon
Which smote the welkin many a year agone

With torches and with shouting . Whoso sleeps
On the large hills , or drowns in the old deeps

His name shines in a book for thee to con
And thy chill pomps and aching triumphs are won

She is become a ruinous , delicate wraith
And now she gives her perfumes up to Death

No longer may she shine in the sweet light
Or drink the dewey darkness ; for the might

That breaks the hearts of kings and staggereth
Bold men , hath borne her down . `` Take me , '' she saith

Give me the tongue of wonder and the pen
Of magic which doth fetch the souls of men

Out of deep hell ; give me the stings of scorn
The rage of blood , agony of the thorn

Wisdom of hills and stars . Let me be ten
Times tried in furnaces , and tried again

Four pomegranates grow for me
On my true love 's silver tree

One I have tasted , and my mouth
Is filled with fragrance of the South

One , which burns with holy red
He shall give me when we wed

The third from its branch shall be torn
When our little son is born

The fourth , which is most delicate
Kinder than Love , sharper than Fate

Fairer than fruit of Samarkand
You shall put in my dead hand

O secret , consecrate
Inviolable spirit , elate

And amorous and proud
With blanchÃƒÂ¨d plumes that shroud

And glitteringly conceal
The flame , and the vermeil

Who to this garden of tears
And the enthronÃƒÂ¨d spheres

Who blessest for the blest
And for the lowliest

And standest on heaven 's rim
Out-staturing seraphim

And sittest by poor men 's fires
And givest to the wicked their desires

And whom to gaze upon
That which is done is done

For ever , and shall be
Unto eternity

In the translated clay
Bathed out of Paphia

In love and laughter and might
And the seven souls of right

And seventy souls of wrong
In birth and sorrow and song

And terror and despair
And all things fine and fair

Whether of gold or green
The wonder have I seen

The immanence flashing by
And , slain with it , I die

`` Now Good , '' quoth he
`` Be good for me

O simple wight
As well he might

Who , when all 's said
Is a gentleman bred

He trudgeth forth
Now south now north

Upon his back
He bears a pack

And mile on mile
With an equal smile

`` Yea these , '' he sware
`` Be God 's own pair

In smocks they go
To milk and mow

But if your due
Be twelve , for you

Yet Dick , fell wretch
Did the hangman stretch

And by the Bench
That brazen wench

That folk might cry
`` In villainy

`` Still Good , '' quoth he
`` Be good for me

My grandam dear
Above her beer

` O little lad
Eschew the bad

Upon an ass
He is fain to pass

And soon doth stop
With my lord bishop

( `` So honest a face
Mused his lordship 's grace

Here every saw
Of the moral law

Till on a night
In the candle-light

And they played a game
Bezique by name

So , nothing loth
Our friend shogged off

Whom fools did rate
For a prop of the State

For by wink or grin
He approved the sin

Then a judge he served
Who quite unnerved

Such as bringing home quills
From the Office of Wills

And , once a week
Pinching the cheek

`` Still Good for me
Be good , '' quoth he

I will show my mind
Unto mankind

And tell them how
All men I know

He trudgeth forth
Both south and north

And saith aloud
To the wondering crowd

And liars and cheats
And hypocrites

He was the first
That ever burst

Eftsoons they cried
`` This fellow 's pride

And with grievous stones
They bruised his bones

Upon the floor
He lies full sore

Although he must
Give up the ghost

With his last breath
He uttereth

So passeth he
Most miserably

Unhappy wight
As well he might

Who on the whole
Is a decent soul

In the dusks of delight
And the noons of the night

On his sword and his crest
And his hands on his breast

Which thou from out thy greatness dost inspire
Since only thou has deigned to raise them higher

Wherein my zeal and thy great might is shown
And seeing this unto the world is known

Whereof the travail I may challenge mine
But yet the glory , Madam , must be thine

Read it , sweet maid , though it be done but slightly
Who can show all his love , doth love but lightly

Knock at her hard heart , beg till you have moved her
And tell th'unkind how dearly I have loved her

That she hath done , the motive of my pain
Who whilst I love doth kill me with disdain

These lines I use t'unburden mine own heart
My love affects no fame nor 'steems of art

Those that I fostered of mine own accord
Are made by her to murder thus their lord

O had she not been fair and thus unkind
My Muse had slept and none had known my mind

For being full , should I not then have spoken
My sense oppressed had failed and heart had broken

Yet though I see that nought we do can move
'T is not disdain must make me cease to love

If this be love , to live a living death
Then do I love , and draw this weary breath

Once let her know sh'hath done enough to prove me
And let her pity if she can not love me

Yet will I weep , vow , pray to cruel she
Flint , frost , disdain , wears , melts and yields , we see

All my life 's sweet consists in her alone
So much I love the most unloving one

O happy he that joyed his stone and art
Unhappy I , to love a stony heart

Yet lest long travails be above my strength
Good Delia , loose , quench , heal me , now at length

Let this suffice , that all the world may see
The fault is hers , though mine the hurt must be

This is my state , my griefs do touch so nearly
And thus I live because I love her dearly

Favours , I think , would sense quite overcome
And that makes happy lovers ever dumb

Oft have I told her that my soul did love her
And that with tears ; yet all this will not move her

Yield to the marble thy hard heart again
So shalt thou cease to plague , and I to pain

This cruel knowledge of these contraries
Delia , my heart hath learned out of those eyes

Yet sure she can not but must think apart
She doth me wrong to grieve so true a heart

Let her not still triumph over the prize
Of mine affections taken by her eyes

Yet spare her , Time ; let her exempted be
She may become more kind to thee or me

Thus she returns my hopes so fruitless ever
Once let her love indeed , or eye me never

Looks feed my hope , hope fosters me in vain
Hopes are unsure when certain is my pain

Whilst we both make the world admire at us
Her for disdain , and me for loving thus

What can I do but yield ? and yield I do
And serve all three , and yet they spoil me too

Then there I die from whence my life should come
And by that hand whom such deeds ill become

See then who sins the greater of us twain
I in my love , or thou in thy disdain

Stars , then , not eyes , move you with milder view
Your sweet aspect on him that honours you

Which still must bear the title of my wrong
Caused by those cruel beams that were so strong

And therefore , Delia , 't is to me no blot
To have attempted though attained thee not

Thinking to scale the heaven of her heart
My slender means presumed too high a part

Her thunder of disdain forced me retire
And threw me down to pain in all this fire

Where lo , I languish in so heavy smart
Because th'attempt was far above my art

Her sight , contented thus to see me spill
Framed my desires fit for her eyes to kill

And you are changed , but not t ' a hyacinth
I fear your eye hath turned your heart to flint

And golden hairs shall change to silver wire
And those bright rays that kindle all this fire

Shall fail in force , their working not so strong
Then beauty , now the burden of my song

Whose glorious blaze the world doth so admire
Must yield up all to tyrant Time 's desire

Then do not thou such treasure waste in vain
But love now whilst thou mayst be loved again

Men do not weigh the stalk for that it was
When once they find her flower , her glory pass

Thou mayst repent that thou hast scorned my tears
When winter snows upon thy sable hairs

If they remain , then thou shalt live thereby
They will remain , and so thou canst not die

For though that Laura better limned be
Suffice , thou shalt be loved as well as she

Although my careful accents never moved thee
Yet count it no disgrace that I loved thee

That grace which doth more than inwoman thee
Lives in my lines and must eternal be

Once let the ocean of my care find shore
That thou be pleased , and I may sigh no more

Thus ruins she to satisfy her will
The temple where her name was honoured still

And if I find such pleasure to complain
What should I do then if I should obtain

I know her heart can not but judge with me
Although her eyes my adversaries be

But ah ! no more , this must not be foretold
For women grieve to think they must be old

Make me to say , when all my griefs are gone
Happy the heart that sighed for such a one

But yet what comforts shall I hereby gain
Bearing the wound , I needs must feel the pain

Still let disarmed peace deck her and thee
And Muse-foe Mars abroad far fostered be

Still let me sleep , embracing clouds in vain
And never wake to feel the day 's disdain

Though th'error of my youth in them appear
Suffice , they show I lived and loved thee , dear

Yet happy Delia that thou wast unkind
Though happier far , if thou would'st change thy mind

For no ground else could make the music such
Nor other hand could give so sweet a touch

Avon shall be my Thames , and she my song
No other prouder brooks shall hear my wrong

What though my Muse no honour get thereby
Each bird sings to herself , and so will I

This is my state , and Delia 's heart is such
I say no more , I fear I said too much

The price of your efteeme t ' a . lower rate
Then doth befit the pitch of your eftate

And none we fee were euer ouerthrowne
By others flattery more then by their owne

Since nothing cheeres the heart of greatnelfe more
Then th'Anceftors faire glory gone before

Into the golden Metall of the Minde
Who thus obferues in fuch materiall kinde

Turne in their courfe , and fees their fatalnes . __
And hee that can make thefe obferuances

Whofe Work , improu 'd here to our greater gaine
Makes C/esar more then C/esar to containe

My muse is rightly of the English strain
That can not long one fashion entertain

Thus in my love , time calls me to relate
My tedious travels and oft-varying fate

By this I see , however things be past
Yet heaven will still have murder out at last

And all is thine which hath been due to me
And I a bankrupt , quite undone by thee

Let what I praise be still made good by you
Be you most worthy whilst I am most true

Let `` No ! '' and `` I ! '' with I and you be so
Then answer `` No ! '' and `` I ! '' and `` I ! '' and `` No

So shalt thou fly above the vulgar throng
Still to survive in my immortal song

A gentle warning , friends , thus may you see
What 't is to keep a drunkard company

These lines that now thou scornst , which should delight thee
Then would I make thee read but to despite thee

With diet and correction men distraught
Not too far past , may to their wits be brought

Only that little which to me was lent
I give thee back when all the rest is spent

You do bewitch me ! O that I could fly
From my self you , or from your own self I

The soul of man immortal and divine
And doth the several offices define

_Animus._ Moving a will in us , it is the mind
_Mens._ Retaining knowledge , still the same in kind

_Sensus._ In speedy apprehension , it is sense
_Conscientia._ In right and wrong they call her conscience

These of the soul the several functions be
Which my heart lightened by thy love doth see

Metals do waste and fret with canker 's rust
The diamond shall once consume to dust

To write with blood of force offends the sight
And if with tears , I find them all too light

Which still shalt be as long as there is sun
Nor whilst the world is never shall be done

That everything whence shadow doth proceed
May in his shadow my love 's story read

Condemned by Jove to endless torment be
I greatly marvel how you still go free

Which from above he craftily did take
Of lifeless clods us living men to make

Where virtue , honour , wit , and beauty lay
Which taking thence , you have escaped away

Yet old Prometheus punished for his rape
Thus poor thieves suffer when the greater 'scape

If this receipt have not the power to win me
Little I 'll say , but think the devil 's in me

Of the birds ' kind , the phoenix is alone
Which best by you of living things is known

The precious spices be your chaste desire
Which being kindled by that heavenly fire

With so rare sweetness all the heavens perfuming
Again increasing as you are consuming

And winged by fame you to the stars ascend
So you of time shall live beyond the end

From age to age , what thou hast sought to see
One in whom all the excellencies be

And thy youth past in this pure mirror see
As the world 's beauty in his infancy

Yet see thou tell but truly what hath been
Say to our nephews that thou once hast seen

And bid them mourn , nay more , despair with thee
That she is gone , her like again to see

Three nines there are , to every one a nine
One number of the earth , the other both divine

Nine muses do with learning still frequent
These with the gods are ever resident

And my fair Muse , one Muse unto the nine
And my good angel , in my soul divine

My Muse , my worthy , and my angel then
Makes every one of these three nines a ten

Your love and hate is this , I now do prove you
You love in hate , by hate to make me love you

Thus am I still provoked to every evil
By this good wicked spirit , sweet angel-devil

Yet by my troth , this fool his love obtains
And I lose you for all my wit and pains

Yet fools and children sometimes tell in play
Some wise in show , more fools indeed than they

Well , well , my friends , when beggars grow thus bold
No marvel then though charity grow cold

Where other men in depth of passion cry
I laugh at fortune , as in jest to die

And when my flowing numbers they rehearse
Let wolves and bears be charmed with my verse

Yet hope draws on my never-hoping care
And my life 's hope would die but for despair

Yet my hope 's wings are laden so with fear
As they can not ascend to my hope 's sphere

So my love is still fettered with vain hope
And liberty deprives him of his scope

Then , sweet despair , awhile hold up thy head
Or all my hope for sorrow will be dead

Or nature must be partial in my cause
Or only you do violate her laws

In everything I hold this maxim still
The circumstance doth make it good or ill

And thus by those of whom I hoped for aid
To cruel love my soul was first betrayed

Thou art my Vesta , thou my goddess art
Thy hallowed temple only is my heart

Up to my pitch no common judgment flies
I scorn all earthly dung-bred scarabies

Arden 's sweet Ankor , let thy glory be
That fair Idea only lives by thee

That since the one can not the other be
That eyes could think of that my heart could see

Ravished a world beyond the farthest thought
And knowing more than ever hath been taught

Aiming at things exceeding all perfection
To wisdom 's self to minister direction

Though my conceit I further seem to bend
Than possibly invention can extend

If thou wilt wonder , here 's the wonder , love
That this to me doth yet no wonder prove

When I do speak of miracles by thee
May say that thou art flattered by me

A dumb-born Muse made to express the mind
A cripple hand to write , yet lame by kind

And mine ears deaf by thy fame healed be
My vices cured by virtues sprung from thee

All unclean thoughts , foul spirits , cast out in me
Only by virtue that proceeds from thee

I conjure thee by all that I have named
To make her love , or , Cupid , be thou damned

Well could I wish it would be ever day
If when night comes , you bid me go away

Reason plucks back , commanding me to stay
Boasting that she doth still direct the way

And scorning reason 's maimed argument
Straight taxeth reason , wanting to invent

Despiteth love , and laugheth at her folly
And love contemning reason 's reason wholly

Reason put back doth out of sight remove
And love alone picks reason out of love

I pass not for Minerva , nor Astrea
Only I call on my divine Idea

With Sisyphus thus do I roll the stone
And turn the wheel with damned Ixion

Now I deny her , then I do confess her
Now do I curse her , then again I bless her

And much commend the strangeness of my vein
Some say I have a passing pleasing strain

They say , as poets do , I use to feign
And in bare words paint out by passions ' pain

Nor who commends or discommends my verse
It pleaseth me if I my woes rehearse

Only my comfort still consists in this
Writing her praise I can not write amiss

Only compelled on this poor good to boast
Heavens are not kind to them that know them most

And though this earthly body fade and die
My name shall mount upon eternity

Which with my plaint seem yet with pity moved
Kinder than she whom I so long have loved

But what of this ? Should she to death be led
It furthers justice but helps not the dead

No public glory vainly I pursue
All that I seek is to eternise you

That whilst with Mars she holdeth her old way
Thou , her blind son , mayst sit by them and play

Thou thus whose spirit love in his fire refines
Come thou and read , admire , applaud my lines

By curing me and killing me each hour
Only to show her beauty 's sovereign power

Though heaven and earth prove both to me untrue
Yet am I still inviolate to you

What talk I of a heart when thou hast none
Or if thou hast , it is a flinty one

Fair Arden , thou my Tempe art alone
And thou , sweet Ankor , art my Helicon

Which name my Muse to highest heavens shall raise
By chaste desire , true love , and virtuous praise

Those eyes to my heart shining ever bright
When darkness hath obscured each other light

Thus from my breast , where it was bred alone
It after thee is like an eaglet flown

Most of all short when I would show you most
In your perfections so much am I lost

Pity so left to th ' coldness of your blood
Not to avail you nor do others good

And having thus awhile each other thwarted
Fools as we met , so fools again we parted

And see if time , if he would strive to prove
Can show a second to so pure a love

Now if thou wouldst , when all have given him over
From death to life thou might'st him yet recover

I have , I want , despair , and yet desire
Burned in a sea of ice , and drowned amidst a fire

I send defiance , since if overthrown
Thou vanquishing , the conquest is mine own

My love 's school-mistress now hath taught me so
That I can read a story of my woe

Ã’Ah , fools , Ã“ think I , Ã’had you Idea seen
Poor brooks and banks had no such wonders been.Ã“

The God 's pure fire hath been extinguished quite
No virgin once attending on that light

Within the temple of thy sacred name
With thine eyes kindling that celestial flame

Attends that lamp with eye which never sleepeth
The volumes of religion 's laws she keepeth

Where blessed angels , singing day and night
Praise Him which made that fire which lends that light

Lo , where she drowns in storms of thy displeasure
Whose worthy prize should have enriched thy treasure

Though these nor these deserve to be embraced
Yet , fair unkind , too good to be disgraced

Whose pure idea never tongue exprest
I feel , you know , the heavens can tell , the rest

For thou alone renew'st that old desire
Which still torments me in day 's burning fire

So may he grace all these in her alone
Superlative in all comparison

And tell the world , that in the world there is
A heaven on earth , on earth no heaven but this

Like me that lust , my honest merry rhymes
Nor care for critic , nor regard the times

EYES , with your tears blind if you be
Why have these tears such eyes to see

Poor eyes , if your tears can not move
My tears , eyes , then must moan my love

Then , eyes , since you have lost your sight
Weep still , and tears shall lend you light

No , no , clear eyes , you are not blind
But in my tears discern my mind

Tears be the language which you speak
Which my heart wanting yet , must break

My tongue must cease to tell my wrongs
And make my sighs to get them tongues

And why not I , as hee
That 's greatest , if as free

I will , yea , and I may
Who shall oppose my way

APOLLO , and the Nine
Forbid no Man their Shrine

For they be such coy Things
That they care not for Kings

The _Phocean_ it did proue
Whom when foule Lust did moue

That instrument ne ' r heard
Strooke by the skilfull Bard

As those Prophetike strings
Whose sounds with fiery Wings

So his , which Women slue
And it int ' Hebrus threw

That by the Tortoyse shell
To MAYAS Sonne it fell

The Wildest of the field
And Ayre , with Riuers t ' yeeld

And diuersly though Strung
So anciently We sung

The _Druydes_ imbrewed
With Gore , on Altars rude

Though wee be All to seeke
Of PINDAR that Great _Greeke_

Or him that _Rome_ did grace
Whose Ayres we all imbrace

The _Irish_ I admire
And still cleaue to that Lyre

As _Britons_ , that so long
Haue held this Antike Song

_Southerne_ , I long thee spare
Yet wish thee well to fare

To those that with despight
Shall terme these Numbers slight

Nor is 't the Verse doth make
That giueth , or doth take

Rich Statue , double-faced
With Marble Temples graced

In flames where Altars shining
Before thy Priests diuining

Great IANVS , I thy pleasure
With all the _Thespian_ treasure

To th ' passed yeere returning
As though the old adiourning

Thy ancient Vigils yeerely
I haue obserued cleerely

Since all thy store abroad is
Giue something to my Goddesse

Giue her th ' _Eoan_ brightnesse
Wing 'd with that subtill lightnesse

The Roses of the Morning
The rising Heau'n adorning

Those ceaselesse Sounds , aboue all
Made by those Orbes that moue all

Wrap 'd vp in Numbers flowing
Them actually bestowing

O Rapture great and holy
Doe thou transport me wholly

That I aloft may beare her
Whereas I will insphere her

And in my choise Composures
The soft and easie Closures

That euery liuely Ceasure
Shall tread a perfect Measure

That Spray to fame so fertle
The Louer-crowning Mirtle

Within whose shades are dwelling
Those Beauties most excelling

Those Paralels so euen
Drawne on the face of Heauen

Direct those Gems , whose cleerenesse
Farre off amaze by neerenesse

Her Bosome full of Blisses
By Nature made for Kisses

Whereas a thousand Graces
Behold their louely Faces

O , thou selfe-little blindnesse
The kindnesse of vnkindnesse

Thy Brands to me were leuer
Thy _Fascia_ , and thy Quiuer

This Heart so freshly bleeding
Vpon it owne selfe feeding

O Loue , thy selfe confounding
Her coldnesse so abounding

Yet if I be inspired
Ile leaue thee so admired

That were they more then many
'Mongst all , there is not any

Nor Adamant ingraued
That hath been choisely 'st saued

So large a Dower as this is
The greatest often misses

Get vp , and let vs see
What Beautie it shall bee

As once that Thund'rer did
When he in drops lay hid

And pow'rfully trans-pierce
The Globie Vniuerse

O , thou bright Morning-Starre
'T is I that come so farre

So may we two be true
This yeere , nor change for new

They but by billing woo
Then try what we can doo

This Season vs doth fit
Then let vs follow it

With sweetnesse of thy breath
O smother me to death

Saint VALENTINE befriend
We thus this Morne may spend

If thus we needs must goe
What shall our one Heart doe

Madame , two Hearts we brake
And from them both did take

Halfe this is of your Heart
Mine in the other part

Were it cymented , or sowne
By Shreds or Pieces knowne

But 't is dissolu 'd , and fixed
And with such cunning mixed

But how shall we agree
By whom it kept shall be

It can not two Brests fill
One must be heartlesse still

It came to me one day
When I will 'd it to say

It told me , in your Brest
Where it might hope to rest

For certainety it knew
That I would still anew

Neuer , I thinke , had two
Such worke , so much to doo

Yours was so cold and chaste
Whilst mine with zeale did waste

How did my Heart intreat
How pant , how did it beat

Till to that temper brought
Through our perfection wrought

In such a Height it lyes
From this base Worlds dull Eyes

All that this Earth can show
Our Heart shall not once know

Priests of APOLLO , sacred be the Roome
For this learn 'd Meeting : Let no barbarous Groome

This for the _Delphian_ Prophets is prepared
The prophane Vulgar are from hence debared

And since the Feast so happily begins
Call vp those faire Nine , with their Violins

But let them neere to young APOLLO sit
So shall his Foot-pace ouer-flow with Wit

Where be the Graces , where be those fayre Three
In any hand they may not absent bee

They , and the Muses , rise both from one Stem
They grace the Muses , and the Muses them

Bring forth your Flaggons ( fill 'd with sparkling Wine
Whereon swolne BACCHVS , crowned with a Vine

Let not a Man drinke , but in Draughts profound
To our God PHOEBVS let the Health goe Round

Let your Iests flye at large ; yet therewithall
See they be Salt , but yet not mix 'd with Gall

That they with tickling Pleasure may prouoke
Laughter in him , on whom the Iest is broke

Or if the deeds of HEROES ye rehearse
Let them be sung in so well-ord'red Verse

That they may make the stiffest Storme seeme weake
And dampe IOVES Thunder , when it lowd'st doth speake

And if yee list to exercise your Vayne
Or in the Sock , or in the Buskin 'd Strayne

The thick-brayn 'd Audience liuely to awake
Till with shrill Claps the Theater doe shake

Sing Hymnes to BACCHVS then , with hands vpreared
Offer to IOVE , who most is to be feared

Them , whom the World would starue ; then let the Lyre
Sound , whilst his Altars endlesse flames expire

Maydens , why spare ye
Or whether not dare ye

Because wanton VENVS
So oft that doth paine vs

Now in the Spring
He proueth his Wing

And as the small Bee
About flyeth hee

And wantonly roues
Abroad in the Groues

Which when it him deweth
His Fethers he meweth

And since doom 'd by Fate
( That well knew his Hate

For very despite
Our Eyes be his White

If his Shafts loosing
( Ill his Mark choosing

The Moane VENVS maketh
And care that she taketh

To VULCAN commending
Her loue , and straight sending

With Kisses vnto him
And all but to woo him

Telling what he hath done
( Sayth she , Right mine owne Sonne

Sweetes on him fans
Layd in Downe of her Swans

And feeds him with Kisses
Which oft when he misses

The Mothers o ' r-ioying
Makes by much coying

Yet in a fine Net
That a Spider set

Had she not beene neere him
And chanced to heare him

Most good , most faire
Or Thing as rare

To call you 's lost
For all the cost

Words can bestow
So poorely show

Vpon your prayse
That all the wayes

Sense hath , come short
Whereby Report

Falls them vnder
That when Wonder

More hath seyzed
Yet not pleased

That it in kinde
Nothing can finde

You to expresse
Neuerthelesse

As by Globes small
This Mightie ALL

Is shew 'd , though farre
From Life , each Starre

A World being
So wee seeing

You , like as that
Onely trust what

Art doth vs teach
And when I reach

At Morall Things
And that my Strings

Grauely should strike
Straight some mislike

Blotteth mine ODE
As with the Loade

The Steele we touch
Forced ne ' r so much

Yet still remoues
To that it loues

Till there it stayes
So to your prayse

I turne euer
And though neuer

From you mouing
Happie so louing

It should be in Your praise
For there is no Bayes

Can be set aboue you
S ' impossibly I loue You

In my cleere Poesie
That I oft deny

You so ample Merit
The freedome of my Spirit

Vrging the _Salique_ Lawes
But your Vertue drawes

From me euery due
Thus still You me pursue

Who naturally rebell
Of You that excell

That should I still Endyte
Yet will You want some Ryte

That Honour still pursue
Goe , and subdue

And with a merry Gale
Swell your stretch 'd Sayle

Rocks , Lee-shores , nor Sholes
When EOLVS scowles

To get the Pearle and Gold
And ours to hold

And the Fruitfull'st Soyle
Without your Toyle

The cedar reaching hie
To kisse the Sky

No other Cares that tend
But Them to defend

Aboue the Seas that flowes
The cleere Wind throwes

O you the happy'st men
Be Frolike then

As those from whom We came
And plant Our name

APOLLO 'S Sacred tree
You may it see

Whose Reading shall inflame
Men to seeke Fame

The Ryme nor marres , nor makes
Nor addeth it , nor takes

Things imaginarie
Doe so strangely varie

And what 's quickly begot
As soone againe is not

Yea , and what 's borne with paine
That Sense doth long'st retaine

Yet this Critick so sterne
But whom , none must discerne

Strangely layes about him
As nothing without him

That I my selfe betray
To that most publique way

Custome , that doth humor
And by idle rumor

That whilst he still prefers
Those that be wholly hers

I creepe behind the Time
From spertling with their Crime

O wretched World the while
When the euill most vile

And inconstant lightnesse
With a scornefull slightnesse

Whilst this strange knowing Beast
Man , of himselfe the least

Makes Vertue to descend
Her title to defend

Yet these me not delude
Nor from my place extrude

Their vilenesse that doe know
Which to my selfe I show

Her lou 'd I most
By thee that 's lost

She was my gaine
But to my paine

The Ship full fraught
With Gold , farre sought

May suffer wracke
In sayling backe

But shee , good Sir
Did not preferre

But for that shee
Found faith in mee

Therefore boast not
Your happy Lot

The time I knew
She slighted you

None stands so fast
But may be cast

Once did I weare
Her Garter there

I had the Vow
That thou hast now

Her Loue to mee
And she to thee

She hath no Smile
That can beguile

Yea , to a Hayre
Both when and where

What now is thine
Was onely mine

Thou laugh'st at mee
I laugh at thee

But Ile not mourne
But stay my Turne

And once againe
May bring me in

The Muse should be sprightly
Yet not handling lightly

Things graue ; as much loath
Things that be slight , to cloath

Curiously : To retayne
The Comelinesse in meane

Is true Knowledge and Wit
Not me forc 'd Rage doth fit

That I thereto should lacke
Tabacco , or need Sacke

Which to the colder Braine
Is the true _Hyppocrene_

Nor did I euer care
For great Fooles , nor them spare

Vertue , though neglected
Is not so deiected

As vilely to descend
To low Basenesse their end

Neyther each ryming Slaue
Deserues the Name to haue

Of Poet : so the Rabble
Of Fooles , for the Table

That haue their Iests by Heart
As an Actor his Part

Might assume them Chayres
Amongst the Muses Heyres

_Parnassus_ is not clome
By euery such Mome

Vp whose steep side who swerues
It behoues t ' haue strong Nerues

My Resolution such
How well , and not how much

To write , thus doe I fare
Like some few good that care

( The euill sort among
How well to liue , and not how long

Good Folke , for Gold or Hyre
But helpe me to a Cryer

For my poore Heart is runne astray
After two Eyes , that pass 'd this way

If there be any Man
In Towne or Countrey , can

Bring me my Heart againe
Ile please him for his paine

And by these Marks I will you show
That onely I this Heart doe owe

It is a wounded Heart
Wherein yet sticks the Dart

Couentry , that do'st adorne
The Countrey wherein I was borne

Yet therein lyes not thy prayse
Why I should crowne thy Tow'rs with Bayes

'T is not thy Wall , me to thee weds
Thy Ports , nor thy proud Pyrameds

Nor thy Trophies of the Bore
But that Shee which I adore

Which scarce Goodnesse selfe can payre
First their breathing blest thy Ayre

IDEA , in which Name I hide
Her , in my heart Deified

For what good , Man 's mind can see
Onely her IDEAS be

She , in whom the Vertues came
In Womans shape , and tooke her Name

She so farre past Imitation
As but Nature our Creation

Could not alter , she had aymed
More then Woman to haue framed

She , whose truely written Story
To thy poore Name shall adde more glory

Then if it should haue beene thy Chance
T ' haue bred our Kings that Conquer 'd _France_

Had She beene borne the former Age
That house had beene a Pilgrimage

And reputed more Diuine
Then _Walsingham_ or BECKETS Shrine

That Princesse , to whom thou do'st owe
Thy Freedome , whose Cleere blushing snow

The enuious Sunne saw , when as she
Naked rode to make Thee free

Was but her Type , as to foretell
Thou should'st bring forth one , should excell

Her Bounty , by whom thou should'st haue
More Honour , then she Freedome gaue

And that great Queene , which but of late
Rul 'd this Land in Peace and State

Had not beene , but Heauen had sworne
A Maide should raigne , when she was borne

Of thy Streets , which thou hold'st best
And most frequent of the rest

Happy _Mich-Parke_ eu'ry yeere
On the fourth of _August_ there

Let thy Maides from FLORA 'S bowers
With their Choyce and daintiest flowers

Decke Thee vp , and from their store
With braue Garlands crowne that dore

The old Man passing by that way
To his Sonne in time shall say

There was that Lady borne , which long
To after-Ages shall be sung

Who vnawares being passed by
Back to that House shall cast his Eye

Speaking my Verses as he goes
And with a Sigh shut eu'ry Close

Deare Citie , trauelling by thee
When thy rising Spyres I see

Destined her place of Birth
Yet me thinkes the very Earth

Hallowed is , so farre as I
Can thee possibly descry

Then thou dwelling in this place
Hearing some rude Hinde disgrace

Thy Citie with some scuruy thing
Which some Iester forth did bring

Speake these Lines where thou do'st come
And strike the Slaue for euer dumbe

Faire stood the Wind for _France_
When we our Sayles aduance

But putting to the Mayne
At _Kaux_ , the Mouth of _Sene_

And taking many a Fort
Furnish 'd in Warlike sort

Skirmishing day by day
With those that stop 'd his way

Which in his Hight of Pride
King HENRY to deride

Which he neglects the while
As from a Nation vile

And turning to his Men
Quoth our braue HENRY then

Yet haue we well begunne
Battels so brauely wonne

And , for my Selfe ( quoth he
This my full rest shall be

Victor I will remaine
Or on this Earth lie slaine

_Poiters_ and _Cressy_ tell
When most their Pride did swell

Than when our Grandsire Great
Clayming the Regall Seate

The Duke of _Yorke_ so dread
The eager Vaward led

EXCESTER had the Rere
A Brauer man not there

They now to fight are gone
Armour on Armour shone

That with the Cryes they make
The very Earth did shake

Well it thine Age became
O Noble ERPINGHAM

When from a Medow by
Like a Storme suddenly

With _Spanish_ Ewgh so strong
Arrowes a Cloth-yard long

None from his fellow starts
But playing Manly parts

When downe their Bowes they threw
And forth their Bilbowes drew

Armes were from shoulders sent
Scalpes to the Teeth were rent

This while our Noble King
His broad Sword brandishing

And many a deepe Wound lent
His Armes with Bloud besprent

GLOSTER , that Duke so good
Next of the Royall Blood

CLARENCE , in Steele so bright
Though but a Maiden Knight

WARWICK in Bloud did wade
OXFORD the Foe inuade

SVFFOLKE his Axe did ply
BEAVMONT and WILLOVGHBY

Vpon Saint CRISPIN 'S day
Fought was this Noble Fray

O , when shall _English_ Men
With such Acts fill a Pen

Singe wee the Rose
Then which no flower there growes

And aptly her compare
With what in that is rare

Or made poses
Of this that incloses

That naturally flusheth
As she blusheth

Or if strewed
When with the morning dewed

Or howe to sense exposed
All which in her inclosed

That most renowned
By Nature richly crownd

Of that delitious layre
And as pure , her hayre

Fearing of harme
Nature that flower doth arme

The touch giues her offence
But with reuerence

That redde , or white
Or mixt , the sence delyte

In her complexion
All which perfection

That deuyded
Ere it was descided

Began the greeuous war
Of _York_ and _Lancaster_

Conflicts as greate
As were in all that heate

By her , as many harts
As men on either parts

The Primrose flower
The first of _Flora's_ bower

Soo is shee first as best
Though excellent the rest

That ten-yeares-trauell 'd _Greeke_ return 'd from Sea
Ne ' r ioyd so much to see his _Ithaca_

As I should you , who are alone to me
More then wide _Greece_ could to that wanderer be

The winter windes still Easterly doe keepe
And with keene Frosts haue chained vp the deepe

The Sunne 's to vs a niggard of his Rayes
But reuelleth with our _Antipodes_

And seldome to vs when he shewes his head
Muffled in vapours , he straight hies to bed

In those bleake mountaines can you liue where snowe
Maketh the vales vp to the hilles to growe

Whereas mens breathes doe instantly congeale
And attom 'd mists turne instantly to hayle

Belike you thinke , from this more temperate cost
My sighes may haue the power to thawe the frost

Which I from hence should swiftly send you thither
Yet not so swift , as you come slowly hither

How many a time , hath _Phebe_ from her wayne
With _Phoebus_ fires fill 'd vp her hornes againe

Shee through her Orbe , still on her course doth range
But you keep yours still , nor for me will change

The Sunne that mounted the sterne Lions back
Shall with the Fishes shortly diue the Brack

But still you keepe your station , which confines
You , nor regard him trauelling the signes

Those ships which when you went , put out to Sea
Both to our _Groenland_ , and _Virginia_

Are now return 'd , and Custom 'd haue their fraught
Yet you arriue not , nor returne me ought

The Thames was not so frozen yet this yeare
As is my bosome , with the chilly feare

Of your not comming , which on me doth light
As on those Climes , where halfe the world is night

Of euery tedious houre you haue made two
All this long Winter here , by missing you

Minutes are months , and when the houre is past
A yeare is ended since the Clocke strooke last

When your Remembrance puts me on the Racke
And I should Swound to see an _Almanacke_

To reade what silent weekes away are slid
Since the dire Fates you from my sight haue hid

I hate him who the first Deuisor was
Of this same foolish thing , the Hower-glasse

And of the Watch , whose dribbling sands and Wheele
With their slow stroakes , make mee too much to feele

Your slackenesse hither , O how I doe ban
Him that these Dialls against walles began

Whose Snayly motion of the moouing hand
( Although it goe ) yet seeme to me to stand

As though at _Adam_ it had first set out
And had been stealing all this while about

And when it backe to the first point should come
It shall be then iust at the generall Doome

The Seas into themselues retract their flowes
The changing Winde from euery quarter blowes

Declining Winter in the Spring doth call
The Starrs rise to vs , as from vs they fall

Those Birdes we see , that leaue vs in the Prime
Againe in Autumne re-salute our Clime

Sure , either Nature you from kinde hath made
Or you delight else to be Retrograde

But I perceiue by your attractiue powers
Like an Inchantresse you haue charm 'd the bowers

Into short minutes , and haue drawne them back
So that of vs at _London_ , you doe lack

Almost a yeare , the Spring is scarce begonne
There where you liue , and Autumne almost done

With vs more Eastward , surely you deuise
By your strong Magicke , that the Sunne shall rise

Where now it setts , and that in some few yeares
You ' l alter quite the Motion of the Spheares

Yes , and you meane , I shall complaine my loue
To grauell 'd Walkes , or to a stupid Groue

Now your companions ; and that you the while
( As you are cruell ) will sit by and smile

To make me write to these , while Passers by
Sleightly looke in your louely face , where I

See Beauties heauen , whilst silly blockheads , they
Like laden Asses , plod vpon their way

And wonder not , as you should point a Clowne
Vp to the _Guards_ , or _Ariadnes_ Crowne

Of Constellations , and his dulnesse tell
Hee 'd thinke your words were certainly a Spell

Or him some piece from _Creet_ , or _Marcus_ show
In all his life which till that time ne ' r saw

Painting : except in Alehouse or old Hall
Done by some Druzzler , of the Prodigall

Nay doe , stay still , whilst time away shall steale
Your youth , and beautie , and your selfe conceale

From me I pray you , you haue now inured
Me to your absence , and I haue endured

Your want this long , whilst I haue starued bine
For your short Letters , as you helde it sinne

To write to me , that to appease my woe
I reade ore those , you writ a yeare agoe

Which are to me , as though they had bin made
Long time before the first _Olympiad_

For thankes and curt'sies sell your presence then
To tatling Women , and to things like men

And be more foolish then the _Indians_ are
For Bells , for Kniues , for Glasses , and such ware

That sell their Pearle and Gold , but here I stay
So I would not haue you but come away

Friend , if you thinke my Papers may supplie
You , with some strange omitted Noueltie

Which others Letters yet haue left vntould
You take me off , before I can take hould

Of you at all ; I put not thus to Sea
For two monthes Voyage to _Virginia_

With newes which now , a little something here
But will be nothing ere it can come there

I feare , as I doe Stabbing ; this word , State
I dare not speake of the _Palatinate_

Although some men make it their hourely theame
And talke what 's done in _Austria_ , and in _Beame_

I may not so ; what _Spinola_ intends
Nor with his _Dutch_ , which way Prince _Maurice_ bends

To other men , although these things be free
Yet ( GEORGE ) they must be misteries to mee

I scarce dare praise a vertuous friend that 's dead
Lest for my lines he should be censured

It was my hap before all other men
To suffer shipwrack by my forward pen

When King IAMES entred ; at which ioyfull time
I taught his title to this Ile in rime

And to my part did all the Muses win
With high-pitch _PÃƒÂ¦ans_ to applaud him in

When cowardise had tyed vp euery tongue
And all stood silent , yet for him I sung

And when before by danger I was dared
I kick 'd her from me , nor a iot I spared

Yet had not my cleere spirit in Fortunes scorne
Me aboue earth and her afflictions borne

He next my God on whom I built my trust
Had left me troden lower then the dust

But let this passe ; in the extreamest ill
_Apollo's_ brood must be couragious still

Let Pies , and Dawes , sit dumb before their death
Onely the Swan sings at the parting breath

And ( worthy GEORGE ) by industry and vse
Let 's see what lines _Virginia_ will produce

Goe on with OVID , as you haue begunne
With the first fiue Bookes ; let your numbers run

Glib as the former , so shall it liue long
And doe much honour to the _English_ tongue

Intice the Muses thither to repaire
Intreat them gently , trayne them to that ayre

For they from hence may thither hap to fly
T'wards the sad time which but to fast doth hie

For Poesie is follow 'd with such spight
By groueling drones that neuer raught her height

That she must hence , she may no longer staye
The driery fates prefixed haue the day

Of her departure , which is now come on
And they command her straight wayes to be gon

That bestiall heard so hotly her pursue
And to her succour , there be very few

Nay none at all , her wrongs that will redresse
But she must wander in the wildernesse

Like to the woman , which that holy IOHN
Beheld in _Pathmos_ in his vision

As th ' _English_ now , so did the stiff-neckt _Iewes_
Their noble Prophets vtterly refuse

And of these men such poore opinions had
They counted _Esay_ and _Ezechiel_ mad

When _Ieremy_ his Lamentations writ
They thought the Wizard quite out of his wit

Such sots they were , as worthily to ly
Lock't in the chaines of their captiuity

Knowledge hath still her Eddy in her Flow
So it hath beene , and it will still be so

That famous _Greece_ where learning flourisht most
Hath of her muses long since left to boast

Th ' vnlettered _Turke_ , and rude _Barbarian_ trades
Where HOMER sang his lofty _Iliads_

And this vaste volume of the world hath taught
Much may to passe in little time be brought

As if to _Symptoms_ we may credit giue
This very time , wherein we two now liue

Shall in the compasse , wound the Muses more
Then all the old _English_ ignorance before

Base Balatry is so belou 'd and sought
And those braue numbers are put by for naught

Which rarely read , were able to awake
Bodyes from graues , and to the ground to shake

The wandring clouds , and to our men at armes
'Gainst pikes and muskets were most powerfull charmes

That , but I know , insuing ages shall
Raise her againe , who now is in her fall

And out of dust reduce our scattered rimes
Th ' reiected iewels of these slothfull times

Who with the Muses would misspend an hower
But let blind Gothish Barbarisme deuoure

These feuerous Dogdays , blest by no record
But to be euerlastingly abhord

If you vouchsafe rescription , stuffe your quill
With naturall bountyes , and impart your skill

In the description of the place , that I
May become learned in the soyle thereby

Of noble _Wyats_ health , and let me heare
The Gouernour ; and how our people there

Increase and labour , what supplyes are sent
Which I confesse shall giue me much content

But you may saue your labour if you please
To write to me ought of your Sauages

As sauage slaues be in great _Britaine_ here
As any one that you can shew me there

And though for this , Ile say I doe not thirst
Yet I should like it well to be the first

Whose numbers hence into _Virginia_ flew
So ( noble _Sandis_ ) for this time adue

Deare friend , be silent and with patience see
What this mad times Catastrophe will be

The worlds first Wisemen certainly mistooke
Themselues , and spoke things quite beside the booke

And that which they haue of said of God , vntrue
Or else expect strange iudgement to insue

This Isle is a meere Bedlam , and therein
We all lye rauing , mad in euery sinne

And him the wisest most men use to call
Who doth ( alone ) the maddest thing of all

He whom the master of all wisedome found
For a marckt foole , and so did him propound

The time we liue in , to that passe is brought
That only he a Censor now is thought

And that base villaine , ( not an age yet gone
Which a good man would not haue look 'd vpon

Now like a God , with diuine worship followed
And all his actions are accounted hollowed

This world of ours , thus runneth vpon wheeles
Set on the head , bolt vpright with her heeles

Which makes me thinke of what the _Ethnicks_ told
Th ' opinion , the Pythagorists vphold

That the immortall soule doth transmigrate
Then I suppose by the strong power of fate

Through fools , and beasts , and lunatiques haue past
Are heere imbodyed in this age at last

And though so long we from that time be gone
Yet taste we still of that confusion

For certainely there 's scarse one found that now
Knowes what t ' approoue , or what to disallow

All arsey varsey , nothing is it 's owne
But to our prouerbe , all turnd vpside downe

To doe in time , is to doe out of season
And that speeds best , thats done the farth'st from reason

Hee 's high'st that 's low'st , hee 's surest in that 's out
He hits the next way that goes farth'st about

He getteth vp vnlike to rise at all
He slips to ground as much vnlike to fall

Which doth inforce me partly to prefer
The opinion of that mad Philosopher

Who taught , that those all-framing powers aboue
( As 't is suppos 'd ) made man not out of loue

To him at all , but only as a thing
To make them sport with , which they vse to bring

As men doe munkeys , puppets , and such tooles
Of laughter : so men are but the Gods fooles

Such are by titles lifted to the sky
As wherefore no man knowes , God scarcely why

The vertuous man depressed like a stone
For that dull Sot to raise himselfe vpon

He who ne 're thing yet worthy man durst doe
Neuer durst looke vpon his countrey 's foe

Nor durst attempt that action which might get
Him fame with men : or higher might him set

Then the base begger ( rightly if compared
This Drone yet neuer braue attempt that dared

Yet dares be knighted , and from thence dares grow
To any title Empire can bestow

For this beleeue , that Impudence is now
A Cardinall vertue , and men it allow

Reuerence , nay more , men study and inuent
New wayes , nay , glory to be impudent

Into the clouds the Deuill lately got
And by the moisture doubting much the rot

A medicine tooke to make him purge and cast
Which in short time began to worke so fast

That he fell too 't , and from his backeside flew
A rout of rascall a rude ribauld crew

Of base Plebeians , which no sooner light
Vpon the earth , but with a suddaine flight

They spread this Ile , and as _Deucalion_ once
Ouer his shoulder backe , by throwing stones

They became men , euen so these beasts became
Owners of titles from an obscure name

He that by riot , of a mighty rent
Hath his late goodly Patrimony spent

And into base and wilfull beggery run
This man as he some glorious acte had done

With some great pension , or rich guift releeued
When he that hath by industry atchieued

Some noble thing , contemned and disgraced
In the forlorne hope of the times is placed

As though that God had carelessely left all
That being hath on this terrestriall ball

To fortunes guiding , nor would haue to doe
With man , nor aught that doth belong him to

Or at the least God hauing giuen more
Power to the Deuill , then he did of yore

Ouer this world : the feind as he doth hate
The vertuous man ; maligning his estate

All noble things , and would haue by his will
To be damn 'd with him , vsing all his skill

By his blacke hellish ministers to vexe
All worthy men , and strangely to perplexe

Their constancie , there by them so to fright
That they should yeeld them wholely to his might

But of these things I vainely doe but tell
Where hell is heauen , and heau'n is now turn 'd hell

Where that which lately blasphemy hath bin
Now godlinesse , much lesse accounted sin

And a long while I greatly meruail 'd why
Buffoons and Bawdes should hourely multiply

Till that of late I construed it that they
To present thrift had got the perfect way

When I concluded by their odious crimes
It was for vs no thriuing in these times

As men oft laugh at little Babes , when they
Hap to behold some strange thing in their play

To see them on the suddaine strucken sad
As in their fancie some strange formes they had

Which they by pointing with their fingers showe
Angry at our capacities so slowe

That by their countenance we no sooner learne
To see the wonder which they so discerne

So the celestiall powers doe sit and smile
At innocent and vertuous men the while

They stand amazed at the world ore-gone
So farre beyond imagination

With slauish basenesse , that the silent sit
Pointing like children in describing it

Then noble friend the next way to controule
These worldly crosses , is to arme thy soule

With constant patience : and with thoughts as high
As these be lowe , and poore , winged to flye

To that exalted stand , whether yet they
Are got with paine , that sit out of the way

Of this ignoble age , which raiseth none
But such as thinke their black damnation

To be a trifle ; such , so ill , that when
They are aduanc 'd , those few poore honest men

That yet are liuing , into search doe runne
To finde what mischiefe they haue lately done

Which so preferres them ; say thou he doth rise
That maketh vertue his chiefe exercise

And in this base world come what euer shall
Hees worth lamenting , that for her doth fall

Light Sonnets hence , and to loose Louers flie
And mournfull Maydens sing an Elegie

On those three SHEFFIELDS , ouer-whelm 'd with waues
Whose losse the teares of all the Muses craues

A thing so full of pitty as this was
Me thinkes for nothing should not slightly passe

Treble this losse was , why should it not borrowe
Through this Iles treble parts , a treble sorrowe

But Fate did this , to let the world to knowe
That sorrowes which from common causes growe

Are not worth mourning for , the losse to beare
But of one onely sonne , 's not worth one teare

Some tender-hearted man , as I , may spend
Some drops ( perhaps ) for a deceased friend

Some men ( perhaps ) their Wifes late death may rue
Or Wifes their Husbands , but such be but fewe

Cares that haue vs 'd the hearts of men to tuch
So oft , and deepely , will not now be such

Who 'll care for loss of maintenance , or place
Fame , liberty , or of the Princes grace

Or sutes in law , by base corruption crost
When he shall finde , that this which he hath lost

Alas , is nothing to his , which did lose
Three sonnes at once so excellent as those

Nay , it is feard that this in time may breed
Hard hearts in men to their owne naturall seed

That in respect of this great losse of theirs
Men will scarce mourne the death of their owne heires

Through all this Ile their losse so publique is
That euery man doth take them to be his

And as a plague which had beginning there
So catching is , and raigning euery where

That those the farthest off as much doe rue them
As those the most familiarly that knew them

Children with this disaster are wext sage
And like to men that strucken are in age

Talke what it is , three children at one time
Thus to haue drown 'd , and in their very prime

Yea , and doe learne to act the same so well
That then olde folke , they better can it tell

Inuention , oft that Passion vs 'd to faine
In sorrowes of themselves but slight , and meane

To make them seeme great , here it shall not need
For that this Subiect doth so farre exceed

All forc 'd Expression , that what Poesie shall
Happily thinke to grace it selfe withall

Falls so belowe it , that it rather borrowes
Grace from their griefe , then addeth to their sorrowes

For sad mischance thus in the losse of three
To shewe it selfe the vtmost it could bee

Exacting also by the selfe same lawe
The vtmost teares that sorrowe had to drawe

All future times hath vtterly preuented
Of a more losse , or more to be lamented

Whilst in faire youth they liuely flourish 'd here
To their kinde Parents they were onely deere

But being dead , now euery one doth take
Them for their owne , and doe like sorrowe make

As for their owne begot , as they pretended
Hope in the issue , which should haue discended

From them againe ; nor here doth end our sorrow
But those of vs , that shall be borne to morrowe

Still shall lament them , and when time shall count
To what vast number passed yeares shall mount

They from their death shall duly reckon so
As from the Deluge , former vs 'd to doe

O cruell _Humber_ guilty of their gore
I now beleeue more then I did before

The _Brittish_ Story , whence thy name begun
Of Kingly _Humber_ , an inuading _Hun_

By thee deuoured , for't is likely thou
With blood wert Christned , bloud-thirsty till now

The _Ouse_ , the _Done_ , and thou farre clearer _Trent_
To drowne the SHEFFIELDS as you gaue consent

Shall curse the time , that ere you were infused
Which haue your waters basely thus abused

The groueling Boore yee hinder not to goe
And at his pleasure Ferry to and fro

The very best part of whose soule , and bloud
Compared with theirs , is viler then your mud

But wherefore paper , doe I idely spend
On those deafe waters to so little end

And vp to starry heauen doe I not looke
In which , as in an euerlasting booke

Our ends are written ; O let times rehearse
Their fatall losse , in their sad Aniuerse

Madame , to shew the smoothnesse of my vaine
Neither that I would haue you entertaine

The time in reading me , which you would spend
In faire discourse with some knowne honest friend

I write not to you . Nay , and which is more
My powerfull verses striue not to restore

What time and sicknesse haue in you impaired
To other ends my Elegie is squared

Your beauty , sweetnesse , and your gracefull parts
That haue drawne many eyes , wonne many hearts

Of me get little , I am so much man
That let them doe their vtmost that they can

I will resist their forces : and they be
Though great to others , yet not so to me

The first time I beheld you , I then sawe
That ( in it selfe ) which had the power to drawe

My stayd affection , and thought to allowe
You some deale of my heart ; but you have now

Got farre into it , and you haue the skill
( For ought I see ) to winne vpon me still

When I doe thinke how brauely you haue borne
Your many crosses , as in Fortunes scorne

And how neglectfull you have seem 'd to be
Of that which hath seem 'd terrible to me

I thought you stupid , nor that you had felt
Those griefes which ( often ) I haue scene to melt

Another woman into sighes and teares
A thing but seldome in your sexe and yeares

But when in you I haue perceiu 'd agen
( Noted by me , more then by other men

How feeling and how sensible you are
Of your friends sorrowes , and with how much care

You seeke to cure them , then my selfe I blame
That I your patience should so much misname

Which to my vnderstanding maketh knowne
Who feeles anothers griefe , can feele their owne

When straight me thinkes , I heare your patience say
Are you the man that studied _Seneca_

_Plinies_ most learned letters ; and must I
Read you a Lecture in Philosophie

T'auoid the afflictions that haue vs 'd to reach you
I'le learne you more , Sir , then your bookes can teach you

Of all your sex , yet neuer did I knowe
Any that yet so actually could showe

Such rules for patience , such an easie way
That who so sees it , shall be forc 'd to say

Loe what before seem 'd hard to be discerned
Is of this Lady , in an instant learned

It is heauens will that you should wronged be
By the malicious , that the world might see

Your Doue-like meekenesse ; for had the base scumme
The spawne of Fiends , beene in your slander dumbe

Your vertue then had perish 'd , neuer prized
For that the same you had not exercised

And you had lost the Crowne you haue , and glory
Nor had you beene the subiect of my Story

Whilst they feele Hell , being damned in their hate
Their thoughts like Deuils them excruciate

Which by your noble suffrings doe torment
Them with new paines , and giues you this content

To see your soule an Innocent , hath suffred
And vp to heauen before your eyes be offred

Your like we in a burning Glasse may see
When the Sunnes rayes therein contracted be

Bent on some obiect , which is purely white
We finde that colour doth dispierce the light

And stands vntainted : but if it hath got
Some little sully ; or the least small spot

Then it soon fiers it ; so you still remaine
Free , because in you they can finde no staine

God doth not loue them least , on whom he layes
The great'st afflictions ; but that he will praise

Himselfe most in them , and will make them fit
Near'st to himselfe who is the Lambe to sit

For by that touch , like perfect gold he tries them
Who are not his , vntill the world denies them

And your example may work such effect
That it may be the beginning of a Sect

Of patient women ; and that many a day
All Husbands may for you their Founder pray

Nor is to me your Innocence the lesse
In that I see you striue not to suppresse

Their barbarous malice ; but your noble heart
Prepar 'd to act so difficult a part

With vnremoued constancie is still
The same it was , that of your proper ill

The effect proceeds from your owne selfe the cause
Like some iust Prince , who to establish lawes

Suffers the breach at his best lou 'd to strike
To learne the vulgar to endure the like

You are a Martir thus , nor can you be
Lesse to the world so valued by me

If as you haue begun , you still perseuer
Be euer good , that I may loue you euer

Must I needes write , who 's hee that can refuse
He wants a minde , for her that hath no Muse

The thought of her doth heau'nly rage inspire
Next powerfull , to those clouen tongues of fire

Since I knew ought time neuer did allowe
Me stuffe fit for an Elegie , till now

When _France_ and _England's_ HENRIES dy 'd , my quill
Why , I know not , but it that time lay still

'T is more then greatnesse that my spirit must raise
To obserue custome I vse not to praise

Nor the least thought of mine yet ere depended
On any one from whom she was descended

That for their fauour I this way should wooe
As some poor wretched things ( perhaps ) may doe

I gaine the end , whereat I onely ayme
If by my freedome , I may giue her fame

Walking then forth being newly vp from bed
O Sir ( quoth one ) the Lady CLIFTON 'S dead

When , but that reason my sterne rage withstood
My hand had sure beene guilty of his blood

If shee be so , must thy rude tongue confesse it
( Quoth I ) and com'st so coldly to expresse it

Thou shouldst haue giuen a shreeke , to make me feare thee
That might haue slaine what euer had beene neere thee

Thou shouldst haue com'n like Time with thy scalpe bare
And in thy hands thou shouldst haue brought thy haire

Casting vpon me such a dreadfull looke
As seene a spirit , or th'adst beene thunder-strooke

And gazing on me so a little space
Thou shouldst haue shot thine eye balls in my face

Then falling at my feet , thou shouldst haue said
O she is gone , and Nature with her dead

With this ill newes amaz 'd by chance I past
By that neere Groue , whereas both first and last

I saw her , not three moneths before shee died
When ( though full Summer gan to vaile her pride

And that I sawe men leade home ripened Corne
Besides aduis 'd me well , ) I durst haue sworne

The lingring yeare , the Autumne had adiourned
And the fresh Spring had beene againe returned

Her delicacie , louelinesse , and grace
With such a Summer brauery deckt the place

But now alas , it lookt forlorne and dead
And where she stood , the fading leaues were shed

Presenting onely sorrowe to my sight
O God ( thought I ) this is her Embleme right

And sure I thinke it can not but be thought
That I to her by prouidence was brought

For that the Fates fore-dooming , shee should die
Shewed me this wondrous Master peece , that I

Should sing her Funerall , that the world should know it
That heauen did thinke her worthy of a Poet

My hand is fatall , nor doth fortune doubt
For what it writes , not fire shall ere race out

A thousand silken Puppets should haue died
And in their fulsome Coffins putrified

Ere in my lines , you of their names should heare
To tell the world that such there euer were

Whose memory shall from the earth decay
Before those Rags be worne they gaue away

Had I her god-like features neuer seene
Poore slight Report had tolde me she had beene

A hansome Lady , comely , very well
And so might I haue died an Infidell

As many doe which neuer did her see
Or can not credit , what she was , by mee

Nature , her selfe , that before Art prefers
To goe beyond all our Cosmographers

By Charts and Maps exactly that haue showne
All of this earth that euer can be knowne

For that she would beyond them all descrie
What Art could not by any mortall eye

A Map of heauen in her rare features drue
And that she did so liuely and so true

That any soule but seeing it might sweare
That all was perfect heauenly that was there

If euer any Painter were so blest
To drawe that face , which so much heau'n exprest

If in his best of skill he did her right
I wish it neuer may come in my sight

I greatly doubt my faith ( weake man ) lest I
Should to that face commit Idolatry

Death might haue tyth 'd her sex , but for this one
Nay , haue ta'n halfe to haue let her alone

Such as their wrinkled temples to supply
Cyment them vp with sluttish _Mercury_

Such as vndrest were able to affright
A valiant man approching him by night

Death might haue taken such , her end deferd
Vntill the time she had beene climaterd

When she would haue bin at threescore yeares and three
Such as our best at three and twenty be

With enuie then , he might haue ouerthrowne her
When age nor time had power to ceaze vpon her

But when the vnpittying Fates her end decreed
They to the same did instantly proceed

For well they knew ( if she had languish 'd so
As those which hence by naturall causes goe

So many prayers , and teares for her had spoken
As certainly their Iron lawes had broken

And had wak 'd heau'n , who clearely would haue showed
That change of Kingdomes to her death it owed

And that the world still of her end might thinke
It would haue let some Neighbouring mountaine sinke

Or the vast Sea it in on vs to cast
As _Seuerne_ did about some fiue yeares past

Or some sterne Comet his curld top to reare
Whose length should measure halfe our Hemisphere

Holding this height , to say some will not sticke
That now I raue , and am growne lunatique

You of what sexe so ere you be , you lye
'T is thou thy selfe is lunatique , not I

I charge you in her name that now is gone
That may coniure you , if you be not stone

That you no harsh , nor shallow rimes decline
Vpon that day wherein you shall read mine

Such as indeed are falsely termed verse
And will but sit like mothes vpon her herse

Nor that no child , nor chambermaide , nor page
Disturbe the Rome , the whilst my sacred rage

In reading is ; but whilst you heare it read
Suppose , before you , that you see her dead

The walls about you hung with mournfull blacke
And nothing of her funerall to lacke

And when this period giues you leaue to pause
Cast vp your eyes , and sigh for my applause

I many a time haue greatly marueil 'd , why
Men say , their friends depart when as they die

How well that word , a dying , doth expresse
I did not know ( I freely must confesse

Till her departure : for whose missed sight
I am enforc 'd this Elegy to write

But since resistlesse fate will haue it so
That she from hence must to _Iberia_ goe

And my weak wishes can her not detaine
I will of heauen in policy complaine

That it so long her trauell should adiourne
Hoping thereby to hasten her returne

Can those of _Norway_ for their wage procure
By their blacke spells a winde that shall endure

Till from aboard the wished land men see
And fetch the harbour , where they long to be

Can they by charmes doe this and can not I
Who am the Priest of _Phoebus_ , and so hie

Sit in his fauour , winne the Poets god
To send swift _Hermes_ with his snaky rod

To _Ãƒâ€ olus_ Caue , commanding him with care
His prosperous winds , that he for her prepare

And from that howre , wherein shee takes the seas
Nature bring on the quiet _Halcion_ dayes

And in that hower that bird begin her nest
Nay at that very instant , that long rest

May seize on _Neptune_ , who may still repose
And let that bird nere till that hower disclose

Wherein she landeth , and for all that space
Be not a wrinkle seene on _Thetis_ face

Onely so much breath with a gentle gale
As by the easy swelling of her saile

May at * _Sebastians_ safely set her downe
Where , with her goodnes she may blesse the towne

If heauen in iustice would haue plagu 'd by thee
Some Pirate , and grimme _Neptune_ thou should'st be

His Executioner , or what is his worse
The gripple Merchant , borne to be the curse

Of this braue Iland ; let them for her sake
Who to thy safeguard doth her selfe betake

Escape vndrown 'd , vnwrackt , nay rather let
Them be at ease in some safe harbour set

Where with much profit they may vent their wealth
That they haue got by villany and stealth

Rather great _Neptune_ , then when thou dost raue
Thou once shouldst wet her saile but with a waue

Or if some proling Rouer shall but dare
To seize the ship wherein she is to fare

Let the fell fishes of the Maine appeare
And tell those Sea-thiefes , that once such they were

As they are now , till they assaid to rape
Grape-crowned _Bacchus_ in a striplings shape

That came aboard them , and would faine haue saild
To vine-spread * _Naxus_ but that him they faild

Which he perceiuing , them so monstrous made
And warnd them how they passengers inuade

Ye South and Westerne winds now cease to blow
Autumne is come , there be no flowers to grow

Yea from that place respire , to which she goes
And to her sailes should show your selfe but foes

But _Boreas_ and yee Esterne windes arise
To send her soon to _Spaine_ , but be precise

That in your aide you seeme not still so sterne
As we a summer should no more discerne

For till that here againe , I may her see
It will be winter all the yeare with mee

Ye swanne-begotten lonely brother-stars
So oft auspicious to poore Mariners

Ye twin-bred lights of louely _Leda's_ brood
_Ioues_ egge-borne issue smile vpon the flood

And in your mild'st aspect doe ye appeare
To be her warrant from all future feare

And if thou ship that bear'st her , doe proue good
May neuer time by wormes , consume thy wood

Nor rust thy iron , may thy tacklings last
Till they for reliques be in temples plac't

Maist thou be ranged with that mighty Arke
Wherein iust _Noah_ did all the world imbarque

With that which after _Troyes_ so famous wracke
From ten yeares trauell brought _Vlisses_ backe

That Argo which to _Colchos_ went from _Greece_
And in her botome brought the goulden fleece

Vnder braue _Iason_ ; or that same of _Drake_
Wherein he did his famous voyage make

About the world ; or _Candishes_ that went
As far as his , about the Continent

And yee milde winds that now I doe implore
Not once to raise the least sand on the shore

Nor once on forfait of your selues respire
When once the time is come of her retire

If then it please you , but to doe your due
What for these windes I did , Ile doe for you

Ile wooe you then , and if that not suffice
My pen shall prooue you to haue dietyes

Ile sing your loues in verses that shall flow
And tell the storyes of your weale and woe

Ile prooue what profit to the earth you bring
And how t'is you that welcome in the spring

Ile raise vp altars to you , as to show
The time shall be kept holy , when you blow

O blessed winds ! your will that it may be
To send health to her , and her home to me

My dearely loued friend how oft haue we
In winter evenings ( meaning to be free

To some well-chosen place vs 'd to retire
And there with moderate meate , and wine , and fire

Haue past the howres contentedly with chat
Now talk of this , and then discours 'd of that

Spoke our owne verses 'twixt our selves , if not
Other mens lines , which we by chance had got

Or some Stage pieces famous long before
Of which your happy memory had store

And I remember you much pleased were
Of those who liued long agoe to heare

As well as of those , of these latter times
Who have inricht our language with their rimes

And in succession , how still vp they grew
Which is the subiect , that I now pursue

For from my cradle , ( you must know that ) I
Was still inclin 'd to noble Poesie

And when that once _Pueriles_ I had read
And newly had my _Cato_ construed

In my small selfe I greatly marueil 'd then
Amonst all other , what strange kinde of men

These Poets were ; And pleased with the name
To my milde Tutor merrily I came

( For I was then a proper goodly page
Much like a Pigmy , scarse ten yeares of age

Clasping my slender armes about his thigh
O my deare master ! can not you ( quoth I

Make me a Poet , doe it if you can
And you shall see , Ile quickly bee a man

Who me thus answered smiling , boy quoth he
If you'le not play the wag , but I may see

You ply your learning , I will shortly read
Some Poets to you ; _Phoebus_ be my speed

Too't hard went I , when shortly he began
And first read to me honest _Mantuan_

Then _Virgils Eglogues_ , being entred thus
Me thought I straight had mounted _Pegasus_

And in his full Careere could make him stop
And bound vpon _Parnassus ' _ by-clift top

I scornd your ballet then though it were done
And had for Finis , _William Elderton_

But soft , in sporting with this childish iest
I from my subiect haue too long digrest

Then to the matter that we tooke in hand
_Ioue_ and _Apollo_ for the _Muses_ stand

Then noble _Chaucer_ , in those former times
The first inrich 'd our _English_ with his rimes

And was the first of ours , that euer brake
Into the _Muses_ treasure , and first spake

In weighty numbers , deluing in the Mine
Of perfect knowledge , which he could refine

And coyne for currant , and as much as then
The _English_ language could expresse to men

He made it doe ; and by his wondrous skill
Gaue vs much light from his abundant quill

And honest _Gower_ , who in respect of him
Had only sipt at _Aganippas_ brimme

And though in yeares this last was him before
Yet fell he far short of the others store

When after those , foure ages very neare
They with the _Muses_ which conuersed , were

That Princely _Surrey_ , early in the time
Of the Eight _Henry_ , who was then the prime

Of _Englands_ noble youth ; with him there came
_Wyat_ ; with reuerence whom we still doe name

Amongst our Poets , _Brian_ had a share
With the two former , which accompted are

That times best makers , and the authors were
Of those small poems , which the title beare

Of songs and sonnets , wherein oft they hit
On many dainty passages of wit

_Gascoine_ and _Churchyard_ after them againe
In the beginning of _Eliza's_ raine

Accoumpted were great Meterers many a day
But not inspired with braue fier , had they

Liu 'd but a little longer , they had seene
Their works before them to have buried beene

Graue morrall _Spencer_ after these came on
Then whom I am perswaded there was none

Since the blind _Bard_ his _Iliads_ vp did make
Fitter a taske like that to vndertake

To set downe boldly , brauely to inuent
In all high knowledge , surely excellent

The noble _Sidney_ with this last arose
That _Heroe_ for numbers , and for Prose

That throughly pac 'd our language as to show
The plenteous _English_ hand in hand might goe

With _Greek_ or _Latine_ , and did first reduce
Our tongue from _Lillies_ writing then in vse

Talking of Stones , Stars , Plants , of fishes , Flyes
Playing with words , and idle Similies

As th ' _English_ , Apes and very Zanies be
Of euery thing , that they doe heare and see

So imitating his ridiculous tricks
They spake and writ , all like meere lunatiques

Then _Warner_ though his lines were not so trimed
Nor yet his Poem so exactly limed

And neatly ioynted , but the Criticke may
Easily reprooue him , yet thus let me say

For my old friend , some passages there be
In him , which I protest haue taken me

With almost wonder , so fine , cleere , and new
As yet they haue bin equalled by few

Neat _Marlow_ bathed in the _Thespian_ springs
Had in him those braue translunary things

That the first Poets had , his raptures were
All ayre , and fire , which made his verses cleere

For that fine madnes still he did retaine
Which rightly should possesse a Poets braine

And surely _Nashe_ , though he a Proser were
A branch of Lawrell yet deserues to beare

Sharply _Satirick_ was he , and that way
He went , since that his being , to this day

Few haue attempted , and I surely thinke
Those wordes shall hardly be set downe with inke

Shall scorch and blast , so as his could , where he
Would inflict vengeance , and be it said of thee

_Shakespeare_ , thou hadst as smooth a Comicke vaine
Fitting the socke , and in thy naturall braine

As strong conception , and as Cleere a rage
As any one that trafiqu 'd with the stage

Amongst these _Samuel Daniel_ , whom if I
May spake of , but to sensure doe denie

Onely haue heard some wisemen him rehearse
To be too much _Historian_ in verse

His rimes were smooth , his meeters well did close
But yet his maner better fitted prose

Next these , learn 'd _Johnson_ , in this List I bring
Who had drunke deepe of the _Pierian_ spring

Whose knowledge did him worthily prefer
And long was Lord here of the Theater

Who in opinion made our learn'st to sticke
Whether in Poems rightly dramatique

Strong _Seneca_ or _Plautus_ , he or they
Should beare the Buskin , or the Socke away

Others againe here liued in my dayes
That haue of vs deserued no lesse praise

For their translations , then the daintiest wit
That on _Parnassus_ thinks , he highst doth sit

And for a chaire may mongst the Muses call
As the most curious maker of them all

As reuerent _Chapman_ , who hath brought to vs
_MusÃƒÂ¦us_ , _Homer_ and _Hesiodus_

Out of the Greeke ; and by his skill hath reard
Them to that height , and to our tongue endeared

That were those Poets at this day aliue
To see their bookes thus with vs to suruiue

They would think , hauing neglected them so long
They had bin written in the _English_ tongue

And _Siluester_ who from the _French_ more weake
Made _Bartas_ of his sixe dayes labour speake

In naturall _English_ , who , had he there stayd
He had done well , and neuer had bewraid

His owne inuention , to haue bin so poore
Who still wrote lesse , in striuing to write more

Then dainty _Sands_ that hath to _English_ done
Smooth sliding _Ouid_ , and hath made him run

With so much sweetnesse and vnusuall grace
As though the neatnesse of the _English_ pace

Should tell the Ietting _Lattine_ that it came
But slowly after , as though stiff and lame

So _Scotland_ sent vs hither , for our owne
That man , whose name I euer would haue knowne

To stand by mine , that most ingenious knight
My _Alexander_ , to whom in his right

I want extreamely , yet in speaking thus
I doe but shew the loue , that was twixt vs

And not his numbers which were braue and hie
So like his mind , was his clear Poesie

And my deare _Drummond_ to whom much I owe
For his much loue , and proud I was to know

His poesie , for which two worthy men
I _Menstry_ still shall loue , and _Hauthorne-den_

Then the two _Beamounts_ and my _Browne_ arose
My deare companions whom I freely chose

My bosome friends ; and in their seuerall wayes
Rightly borne Poets , and in these last dayes

Men of much note , and no lesse nobler parts
Such as haue freely tould to me their hearts

As I have mine to them ; but if you shall
Say in your knowledge , that these be not all

Haue writ in numbers , be inform 'd that I
Only my selfe , to these few men doe tye

Whose works oft printed , set on euery post
To publique censure subiect haue bin most

For such whose poems , be they nere so rare
In priuate chambers , that incloistered are

And by transcription daintyly must goe
As though the world vnworthy were to know

Their rich composures , let those men that keepe
These wonderous reliques in their iudgement deepe

And cry them vp so , let such Peeces bee
Spoke of by those that shall come after me

I passe not for them : nor doe meane to run
In quest of these , that them applause haue wonne

Vpon our Stages in these latter dayes
That are so many , let them haue their bayes

That doe deserue it ; let those wits that haunt
Those publique circuits , let them freely chaunt

Their fine Composures , and their praise pursue
And so my deare friend , for this time adue

Could there be words found to expresse my losse
There were some hope , that this my heauy crosse

Might be sustained , and that wretched I
Might once finde comfort : but to haue him die

Past all degrees that was so deare to me
As but comparing him with others , hee

Was such a thing , as if some Power should say
I'le take Man on me , to shew men the way

What a friend should be . But words come so short
Of him , that when I thus would him report

I am vndone , and hauing nought to say
Mad at my selfe , I throwe my penne away

And beate my breast , that there should be a woe
So high , that words can not attaine thereto

T'is strange that I from my abundant breast
Who others sorrowes haue so well exprest

Yet I by this in little time am growne
So poore , that I want to expresse mine owne

I thinke the Fates perceiuing me to beare
My worldly crosses without wit or feare

Nay , with what scorne I euer haue derided
Those plagues that for me they haue oft prouided

Drew them to counsaile ; nay , conspired rather
And in this businesse laid their heads together

To finde some one plague , that might me subuert
And at an instant breake my stubborne heart

They did indeede , and onely to this end
They tooke from me this more then man , or friend

Hard-hearted Fates , your worst thus haue you done
Then let vs see what lastly you haue wonne

By this your rigour , in a course so strict
Why see , I beare all that you can inflict

And hee from heauen your poore reuenge to view
Laments my losse of him , but laughes at you

Whilst I against you execrations breath
Thus are you scorn 'd aboue , and curst beneath

Me thinks that man ( vnhappy though he be
Is now thrice happy in respect of me

Who hath no friend ; for that in hauing none
He is not stirr 'd as I am , to bemone

My miserable losse , who but in vaine
May euer looke to find the like againe

This more then mine own selfe ; that who had seene
His care of me where euer I had beene

And had not knowne his actiue spirit before
Vpon some braue thing working euermore

He would haue sworne that to no other end
He had been borne : but onely for my friend

I had been happy if nice Nature had
( Since now my lucke falls out to be so bad

Made me vnperfect , either of so soft
And yeelding temper , that lamenting oft

I into teares my mournefull selfe might melt
Or else so dull , my losse not to haue felt

I haue by my too deare experience bought
That fooles and mad men , whom I euer thought

The most vnhappy , are in deede not so
And therefore I lesse pittie can bestowe

( Since that my sence , my sorrowe so can sound
On those in Bedlam that are bound

And scarce feele scourging ; and when as I meete
A foole by Children followed in the Streete

Thinke I ( poor wretch ) thou from my griefe art free
Nor couldst thou feele it , should it light on thee

But that I am a _Christian_ , and am taught
By him who with his precious bloud me bought

Meekly like him my crosses to endure
Else would they please me well , that for their cure

When as they feele their conscience doth them brand
Vpon themselues dare lay a violent hand

Not suffering Fortune with her murdering knife
Stand like a Surgeon working on the life

Deserting this part , that ioynt off to cut
Shewing that Artire , ripping then that gut

Whilst the dull beastly World with her squint eye
Is to behold the strange Anatomie

I am persuaded that those which we read
To be man-haters , were not so indeed

The Athenian _Timon_ , and beside him more
Of which the _Latines_ , as the _Greekes_ haue store

Nor not did they all humane manners hate
Nor yet maligne mans dignity and state

But finding our fraile life how euery day
It like a bubble vanisheth away

For this condition did mankinde detest
Farre more incertaine then that of the beast

Sure heauen doth hate this world and deadly too
Else as it hath done it would neuer doe

For if it did not , it would ne 're permit
A man of so much vertue , knowledge , wit

Of naturall goodnesse , supernaturall grace
Whose courses when considerately I trace

Into their ends , and diligently looke
They serue me for Oeconomike booke

By which this rough world I not onely stemme
In goodnesse but grow learn 'd by reading them

O pardon me , it my much sorrow is
Which makes me vse this long Parenthesis

Had heauen this world not hated as I say
In height of life it had not , tane away

A spirit so braue , so actiue , and so free
That such a one who would not wish to bee

Rather then weare a Crowne , by Armes though got
So fast a friend , so true a Patriot

In things concerning both the worlds so wise
Besides so liberall of his faculties

That where he would his industrie bestowe
He would haue done , e 're one could think to doe

No more talke of the working of the Starres
For plenty , scarcenesse , or for peace , or Warres

They are impostures , therefore get you hence
With all your Planets , and their influence

No more doe I care into them to looke
Then in some idle Chiromantick booke

Shewing the line of life , and _Venus_ mount
Nor yet no more would I of them account

Then what that tells me , since what that so ere
Might promise man long life : of care and feare

By nature freed , a conscience cleare , and quiet
His health , his constitution , and his diet

Counting a hundred , fourscore at the least
Propt vp by prayers , yet more to be encreast

All these should faile , and in his fiftieth yeare
He should expire , henceforth let none be deare

To me at all , lest for my haplesse sake
Before their time heauen from the world them take

And leaue me wretched to lament their ends
As I doe his , who was a thousand friends

Canst thou depart and be forgotten so
STANHOPE thou canst not , no deare STANHOPE , no

But in despight of death the world shall see
That Muse which so much graced was by thee

Can black Obliuion vtterly out-braue
And set thee vp aboue thy silent Graue

I meruail 'd much the _Derbian_ Nimphes were dumbe
Or of those Muses , what should be become

That of all those , the mountaines there among
Not one this while thy _Epicedium_sung

But so it is , when they of thee were reft
They all those hills , and all those Riuers left

And sullen growne , their former seates remoue
Both from cleare _Darwin_ , and from siluer _Doue_

And for thy losse , they greeued are so sore
That they haue vow 'd they will come there no more

But leaue thy losse to me , that I should rue thee
Vnhappy man , and yet I neuer knew thee

Me thou didst loue vnseene , so did I thee
It was our spirits that lou 'd then and not wee

Therefore without profanenesse I may call
The loue betwixt vs , loue spirituall

But that which thou affectedst was so true
As that thereby thee perfectly I knew

And now that spirit , which thou so lou'dst , still mine
Shall offer this a Sacrifice to thine

And reare this Trophe , which for thee shall last
When this most beastly Iron age is past

I am perswaded , whilst we two haue slept
Our soules haue met , and to each other wept

That destenie so strongly should forbid
Our bodies to conuerse as oft they did

For certainly refined spirits doe know
As doe the Angels , and doe here belowe

Take the fruition of that endlesse blisse
As those aboue doe , and what each one is

They see diuinely , and as those there doe
They know each others wills , so soules can too

About that dismall time , thy spirit hence flew
Mine much was troubled , but why , I not knew

In dull and sleepy sounds , it often left me
As of it selfe it ment to haue bereft me

I asked it what the cause was , of such woe
Or what it might be , that might vexe it so

But it was deafe , nor my demand would here
But when that ill newes came , to touch mine eare

I straightwayes found this watchfull sperit of mine
Troubled had bin to take it leaue of thine

For when fate found , what nature late had done
How much from heauen , she for the earth had won

By thy deare birth ; said , that it could not be
In so yong yeares , what it perceiu 'd in thee

But nature sure , had fram 'd thee long before
And as Rich Misers of their mighty store

Keepe the most precious longst , so from times past
She onely had reserued thee till the last

So did thy wisedome , not thy youth behold
And tooke thee hence , in thinking thou wast old

Thy shape and beauty often haue to me
Bin highly praysed , which I thought might be

Truely reported , for a spirit so braue
Which heauen to thee so bountifully gaue

Nature could not in recompence againe
In some rich lodging but to entertaine

Let not the world report then , that the Peake
Is but a rude place only vast and bleake

And nothing hath to boast of but her Lead
When she can say that happily she bred

Thee , and when she shall of her wonders tell
Wherein she doth all other Tracts excell

Let her account thee greatst , and still to time
Of all the rest , accord thee for the prime

My noble friend , you challenge me to write
To you in verse , and often you recite

My promise to you , and to send you newes
As 't is a thing I very seldome vse

And I must write of State , if to _Madrid_
A thing our Proclamations here forbid

And that word State such Latitude doth beare
As it may make me very well to feare

To write , nay speake at all , these let you know
Your power on me , yet not that I will showe

The loue I beare you , in that lofty height
So cleere expression , or such words of weight

As into _Spanish_ if they were translated
Might make the Poets of that Realme amated

Yet these my least were , but that you extort
These numbers from me , when I should report

In home-spunne prose , in good plaine honest words
The newes our wofull _England_ vs affords

The Muses here sit sad , and mute the while
A sort of swine vnseasonably defile

Those sacred springs , which from the by-clift hill
Dropt their pure _Nectar_ into euery quill

In this with State , I hope I doe not deale
This onely tends the Muses common-weale

What canst thou hope , or looke for from his pen
Who liues with beasts , though in the shapes of men

And what a poore few are we honest still
And dare to be so , when all the world is ill

I finde this age of our markt with this Fate
That honest men are still precipitate

Vnder base villaines , which till th ' earth can vent
This her last brood , and wholly hath them spent

Shall be so , then in reuolution shall
Vertue againe arise by vices fall

But that shall I not see , neither will I
Maintaine this , as one doth a Prophesie

That our King _Iames_ to _Rome_ shall surely goe
And from his chaire the _Pope_ shall ouerthrow

But O this world is so giuen vp to hell
That as the old Giants , which did once rebell

Against the Gods , so this now-liuing race
Dare sin , yet stand , and Ieere heauen in the face

But soft my Muse , and make a little stay
Surely thou art not rightly in thy way

To my good _Ieffrayes_ was not I about
To write , and see , I suddainely am out

This is pure _Satire_ , that thou speak'st , and I
Was first in hand to write an Elegie

To tell my countreys shame I not delight
But doe bemoane 't I am no _Democrite_

O God , though Vertue mightily doe grieue
For all this world , yet will I not beleeue

But that shees faire and louely , and that she
So to the period of the world shall be

Else had she beene forsaken ( sure ) of all
For that so many sundry mischiefes fall

Vpon her dayly , and so many take
Armes vp against her , as it well might make

Her to forsake her nature , and behind
To leaue no step for future time to find

As she had neuer beene , for he that now
Can doe her most disgrace , him they alow

The times chiefe Champion , and he is the man
The prize , and Palme that absolutely wanne

For where Kings Clossets her free seat hath bin
She neere the Lodge , not suffered is to Inne

For ignorance against her stands in state
Like some great porter at a Pallace gate

So dull and barbarous lately are we growne
And there are some this slauery that haue sowne

That for mans knowledge it enough doth make
If he can learne , to read an Almanacke

By whom that trash of _Amadis de Gaule_
Is held an author most authenticall

And things we haue like Noblemen that be
In little time , which I haue hope to see

Vpon their foot-clothes , as the streets they ride
To haue their hornebookes at their girdles tied

But all their superfluity of spite
On vertues hand-maid Poesy doth light

And to extirpe her all their plots they lay
But to her ruine they shall misse the way

For his alone the Monuments of wit
Aboue the rage of Tyrants that doe sit

And from their strength , not one himselfe can saue
But they shall tryumph o ' r his hated graue

In my conceipt , friend , thou didst neuer see
A righter Madman then thou hast of me

For now as _Elegiack_ I bewaile
These poor base times ; then suddainely I raile

And am _Satirick_ , not that I inforce
My selfe to be so , but euen as remorse

Or hate , in the proud fulnesse of their hight
Master my fancy , iust so doe I write

But gentle friend as soone shall I behold
That stone of which so many haue vs tould

( Yet neuer any to this day could make
The great _Elixar_ or to vndertake

The _Rose-crosse_ knowledge which is much like that
A Tarrying-iron for fooles to labour at

As euer after I may hope to see
( A plague vpon this beastly world for me

Wit so respected as it was of yore
And if hereafter any it restore

It must be those that yet for many a yeare
Shall be vnborne that must inhabit here

And such in vertue as shall be ashamed
Almost to heare their ignorant Grandsires named

With whom so many noble spirits then liued
That were by them of all reward depriued

My noble friend , I would I might haue quit
This age of these , and that I might haue writ

Before all other , how much the braue pen
Had here bin honoured of the _English_ men

Goodnesse and knowledge , held by them in prise
How hatefull to them Ignorance and vice

But it falls out the contrary is true
And so my _Ieffreyes_ for this time adue

Accursed Death , what neede was there at all
Of thee , or who to councell thee did call

The subiect whereupon these lines I spend
For thee was most vnfit , her timelesse end

Too soone thou wroughtst , too neere her thou didst stand
Thou shouldst haue lent thy leane and meager hand

To those who oft the help thereof beseech
And can be cured by no other Leech

In this wide world how many thousands be
That hauing past fourescore , doe call for thee

The wretched debtor in the Iayle that lies
Yet can not this his Creditor suffice

Doth woe thee oft with many a sigh and teare
Yet thou art coy , and him thou wilt not heare

The Captiue slaue that tuggeth at the Oares
And vnderneath the Bulls tough sinewes rores

Begs at thy hand , in lieu of all his paines
That thou wouldst but release him of his chaines

Yet thou a niggard listenest not thereto
With one short gaspe which thou mightst easily do

But thou couldst come to her ere there was neede
And euen at once destroy both flower and seede

But cruell Death if thou so barbarous be
To those so goodly , and so young as shee

That in their teeming thou wilt shew thy spight
Either from marriage thou wilt Maides affright

Or in their wedlock , Widowes liues to chuse
Their Husbands bed , and vtterly refuse

Fearing conception ; so shalt thou thereby
Extirpate mankinde by thy cruelty

If after direfull Tragedy thou thirst
Extinguish _Himens_ Torches at the first

Build Funerall pyles , and the sad pauement strewe
With mournfull Cypresse , and the pale-leau 'd Yewe

Away with Roses , Myrtle , and with Bayes
Ensignes of mirth , and iollity , as these

Neuer at Nuptials vsed be againe
But from the Church the new Bride entertaine

With weeping _Nenias_ , euer and among
As at departings be sad _Requiems_ song

_Lucina_ by th ' olde Poets that wert sayd
Women in Childe-birth euermore to ayde

Because thine Altars , long haue layne neglected
Nor as they should , thy holy fiers reflected

Vpon thy Temples , therefore thou doest flye
And wilt not helpe them in necessitie

Thinking vpon thee , I doe often muse
Whether for thy deare sake I should accuse

In days of old , there lived , of mighty fame
A valiant prince , and Theseus was his name

A chief , who more in feats of arms excelled
The rising nor the setting sun beheld

Of Athens he was lord ; much land he won
And added foreign countries to his crown

In Scythia with the warrior queen he strove
Whom first by force he conquer 'd , then by love

He brought in triumph back the beauteous dame
With whom her sister , fair Emilia , came

With honour to his home let Theseus ride
With love to friend , and fortune for his guide

I pass their warlike pomp , their proud array
Their shouts , their songs , their welcome on the way

The town besieged , and how much blood it cost
The female army , and the Athenian host

The spousals of Hippolita the queen
What tilts and tourneys at the feast were seen

The storm at their return , the ladies ' fear
But these , and other things , I must forbear

The field is spacious I design to sow
With oxen far unfit to draw the plough

The remnant of my tale is of a length
To tire your patience , and to waste my strength

And trivial accidents shall be forborne
That others may have time to take their turn

As was at first enjoin 'd us by mine host
That he whose tale is best , and pleases most

And therefore where I left , I will pursue
This ancient story , whether false or true

The prince I mention 'd , full of high renown
In this array drew near the Athenian town

When in his pomp and utmost of his pride
Marching he chanced to cast his eye aside

And saw a choir of mourning dames , who lay
By two and two across the common way

At his approach they raised a rueful cry
And beat their breasts , and held their hands on high

Creeping and crying , till they seized at last
His courser 's bridle , and his feet embraced

Tell me , said Theseus , what and whence you are
And why this funeral pageant you prepare

Is this the welcome of my worthy deeds
To meet my triumph in ill-omen 'd weeds

Or envy you my praise , and would destroy
With grief my pleasures , and pollute my joy

Or are you injured , and demand relief
Name your request , and I will ease your grief

The most in years of all the mourning train
Began ; but swooned first away for pain

Then scarce recover 'd spoke : Nor envy we
Thy great renown , nor grudge thy victory

'T is thine , O king , the afflicted to redress
And fame has fill 'd the world with thy success

We wretched women sue for that alone
Which of thy goodness is refused to none

Let fall some drops of pity on our grief
If what we beg be just , and we deserve relief

For none of us , who now thy grace implore
But held the rank of sovereign queen before

Till , thanks to giddy chance , which never bears
That mortal bliss should last for length of years

She cast us headlong from our high estate
And here in hope of thy return we wait

And long have waited in the temple nigh
Built to the gracious goddess Clemency

But reverence thou the Power whose name it bears
Relieve the oppress 'd , and wipe the widow 's tears

I , wretched I , have other fortune seen
The wife of Capaneus , and once a queen

At Thebes he fell ; cursed be the fatal day
And all the rest thou seest in this array

To make their moan , their lords in battle lost
Before that town besieged by our confederate host

But Creon , old and impious , who commands
The Theban city , and usurps the lands

Denies the rites of funeral fires to those
Whose breathless bodies yet he calls his foes

Unburn 'd , unburied , on a heap they lie
Such is their fate , and such his tyranny

No friend has leave to bear away the dead
But with their lifeless limbs his hounds are fed

At this she shriek 'd aloud ; the mournful train
Echoed her grief , and grovelling on the plain

With groans , and hands upheld , to move his mind
Besought his pity to their helpless kind

The prince was touch 'd , his tears began to flow
And , as his tender heart would break in two

He sigh 'd , and could not but their fate deplore
So wretched now , so fortunate before

Then lightly from his lofty steed he flew
And , raising one by one the suppliant crew

To comfort each full solemnly he swore
That by the faith which knights to knighthood bore

And whate'er else to chivalry belongs
He would not cease , till he revenged their wrongs

That Greece should see perform 'd what he declared
And cruel Creon find his just reward

He said no more , but , shunning all delay
Rode on ; nor enter 'd Athens on his way

But left his sister and his queen behind
And waved his royal banner in the wind

Where in an argent field the god of war
Was drawn triumphant on his iron car

Red was his sword , and shield , and whole attire
And all the godhead seem 'd to glow with fire

Even the ground glitter 'd where the standard flew
And the green grass was dyed to sanguine hue

High on his pointed lance his pennon bore
His Cretan fight , the conquer 'd Minotaur

The soldiers shout around with generous rage
And in that victory their own presage

He praised their ardour : inly pleased to see
His host the flower of Grecian chivalry

All day he march 'd , and all the ensuing night
And saw the city with returning light

The process of the war I need not tell
How Theseus conquer 'd , and how Creon fell

Or after , how by storm the walls were won
Or how the victor sack 'd and burn 'd the town

How to the ladies he restored again
The bodies of their lords in battle slain

And with what ancient rites they were interred
All these to fitter times shall be deferred

I spare the widows ' tears , their woeful cries
And howling at their husbands ' obsequies

How Theseus at these funerals did assist
And with what gifts the mourning dames dismissed

Thus when the victor chief had Creon slain
And conquer 'd Thebes , he pitch 'd upon the plain

His mighty camp , and , when the day returned
The country wasted , and the hamlets burned

And left the pillagers , to rapine bred
Without control to strip and spoil the dead

There , in a heap of slain , among the rest
Two youthful knights they found beneath a load oppressed

Of slaughter 'd foes , whom first to death they sent
The trophies of their strength , a bloody monument

Both fair , and both of royal blood they seemed
Whom kinsmen to the crown the heralds deemed

That day in equal arms they fought for fame
Their swords , their shields , their surcoats were the same

Close by each other laid , they press 'd the ground
Their manly bosoms pierced with many a grisly wound

Nor well alive , nor wholly dead they were
But some faint signs of feeble life appear

The wandering breath was on the wing to part
Weak was the pulse , and hardly heaved the heart

These two were sisters ' sons ; and Arcite one
Much famed in fields , with valiant Palamon

From these their costly arms the spoilers rent
And softly both convey 'd to Theseus ' tent

Whom , known of Creon 's line , and cured with care
He to his city sent as prisoners of the war

Hopeless of ransom , and condemn 'd to lie
In durance , doom 'd a lingering death to die

This done , he march 'd away with warlike sound
And to his Athens turn 'd , with laurels crowned

But in a tower , and never to be loosed
The woful captive kinsmen are enclosed

Thus year by year they pass , and day by day
Till once , 't was on the morn of cheerful May

The young Emilia , fairer to be seen
Than the fair lily on the flowery green

More fresh than May herself in blossoms new
For with the rosy colour strove her hue

Waked , as her custom was , before the day
To do the observance due to sprightly May

For sprightly May commands our youth to keep
The vigils of her night , and breaks their sluggard sleep

Each gentle breast with kindly warmth she moves
Inspires new flames , revives extinguish 'd loves

In this remembrance , Emily , ere day
Arose , and dress 'd herself in rich array

Fresh as the month , and as the morning fair
Adown her shoulders fell her length of hair

A riband did the braided tresses bind
The rest was loose and wanton 'd in the wind

Aurora had but newly chased the night
And purpled o'er the sky with blushing light

When to the garden walk she took her way
To sport and trip along in cool of day

At every turn , she made a little stand
And thrust among the thorns her lily hand

To draw the rose , and every rose she drew
She shook the stalk , and brush 'd away the dew

Then party-colour 'd flowers of white and red
She wove , to make a garland for her head

This done , she sung and caroll 'd out so clear
That men and angels might rejoice to hear

Even wondering Philomel forgot to sing
And learn 'd from her to welcome in the spring

The tower , of which before was mention made
Within whose keep the captive knights were laid

Built of a large extent , and strong withal
Was one partition of the palace wall

The garden was enclosed within the square
Where young Emilia took the morning air

It happen 'd Palamon , the prisoner knight
Restless for woe , arose before the light

And with his jailer 's leave desired to breathe
An air more wholesome than the damps beneath

This granted , to the tower he took his way
Cheer 'd with the promise of a glorious day

Then cast a languishing regard around
And saw , with hateful eyes , the temples crowned

He sigh 'd , and turn 'd his eyes , because he knew
'T was but a larger jail he had in view

Then look 'd below , and from the castle 's height
Beheld a nearer and more pleasing sight

The garden , which before he had not seen
In spring 's new livery clad of white and green

This view 'd , but not enjoy 'd , with arms across
He stood , reflecting on his country 's loss

Himself an object of the public scorn
And often wish 'd he never had been born

At last , for so his destiny required
With walking giddy , and with thinking tired

He through a little window cast his sight
Though thick of bars , that gave a scanty light

But even that glimmering served him to descry
The inevitable charms of Emily

Scarce had he seen , but seized with sudden smart
Stung to the quick , he felt it at his heart

Struck blind with overpowering light he stood
Then started back amazed , and cried aloud

Young Arcite heard ; and up he ran with haste
To help his friend , and in his arms embraced

And ask 'd him why he look 'd so deadly wan
And whence and how his change of cheer began

Or who had done the offence ? But if , said he
Your grief alone is hard captivity

For love of Heaven , with patience undergo
A cureless ill , since Fate will have it so

So stood our horoscope in chains to lie
And Saturn in the dungeon of the sky

Or other baleful aspect , ruled our birth
When all the friendly stars were under earth

Whate'er betides , by Destiny 't is done
And better bear like men , than vainly seek to shun

Nor of my bonds , said Palamon again
Nor of unhappy planets I complain

But when my mortal anguish caused my cry
That moment I was hurt through either eye

Pierced with a random shaft , I faint away
And perish with insensible decay

A glance of some new goddess gave the wound
Whom , like Actaeon , unaware I found

Look how she walks along yon shady space
Not Juno moves with more majestic grace

If thou art Venus ( for thy charms confess
That face was form 'd in heaven , nor art thou less

Disguised in habit , undisguised in shape
Oh , help us captives from our chains to 'scape

But if our doom be past in bonds to lie
For life , and in a loathsome dungeon die

Then be thy wrath appeased with our disgrace
And show compassion to the Theban race

Oppress 'd by tyrant power ! While yet he spoke
Arcite on Emily had fix 'd his look

The fatal dart a ready passage found
And deep within his heart infix 'd the wound

So that if Palamon were wounded sore
Arcite was hurt as much as he , or more

Then from his inmost soul he sigh 'd , and said
The beauty I behold has struck me dead

Unknowingly she strikes ; and kills by chance
Poison is in her eyes , and death in every glance

Oh , I must ask ; nor ask alone , but move
Her mind to mercy , or must die for love

Thus Arcite : and thus Palamon replies
( Eager his tone and ardent were his eyes

Speak'st thou in earnest , or in jesting vein
Jesting , said Arcite , suits but ill with pain

And bent his brows ) with men who honour weigh
Their faith to break , their friendship to betray

But worst with thee , of noble lineage born
My kinsman , and in arms my brother sworn

Have we not plighted each our holy oath
That one should be the common good of both

One soul should both inspire , and neither prove
His fellow 's hindrance in pursuit of love

To this before the gods we gave our hands
And nothing but our death can break the bands

This binds thee , then , to further my design
As I am bound by vow to further thine

Nor canst , nor dar'st thou , traitor , on the plain
Appeach my honour , or thine own maintain

Since thou art of my council , and the friend
Whose faith I trust , and on whose care depend

And would'st thou court my lady 's love , which I
Much rather than release would choose to die

But thou , false Arcite , never shall obtain
Thy bad pretence ; I told thee first my pain

For first my love began ere thine was born
Thou as my council , and my brother sworn

Art bound to assist my eldership of right
Or justly to be deem 'd a perjured knight

Thus Palamon : but Arcite with disdain
In haughty language thus replied again

Forsworn thyself : the traitor 's odious name
I first return , and then disprove thy claim

If love be passion , and that passion nursed
With strong desires , I loved the lady first

Canst thou pretend desire , whom zeal inflamed
To worship , and a power celestial named

Thine was devotion to the blest above
I saw the woman and desired her love

First own 'd my passion , and to thee commend
The important secret , as my chosen friend

Suppose ( which yet I grant not ) thy desire
A moment elder than my rival fire

Can chance of seeing first thy title prove
And know'st thou not , no law is made for love

Law is to things which to free choice relate
Love is not in our choice , but in our fate

Laws are but positive ; love 's power , we see
Is Nature 's sanction , and her first decree

Each day we break the bond of human laws
For love , and vindicate the common cause

Laws for defence of civil rights are placed
Love throws the fences down , and makes a general waste

Maids , widows , wives , without distinction fall
The sweeping deluge , love , comes on , and covers all

If , then , the laws of friendship I transgress
I keep the greater , while I break the less

Both hopeless to be ransom 'd , never more
To see the sun , but as he passes o'er

Like AEsop 's hounds contending for the bone
Each pleaded right , and would be lord alone

The fruitless fight continued all the day
A cur came by , and snatch 'd the prize away

As courtiers , therefore , jostle for a grant
And when they break their friendship , plead their want

So thou , if fortune will thy suit advance
Love on , nor envy me my equal chance

For I must love , and am resolved to try
My fate , or , failing in the adventure , die

Great was their strife , which hourly was renewed
Till each with mortal hate his rival viewed

Now friends no more , nor walking hand in hand
But when they met , they made a surly stand

And glared like angry lions as they passed
And wish 'd that every look might be their last

It chanced at length , Pirithous came to attend
This worthy Theseus , his familiar friend

Their love in early infancy began
And rose as childhood ripen 'd into man

Companions of the war ; and loved so well
That when one died , as ancient stories tell

But to pursue my tale ; to welcome home
His warlike brother is Pirithous come

Arcite of Thebes was known in arms long since
And honour 'd by this young Thessalian prince

Theseus , to gratify his friend and guest
Who made our Arcite 's freedom his request

Restored to liberty the captive knight
But on these hard conditions I recite

That if hereafter Arcite should be found
Within the compass of Athenian ground

By day or night , or on whate'er pretence
His head should pay the forfeit of the offence

To this Pirithous for his friend agreed
And on his promise was the prisoner freed

Unpleased and pensive hence he takes his way
At his own peril ; for his life must pay

Who now but Arcite mourns his bitter fate
Finds his dear purchase , and repents too late

What have I gain 'd , he said , in prison pent
If I but change my bonds for banishment

And banish 'd from her sight , I suffer more
In freedom than I felt in bonds before

Forced from her presence , and condemn 'd to live
Unwelcome freedom , and unthank 'd reprieve

Heaven is not , but where Emily abides
And where she 's absent , all is hell besides

Next to my day of birth , was that accursed
Which bound my friendship to Pirithous first

Had I not known that prince , I still had been
In bondage , and had still Emilia seen

For though I never can her grace deserve
'T is recompence enough to see and serve

O Palamon , my kinsman and my friend
How much more happy fates thy love attend

Thine is the adventure ; thine the victory
Well has thy fortune turn 'd the dice for thee

Thou on that angel 's face may'st feed thine eyes
In prison , no ; but blissful paradise

Thou daily seest that sun of beauty shine
And lovest at least in love 's extremest line

I mourn in absence , love 's eternal night
And who can tell but since thou hast her sight

Fortune ( a various power ) may cease to frown
And by some ways unknown thy wishes crown

But I , the most forlorn of human kind
Nor help can hope , nor remedy can find

But doom 'd to drag my loathsome life in care
For my reward , must end it in despair

Fire , water , air , and earth , and force of fates
That governs all , and Heaven that all creates

Nor art , nor nature 's hand can ease my grief
Nothing but death , the wretch 's last relief

Then farewell youth , and all the joys that dwell
With youth and life , and life itself farewell

But why , alas ! do mortal men in vain
Of fortune , fate , or Providence complain

God gives us what he knows our wants require
And better things than those which we desire

Some pray for riches ; riches they obtain
But , watch 'd by robbers , for their wealth are slain

Some pray from prison to be freed ; and come
When guilty of their vows , to fall at home

Murder 'd by those they trusted with their life
A favour 'd servant , or a bosom wife

Such dear-bought blessings happen every day
Because we know not for what things to pray

Like drunken sots about the street we roam
Well knows the sot he has a certain home

Yet knows not how to find the uncertain place
And blunders on , and staggers every pace

Thus all seek happiness ; but few can find
For far the greater part of men are blind

This is my case , who thought our utmost good
Was in one word of freedom understood

The fatal blessing came : from prison free
I starve abroad , and lose the sight of Emily

Thus Arcite ; but if Arcite thus deplore
His sufferings , Palamon yet suffers more

For when he knew his rival freed and gone
He swells with wrath ; he makes outrageous moan

He frets , he fumes , he stares , he stamps the ground
The hollow tower with clamours rings around

With briny tears he bathed his fetter 'd feet
And dropp 'd all o'er with agony of sweat

Alas ! he cried , I wretch in prison pine
Too happy rival , while the fruit is thine

Thou livest at large , thou draw'st thy native air
Pleased with thy freedom , proud of my despair

Thou may'st , since thou hast youth and courage joined
A sweet behaviour and a solid mind

Assemble ours , and all the Theban race
To vindicate on Athens thy disgrace

And after , by some treaty made , possess
Fair Emily , the pledge of lasting peace

So thine shall be the beauteous prize , while I
Must languish in despair , in prison die

Thus all the advantage of the strife is thine
Thy portion double joys , and double sorrows mine

The rage of jealousy then fired his soul
And his face kindled like a burning coal

Now cold despair , succeeding in her stead
To livid paleness turns the glowing red

His blood , scarce liquid , creeps within his veins
Like water which the freezing wind constrains

Then thus he said : Eternal Deities
Who rule the world with absolute decrees

And write whatever time shall bring to pass
With pens of adamant on plates of brass

What ! is the race of human kind your care
Beyond what all his fellow-creatures are

He with the rest is liable to pain
And like the sheep , his brother-beast , is slain

Cold , hunger , prisons , ills without a cure
All these he must , and guiltless , oft endure

Or does your justice , power , or prescience fail
When the good suffer , and the bad prevail

What worse to wretched virtue could befall
If fate or giddy fortune govern 'd all

Nay , worse than other beasts is our estate
Them , to pursue their pleasures , you create

We , bound by harder laws , must curb our will
And your commands , not our desires , fulfil

Then when the creature is unjustly slain
Yet after death , at least , he feels no pain

But man , in life surcharged with woe before
Not freed when dead , is doom 'd to suffer more

A serpent shoots his sting at unaware
An ambush 'd thief forelays a traveller

The man lies murder 'd , while the thief and snake
One gains the thickets , and one threads the brake

This let divines decide ; but well I know
Just , or unjust , I have my share of woe

Through Saturn seated in a luckless place
And Juno 's wrath , that persecutes my race

Or Mars and Venus , in a quartile , move
My pangs of jealousy for Arcite 's love

Let Palamon oppress 'd in bondage mourn
While to his exiled rival we return

By this , the sun , declining from his height
The day had shorten 'd to prolong the night

The lengthen 'd night gave length of misery
Both to the captive lover and the free

For Palamon in endless prison mourns
And Arcite forfeits life if he returns

The banish 'd never hopes his love to see
Nor hopes the captive lord his liberty

'T is hard to say who suffers greater pains
One sees his love , but can not break his chains

One free , and all his motions uncontrolled
Beholds whate'er he would , but what he would behold

Judge as you please , for I will haste to tell
What fortune to the banish 'd knight befell

When Arcite was to Thebes return 'd again
The loss of her he loved renew 'd his pain

What could be worse , than never more to see
His life , his soul , his charming Emily

He raved with all the madness of despair
He roar 'd , he beat his breast , he tore his hair

Dry sorrow in his stupid eyes appears
For , wanting nourishment , he wanted tears

His eye-balls in their hollow sockets sink
Bereft of sleep , he loathes his meat and drink

He withers at his heart , and looks as wan
As the pale spectre of a murder 'd man

That pale turns yellow , and his face receives
The faded hue of sapless boxen leaves

In solitary groves he makes his moan
Walks early out , and ever is alone

Nor , mix 'd in mirth , in youthful pleasures shares
But sighs when songs and instruments he hears

His spirits are so low , his voice is drowned
He hears as from afar , or in a swound

Uncomb 'd his locks and squalid his attire
Unlike the trim of love and gay desire

But full of museful mopings , which presage
The loss of reason , and conclude in rage

This when he had endured a year and more
Now wholly changed from what he was before

It happen 'd once , that , slumbering as he lay
He dream 'd ( his dream began at break of day

That Hermes o'er his head in air appeared
And with soft words his drooping spirits cheered

His hat , adorn 'd with wings , disclosed the god
And in his hand he bore the sleep-compelling rod

Such as he seem 'd , when , at his sire 's command
On Argus ' head he laid the snaky wand

Arise , he said , to conquering Athens go
There fate appoints an end to all thy woe

The fright awaken 'd Arcite with a start
Against his bosom bounced his heaving heart

But soon he said , with scarce-recover 'd breath
And thither will I go , to meet my death

Sure to be slain ; but death is my desire
Since in Emilia 's sight I shall expire

By chance he spied a mirror while he spoke
And gazing there , beheld his alter 'd look

Wondering , he saw his features and his hue
So much were changed , that scarce himself he knew

A sudden thought then starting in his mind
Since I in Arcite can not Arcite find

The world may search in vain with all their eyes
But never penetrate through this disguise

Thanks to the change which grief and sickness give
In low estate I may securely live

And see unknown my mistress day by day
He said ; and clothed himself in coarse array

A labouring hind in show ; then forth he went
And to the Athenian towers his journey bent

One squire attended in the same disguise
Made conscious of his master 's enterprise

Arrived at Athens , soon he came to court
Unknown , unquestion 'd in that thick resort

Proffering for hire his service at the gate
To drudge , draw water , and to run or wait

So fair befell him , that for little gain
He served at first Emilia 's chamberlain

And , watchful all advantages to spy
Was still at hand , and in his master 's eye

And as his bones were big , and sinews strong
Refused no toil that could to slaves belong

But from deep wells with engines water drew
And used his noble hands the wood to hew

He pass 'd a year at least attending thus
On Emily , and call 'd Philostratus

But never was there man of his degree
So much esteem 'd , so well beloved as he

So gentle of condition was he known
That through the court his courtesy was blown

All think him worthy of a greater place
And recommend him to the royal grace

That , exercised within a higher sphere
His virtues more conspicuous might appear

Thus by the general voice was Arcite praised
And by great Theseus to high favour raised

Among his menial servants first enrolled
And largely entertain 'd with sums of gold

Besides what secretly from Thebes was sent
Of his own income , and his annual rent

This well employ 'd , he purchased friends and fame
But cautiously conceal 'd from whence it came

Thus for three years he lived with large increase
In arms of honour , and esteem in peace

To Theseus ' person he was ever near
And Theseus for his virtues held him dear

While Arcite lives in bliss , the story turns
Where hopeless Palamon in prison mourns

For six long years immured , the captive knight
Had dragg 'd his chains , and scarcely seen the light

Lost liberty and love at once he bore
His prison pain 'd him much , his passion more

Nor dares he hope his fetters to remove
Nor ever wishes to be free from love

But when the sixth revolving year was run
And May within the Twins received the sun

Were it by chance , or forceful destiny
Which forms in causes first whate'er shall be

Assisted by a friend , one moonless night
This Palamon from prison took his flight

A pleasant beverage he prepared before
Of wine and honey , mix 'd with added store

Of opium ; to his keeper this he brought
Who swallow 'd unaware the sleepy draught

And snored secure till morn , his senses bound
In slumber , and in long oblivion drowned

Short was the night , and careful Palamon
Sought the next covert e'er the rising sun

A thick-spread forest near the city lay
To this with lengthen 'd strides he took his way

Safe from pursuit , he meant to shun the light
Till the brown shadows of the friendly night

When to his country come , his next design
Was all the Theban race in arms to join

And war on Theseus , till he lost his life
Or won the beauteous Emily to wife

Thus while his thoughts the lingering day beguile
To gentle Arcite let us turn our style

Who little dreamt how nigh he was to care
Till treacherous fortune caught him in the snare

The morning lark , the messenger of day
Saluted in her song the morning gray

And soon the sun arose with beams so bright
That all the horizon laugh 'd to see the joyous sight

He with his tepid rays the rose renews
And licks the drooping leaves , and dries the dews

When Arcite left his bed , resolved to pay
Observance to the month of merry May

Forth on his fiery steed betimes he rode
That scarcely prints the turf on which he trode

At ease he seem 'd , and , prancing o'er the plains
Turn 'd only to the grove his horse 's reins

The grove I named before ; and , lighted there
A woodbine garland sought to crown his hair

Then turn 'd his face against the rising day
And raised his voice to welcome in the May

For thee , sweet month ! the groves green liveries wear
If not the first , the fairest of the year

For thee the Graces lead the dancing hours
And Nature 's ready pencil paints the flowers

When thy short reign is past , the feverish sun
The sultry tropic fears , and moves more slowly on

So may thy tender blossoms fear no blight
Nor goats with venom 'd teeth thy tendrils bite

As thou shalt guide my wandering feet to find
The fragrant greens I seek , my brows to bind

His vows address 'd , within the grove he strayed
Till Fate , or Fortune , near the place conveyed

Full little thought of him the gentle knight
Who , flying death , had there conceal 'd his flight

And less he knew him for his hated foe
But fear 'd him as a man he did not know

But as it has been said of ancient years
That fields are full of eyes , and woods have ears

For this the wise are ever on their guard
For , unforeseen , they say , is unprepared

Uncautious Arcite thought himself alone
And less than all suspected Palamon

Who , listening , heard him , while he search 'd the grove
And loudly sung his roundelay of love

But on the sudden stopp 'd , and silent stood
As lovers often muse , and change their mood

Now high as heaven , and then as low as hell
Now up , now down , as buckets in a well

For Venus , like her day , will change her cheer
And seldom shall we see a Friday clear

Thus Arcite having sung , with alter 'd hue
Sunk on the ground , and from his bosom drew

A desperate sigh , accusing Heaven and Fate
And angry Juno 's unrelenting hate

Cursed be the day when first I did appear
Let it be blotted from the calendar

Still will the jealous queen pursue our race
Cadmus is dead , the Theban city was

Yet ceases not her hate : for all who come
From Cadmus are involved in Cadmus ' doom

I suffer for my blood : unjust decree
That punishes another 's crime on me

In mean estate I serve my mortal foe
The man who caused my country 's overthrow

This is not all ; for Juno , to my shame
Has forced me to forsake my former name

That side of heaven is all my enemy
Mars ruin 'd Thebes : his mother ruin 'd me

Of all the royal race remains but one
Besides myself , the unhappy Palamon

Whom Theseus holds in bonds , and will not free
Without a crime , except his kin to me

Yet these , and all the rest , I could endure
But love 's a malady without a cure

Fierce love has pierced me with his fiery dart
He fires within , and hisses at my heart

Your eyes , fair Emily , my fate pursue
I suffer for the rest , I die for you

Of such a goddess no time leaves record
Who burn 'd the temple where she was adored

And let it burn , I never will complain
Pleased with my sufferings , if you knew my pain

At this a sickly qualm his heart assailed
His ears ring inward , and his senses failed

No word miss 'd Palamon of all he spoke
But soon to deadly pale he changed his look

He trembled every limb , and felt a smart
As if cold steel had glided through his heart

No longer staid , but starting from his place
Discover 'd stood , and show 'd his hostile face

False traitor , Arcite ! traitor to thy blood
Bound by thy sacred oath to seek my good

Now art thou found forsworn , for Emily
And darest attempt her love , for whom I die

So hast thou cheated Theseus with a wile
Against thy vow , returning to beguile

Under a borrow 'd name : as false to me
So false thou art to him who set thee free

But rest assured , that either thou shalt die
Or else renounce thy claim in Emily

For though unarm 'd I am , and ( freed by chance
Am here without my sword , or pointed lance

Hope not , base man , unquestioned hence to go
For I am Palamon , thy mortal foe

Arcite , who heard his tale , and knew the man
His sword unsheath 'd , and fiercely thus began

Now by the gods who govern heaven above
Wert thou not weak with hunger , mad with love

That word had been thy last , or in this grove
This hand should force thee to renounce thy love

The surety which I gave thee , I defy
Fool , not to know that love endures no tie

Know I will serve the fair in thy despite
But since thou art my kinsman , and a knight

Here , have my faith , to-morrow in this grove
Our arms shall plead the titles of our love

And Heaven so help my right , as I alone
Will come , and keep the cause and quarrel both unknown

With arms of proof both for myself and thee
Choose thou the best , and leave the worst to me

And , that at better ease thou may'st abide
Bedding and clothes I will this night provide

And needful sustenance , that thou may'st be
A conquest better won , and worthy me

His promise Palamon accepts ; but prayed
To keep it better than the first he made

Thus fair they parted till the morrow 's dawn
For each had laid his plighted faith to pawn

Oh , Love ! thou sternly dost thy power maintain
And wilt not bear a rival in thy reign

This was in Arcite proved , and Palamon
Both in despair , yet each would love alone

Arcite return 'd , and , as in honour tied
His foe with bedding , and with food supplied

Then , ere the day , two suits of armour sought
Which , borne before him on his steed , he brought

Both were of shining steel , and wrought so pure
As might the strokes of two such arms endure

Now , at the time , and in the appointed place
The challenger and challenged , face to face

Approach ; each other from afar they knew
And from afar their hatred changed their hue

So stands the Thracian herdsman with his spear
Pull in the gap , and hopes the hunted bear

And hears him rustling in the wood , and sees
His course at distance by the bending trees

And thinks , Here comes my mortal enemy
And either he must fall in fight , or I

This while he thinks , he lifts aloft his dart
A generous chilness seizes every part

Thus pale they meet ; their eyes with fury burn
None greets ; for none the greeting will return

But in dumb surliness , each arm 'd with care
His foe profess 'd , as brother of the war

Then both , no moment lost , at once advance
Against each other , arm 'd with sword and lance

They lash , they foin , they pass , they strive to bore
Their corslets and the thinnest parts explore

Thus two long hours in equal arms they stood
And wounded , wound , till both were bathed in blood

And not a foot of ground had either got
As if the world depended on the spot

Fell Arcite like an angry tiger fared
And like a lion Palamon appeared

Or , as two boars , whom love to battle draws
With rising bristles , and with frothy jaws

Their adverse breasts with tusks oblique they wound
With grunts and groans the forest rings around

So fought the knights , and fighting must abide
Till fate an umpire sends their difference to decide

The power that ministers to God 's decrees
And executes on earth what Heaven foresees

Call 'd providence , or chance , or fatal sway
Comes with resistless force , and finds or makes her way

Nor kings , nor nations , nor united power
One moment can retard the appointed hour

And some one day , some wondrous chance appears
Which happen 'd not in centuries of years

For sure , whate'er we mortals hate , or love
Or hope , or fear , depends on Powers above

They move our appetites to good or ill
And by foresight necessitate the will

In Theseus this appears ; whose youthful joy
Was beasts of chase in forests to destroy

This gentle knight , inspired by jolly May
Forsook his easy couch at early day

Beside him rode Hippolita the queen
And Emily attired in lively green

With horns , and hounds , and all the tuneful cry
To hunt a royal hart within the covert nigh

And as he follow 'd Mars before , so now
He serves the goddess of the silver bow

The way that Theseus took was to the wood
Where the two knights in cruel battle stood

The lawn on which they fought , the appointed place
In which the uncoupled hounds began the chase

Thither forth-right he rode to rouse the prey
That , shaded by the fern , in harbour lay

And thence dislodged , was wont to leave the wood
For open fields , and cross the crystal flood

Approach 'd , and looking underneath the sun
He saw proud Arcite , and fierce Palamon

In mortal battle doubling blow on blow
Like lightning flamed their falchions to and fro

And shot a dreadful gleam ; so strong they strook
There seem 'd less force required to fell an oak

He gazed with wonder on their equal might
Look 'd eager on , but knew not either knight

Resolved to learn , he spurr 'd his fiery steed
With goring rowels to provoke his speed

The minute ended that began the race
So soon he was betwixt them on the place

And , with his sword unsheath 'd , on pain of life
Commands both combatants to cease their strife

Then with imperious tone pursues his threat
What are you ? why in arms together met

How dares your pride presume against my laws
As in a listed field to fight your cause

Unask 'd the royal grant ; no marshal by
As knightly rites require ; nor judge to try

Then Palamon , with scarce recover 'd breath
Thus hasty spoke : We both deserve the death

And both would die ; for look the world around
A pair so wretched is not to be found

Our life 's a load ; encumber 'd with the charge
We long to set the imprison 'd soul at large

Now , as thou art a sovereign judge , decree
The rightful doom of death to him and me

Me first , oh , kill me first , and cure my woe
Then sheath the sword of justice on my foe

Or kill him first ; for when his name is heard
He foremost will receive his due reward

Arcite of Thebes is he ; thy mortal foe
On whom thy grace did liberty bestow

But first contracted , that if ever found
By day or night upon the Athenian ground

His head should pay the forfeit ; see returned
The perjured knight , his oath and honour scorned

For this is he , who , with a borrow 'd name
And proffer 'd service , to thy palace came

Now call 'd Philostratus : retain 'd by thee
A traitor trusted , and in high degree

My part remains ; from Thebes my birth I own
And call myself the unhappy Palamon

Think me not like that man ; since no disgrace
Can force me to renounce the honour of my race

Know me for what I am : I broke my chain
Nor promised I thy prisoner to remain

The love of liberty with life is given
And life itself the inferior gift of Heaven

Thus without crime I fled ; but further know
I , with this Arcite , am thy mortal foe

Then give me death , since I thy life pursue
For safeguard of thyself , death is my due

More would'st thou know ? I love bright Emily
And , for her sake , and in her sight will die

But kill my rival too ; for he no less
Deserves ; and I thy righteous doom will bless

To this replied the stern Athenian prince
And sourly smiled : In owning your offence

You judge yourself ; and I but keep record
In place of law , while you pronounce the word

Take your desert , the death you have decreed
I seal your doom , and ratify the deed

By Mars , the patron of my arms , you die
He said ; dumb sorrow seized the standers-by

The queen above the rest , by nature good
( The pattern form 'd of perfect womanhood

For tender pity wept : when she began
Through the bright quire the infectious virtue ran

All dropt their tears , even the contended maid
And thus among themselves they softly said

What eyes can suffer this unworthy sight
Two youths of royal blood , renown 'd in fight

The mastership of Heaven in face and mind
And lovers , far beyond their faithless kind

See their wide streaming wounds ; they neither came
For pride of empire , nor desire of fame

Kings fight for kingdoms , madmen for applause
But love for love alone ; that crowns the lover 's cause

This thought , which ever bribes the beauteous kind
Such pity wrought in every lady 's mind

They left their steeds , and , prostrate on the place
From the fierce king implored the offenders ' grace

He paused a while , stood silent in his mood
( For yet his rage was boiling in his blood

But soon his tender mind the impression felt
( As softest metals are not slow to melt

And pity soonest runs in softest minds
Then reasons with himself ; and first he finds

His passion cast a mist before his sense
And either made , or magnified the offence

Offence ! of what ? to whom ? who judged the cause
The prisoner freed himself by nature 's laws

Born free , he sought his right : the man he freed
Was perjured , but his love excused the deed

Thus pondering , he look 'd under with his eyes
And saw the women 's tears , and heard their cries

Which moved compassion more ; he shook his head
And , softly sighing , to himself he said

Curse on the unpardoning prince , whom tears can draw
To no remorse ; who rules by lions ' law

And deaf to prayers , by no submission bowed
Rends all alike ; the penitent , and proud

At this , with look serene , he raised his head
Reason resumed her place , and passion fled

Then thus aloud he spoke : The power of love
In earth , and seas , and air , and heaven above

Rules , unresisted , with an awful nod
By daily miracles declared a god

He blinds the wise , gives eyesight to the blind
And moulds and stamps anew the lover 's mind

Behold that Arcite , and this Palamon
Freed from my fetters , and in safety gone

What hinder 'd either in their native soil
At ease to reap the harvest of their toil

But Love , their lord , did otherwise ordain
And brought them in their own despite again

To suffer death deserved ; for well they know
'T is in my power , and I their deadly foe

The proverb holds , that to be wise and love
Is hardly granted to the gods above

See how the madmen bleed ! behold the gains
With which their master , Love , rewards their pains

For seven long years , on duty every day
Lo , their obedience , and their monarch 's pay

Yet , as in duty bound , they serve him on
And , ask the fools , they think it wisely done

Nor ease , nor wealth , nor life itself regard
For 't is their maxim , Love is love 's reward

This is not all ; the fair , for whom they strove
Nor knew before , nor could suspect their love

Nor thought , when she beheld the sight from far
Her beauty was the occasion of the war

But sure a general doom on man is past
And all are fools and lovers , first or last

This both by others and myself I know
For I have served their sovereign long ago

Oft have been caught within the winding train
Of female snares , and felt the lover 's pain

To this remembrance , and the prayers of those
Who for the offending warriors interpose

I give their forfeit lives ; on this accord
To do me homage as their sovereign lord

And , as my vassals , to their utmost might
Assist my person , and assert my right

This freely sworn , the knights their grace obtained
Then thus the king his secret thoughts explained

If wealth , or honour , or a royal race
Or each , or all , may win a lady 's grace

Then either of you knights may well deserve
A princess born ; and such is she you serve

For Emily is sister to the crown
And but too well to both her beauty known

But should you combat till you both were dead
Two lovers can not share a single bed

As , therefore , both are equal in degree
The lot of both be left to destiny

Now hear the award , and happy may it prove
To her , and him who best deserves her love

Depart from hence in peace , and , free as air
Search the wide world , and where you please repair

But on the day when this returning sun
To the same point through every sign has run

Then each of you his hundred knights shall bring
In royal lists , to fight before the king

And then the knight , whom fate or happy chance
Shall with his friends to victory advance

And grace his arms so far in equal fight
From out the bars to force his opposite

Or kill , or make him recreant on the plain
The prize of valour and of love shall gain

The vanquish 'd party shall their claim release
And the long jars conclude in lasting peace

The charge be mine to adorn the chosen ground
The theatre of war , for champions so renowned

And take the patron 's place of either knight
With eyes impartial to behold the fight

If both are satisfied with this accord
Swear by the laws of knighthood on my sword

Who now but Palamon exults with joy
And ravish 'd Arcite seems to touch the sky

The whole assembled troop was pleased as well
Extol the award , and on their knees they fell

To bless the gracious king . The knights , with leave
Departing from the place , his last commands receive

On Emily with equal ardour look
And from her eyes their inspiration took

From thence to Thebes ' old walls pursue their way
Each to provide his champions for the day

It might be deem 'd , on our historian 's part
Or too much negligence , or want of art

If he forgot the vast magnificence
Of royal Theseus , and his large expense

He first enclosed for lists a level ground
The whole circumference a mile around

The form was circular ; and all without
A trench was sunk , to moat the place about

Within an amphitheatre appeared
Raised in degrees ; to sixty paces reared

That when a man was placed in one degree
Height was allow 'd for him above to see

Eastward was built a gate of marble white
The like adorn 'd the western opposite

A nobler object than this fabric was
Rome never saw ; nor of so vast a space

For rich with spoils of many a conquer 'd land
All arts and artists Theseus could command

Who sold for hire , or wrought for better fame
The master-painters , and the carvers came

So rose within the compass of the year
An age 's work , a glorious theatre

Then o'er its eastern gate was raised above
A temple , sacred to the Queen of Love

An altar stood below : on either hand
A priest with roses crown 'd , who held a myrtle wand

The dome of Mars was on the gate opposed
And on the north a turret was enclosed

Within the wall , of alabaster white
And crimson coral , for the Queen of Night

Within these oratories might you see
Rich carvings , portraitures , and imagery

Where every figure to the life expressed
The godhead 's power to whom it was addressed

In Venus ' temple on the sides were seen
The broken slumbers of enamour 'd men

Prayers that even spoke , and pity seem 'd to call
And issuing sighs that smoked along the wall

Complaints , and hot desires , the lover 's hell
And scalding tears that wore a channel where they fell

And all around were nuptial bonds , the ties
Of love 's assurance , and a train of lies

Beauty , and Youth , and Wealth , and Luxury
And spritely Hope , and short-enduring Joy

And Sorceries to raise the infernal powers
And Sigils framed in planetary hours

Expense , and After-Thought , and idle Care
And Doubts of motley hue , and dark Despair

Suspicious , and fantastical Surmise
And Jealousy suffused , with jaundice in her eyes

Discolouring all she view 'd , in tawny dressed
Down-look 'd , and with a cuckoo on her fist

Opposed to her , on the other side advance
The costly feast , the carol , and the dance

Minstrels and Music , Poetry and Play
And balls by night , and tournaments by day

All these were painted on the wall , and more
With acts and monuments of times before

And others added by prophetic doom
And lovers yet unborn , and loves to come

For there the Idalian mount , and Citheron
The court of Venus , was in colours drawn

Before the palace-gate , in careless dress
And loose array , sat portress Idleness

Medea 's charms were there , Circean feasts
With bowls that turn 'd enamour 'd youths to beasts

Here might be seen , that beauty , wealth , and wit
And prowess , to the power of love submit

The spreading snare for all mankind is laid
And lovers all betray , and are betrayed

The goddess self some noble hand had wrought
Smiling she seem 'd , and full of pleasing thought

From ocean as she first began to rise
And smooth 'd the ruffled seas and clear 'd the skies

She trode the brine , all bare below the breast
And the green waves but ill conceal 'd the rest

A lute she held ; and on her head was seen
A wreath of roses red , and myrtles green

Her turtles fann 'd the buxom air above
And , by his mother , stood an infant Love

With wings unfledged ; his eyes were banded o'er
His hands a bow , his back a quiver bore

But in the dome of mighty Mars the red
With different figures all the sides were spread

This temple , less in form , with equal grace
Was imitative of the first in Thrace

For that cold region was the loved abode
And sovereign mansion of the warrior god

The landscape was a forest wide and bare
Where neither beast , nor human kind repair

The fowl , that scent afar , the borders fly
And shun the bitter blast , and wheel about the sky

A cake of scurf lies baking on the ground
And prickly stubs , instead of trees , are found

Or woods , with knots and knares , deform 'd and old
Headless the most , and hideous to behold

A rattling tempest through the branches went
That stripp 'd them bare , and one sole way they bent

Heaven froze above , severe , the clouds congeal
And through the crystal vault appear 'd the standing hail

Such was the face without ; a mountain stood
Threatening from high , and overlook 'd the wood

Beneath the lowering brow , and on a bent
The temple stood of Mars armipotent

The frame of burnish 'd steel , that cast a glare
From far , and seem 'd to thaw the freezing air

A strait long entry to the temple led
Blind with high walls ; and horror over head

Thence issued such a blast , and hollow roar
As threaten 'd from the hinge to heave the door

In through that door , a northern light there shone
'T was all it had , for windows there were none

The gate was adamant ; eternal frame
Which , hew 'd by Mars himself , from Indian quarries came

The labour of a god ; and all along
Tough iron plates were clench 'd to make it strong

A tun about was every pillar there
A polish 'd mirror shone not half so clear

There saw I how the secret felon wrought
And treason labouring in the traitor 's thought

There the red Anger dared the pallid Fear
Next stood Hypocrisy , with holy leer

Soft smiling , and demurely looking down
But hid the dagger underneath the gown

The assassinating wife , the household fiend
And far the blackest there , the traitor-friend

On the other side , there stood Destruction bare
Unpunish 'd Rapine , and a waste of War

Contest , with sharpen 'd knives , in cloisters drawn
And all with blood bespread the holy lawn

Loud menaces were heard , and foul disgrace
And bawling infamy , in language base

The slayer of himself yet saw I there
The gore congeal 'd was clotted in his hair

With eyes half closed , and gaping mouth he lay
And grim , as when he breathed his sullen soul away

In midst of all the dome , Misfortune sate
And gloomy Discontent , and fell Debate

And Madness laughing in his ireful mood
And arm 'd complaint on theft ; and cries of blood

There was the murder 'd corpse in covert laid
And violent death in thousand shapes displayed

The city to the soldiers rage resigned
Successless wars , and poverty behind

Ships burnt in fight , or forced on rocky shores
And the rash hunter strangled by the boars

The new-born babe by nurses overlaid
And the cook caught within the raging fire he made

All ills of Mars his nature , flame and steel
The gasping charioteer , beneath the wheel

Of his own car ; the ruin 'd house that falls
And intercepts her lord betwixt the walls

The whole division that to Mars pertains
All trades of death that deal in steel for gains

Were there : the butcher , armourer , and smith
Whose forges sharpen 'd falchions , or the scythe

The scarlet conquest on a tower was placed
With shouts , and soldiers ' acclamations graced

A pointed sword hung threatening o'er his head
Sustain 'd but by a slender twine of thread

There saw I Mars his ides , the Capitol
The seer in vain foretelling Caesar 's fall

The last triumvirs , and the wars they move
And Antony , who lost the world for love

These , and a thousand more , the fane adorn
Their fates were painted ere the men were born

All copied from the heavens , and ruling force
Of the red star , in his revolving course

The form of Mars high on a chariot stood
All sheath 'd in arms , and gruffly look 'd the god

Two geomantic figures were displayed
Above his head , a warrior and a maid

Tired with deformities of death , I haste
To the third temple of Diana chaste

A sylvan scene with various greens was drawn
Shades on the sides , and in the midst a lawn

The silver Cynthia , with her nymphs around
Pursued the flying deer , the woods with horns resound

Calisto there stood manifest of shame
And , turn 'd a bear , the northern star became

Her son was next , and , by peculiar grace
In the cold circle held the second place

The stag Acteon in the stream had spied
The naked huntress , and , for seeing , died

His hounds , unknowing of his change pursue
The chase , and their mistaken master slew

Peneian Daphne too was there to see
Apollo 's love before , and now his tree

The adjoining fane the assembled Greeks expressed
And hunting of the Caledonian beast

Oenides ' valour , and his envied prize
The fatal power of Atalanta 's eyes

Diana 's vengeance on the victor shown
The murderess mother ; and consuming son

The Volscian queen extended on the plain
The treason punish 'd , and the traitor slain

The rest were various huntings , well designed
And savage beasts destroy 'd , of every kind

Her legs were buskin 'd , and the left before
In act to shoot ; a silver bow she bore

She trod a waxing moon , that soon would wane
And , drinking borrow 'd light , be fill 'd again

With downcast eyes , as seeming to survey
The dark dominions , her alternate sway

Before her stood a women in her throes
And call 'd Lucina 's aid , her burden to disclose

All these the painter drew with such command
That Nature snatch 'd the pencil from his hand

Ashamed and angry that his art could feign
And mend the tortures of a mother 's pain

Theseus beheld the fanes of every god
And thought his mighty cost was well bestowed

So princes now their poets should regard
But few can write , and fewer can reward

The theatre thus raised , the lists enclosed
And all with vast magnificence disposed

We leave the monarch pleased , and haste to bring
The knights to combat , and their arms to sing

The day approach 'd when Fortune should decide
The important enterprise , and give the bride

For now , the rivals round the world had sought
And each his number , well appointed , brought

The nations , far and near , contend in choice
And send the flower of war by public voice

That after , or before , were never known
Such chiefs , as each an army seem 'd alone

Beside the champions , all of high degree
Who knighthood loved , and deeds of chivalry

Throng 'd to the lists , and envied to behold
The names of others , not their own , enrolled

Nor seems it strange ; for every noble knight
Who loves the fair , and is endued with might

There breathes not scarce a man on British ground
( An isle for love and arms of old renowned

But would have sold his life to purchase fame
To Palamon or Arcite sent his name

And had the land selected of the best
Half had come hence , and let the world provide the rest

A hundred knights with Palamon there came
Approved in fight , and men of mighty name

Their arms were several , as their nations were
But furnish 'd all alike with sword and spear

Some wore coat-armour , imitating scale
And next their skins were stubborn shirts of mail

Some wore a breastplate and a light jupon
Their horses clothed with rich caparison

Some for defence would leathern bucklers use
Of folded hides ; and others shields of pruce

One hung a pole-axe at his saddle-bow
And one a heavy mace to stun the foe

One for his legs and knees provided well
With jambeaux arm 'd , and double plates of steel

This on his helmet wore a lady 's glove
And that a sleeve embroider 'd by his love

With Palamon above the rest in place
Lycurgus came , the surly king of Thrace

The balls of his broad eyes roll 'd in his head
And glared betwixt a yellow and a red

He look 'd a lion with a gloomy stare
And o'er his eyebrows hung his matted hair

Big-boned , and large of limbs , with sinews strong
Broad-shoulder 'd , and his arms were round and long

Four milk-white bulls ( the Thracian use of old
Were yoked to draw his car of burnish 'd gold

Upright he stood , and bore aloft his shield
Conspicuous from afar , and overlook 'd the field

His surcoat was a bear-skin on his back
His hair hung long behind , and glossy raven black

His ample forehead bore a coronet
With sparkling diamonds and with rubies set

Ten brace , and more , of greyhounds , snowy fair
And tall as stags , ran loose , and coursed around his chair

With golden muzzles all their mouths were bound
And collars of the same their necks surround

Thus through the fields Lycurgus took his way
His hundred knights attend in pomp and proud array

To match this monarch , with strong Arcite came
Emetrius , king of Ind , a mighty name

On a bay courser , goodly to behold
The trappings of his horse adorn 'd with barbarous gold

Not Mars bestrod a steed with greater grace
His surcoat o'er his arms was cloth of Thrace

Adorn 'd with pearls , all orient , round , and great
His saddle was of gold , with emeralds set

His shoulders large a mantle did attire
With rubies thick , and sparkling as the fire

His amber-colour 'd locks in ringlets run
With graceful negligence , and shone against the sun

His nose was aquiline , his eyes were blue
Ruddy his lips , and fresh and fair his hue

Some sprinkled freckles on his face were seen
Whose dusk set off the whiteness of the skill

His awful presence did the crowd surprise
Nor durst the rash spectator meet his eyes

Eyes that confess 'd him born for kingly sway
So fierce , they flash 'd intolerable day

His age in nature 's youthful prime appeared
And just began to bloom his yellow beard

Whene'er he spoke , his voice was heard around
Loud as a trumpet , with a silver sound

A laurel wreathed his temples , fresh and green
And myrtle sprigs , the marks of love , were mix 'd between

Upon his fist he bore , for his delight
An eagle well reclaim 'd , and lily white

His hundred knights attend him to the war
All arm 'd for battle ; save their heads were bare

Words and devices blazed on every shield
And pleasing was the terror of the field

For kings , and dukes , and barons , you might see
Like sparkling stars , though different in degree

Before the king tame leopards led the way
And troops of lions innocently play

So Bacchus through the conquer 'd Indies rode
And beasts in gambols frisk 'd before their honest god

In this array , the war of either side
Through Athens pass 'd with military pride

At prime , they enter 'd on the Sunday morn
Rich tapestry spread the streets , and flowers the posts adorn

The town was all a jubilee of feasts
So Theseus will 'd , in honour of his guests

Himself with open arms the kings embraced
Then all the rest in their degrees were graced

No harbinger was needful for the night
For every house was proud to lodge a knight

I pass the royal treat , nor must relate
The gifts bestow 'd , nor how the champions sate

Who first , who last , or how the knights addressed
Their vows , or who was fairest at the feast

Whose voice , whose graceful dance did most surprise
Soft amorous sighs , and silent love of eyes

The rivals call my Muse another way
To sing their vigils for the ensuing day

'T was ebbing darkness , past the noon of night
And Phosphor , on the confines of the light

Promised the sun ; ere day began to spring
The tuneful lark already stretch 'd her wing

When wakeful Palamon , preventing day
Took to the royal lists his early way

There , falling on his knees before her shrine
He thus implored with prayers her power divine

Creator Venus , genial power of love
The bliss of men below , and gods above

Beneath the sliding sun thou runn'st thy race
Dost fairest shine , and best become thy place

For thee the winds their eastern blasts forbear
Thy month reveals the spring , and opens all the year

For thee the lion loathes the taste of blood
And , roaring , hunts his female through the wood

For thee the bulls rebellow through the groves
And tempt the stream , and snuff their absent loves

'T is thine , whate'er is pleasant , good , or fair
All nature is thy province , life thy care

Thou gladder of the mount of Cytheron
Increase of Jove , companion of the sun

If e'er Adonis touch 'd thy tender heart
Have pity , goddess , for thou know'st the smart

Alas ! I have not words to tell my grief
To vent my sorrow would be some relief

Light sufferings give us leisure to complain
We groan , but can not speak , in greater pain

O goddess ! tell thyself what I would say
Thou know'st it , and I feel too much to pray

So grant my suit , as I enforce my might
In love to be thy champion , and thy knight

A servant to thy sex , a slave to thee
A foe profess 'd to barren chastity

Nor ask I fame or honour of the field
Nor choose I more to vanquish than to yield

In my divine Emilia make me blest
Let Fate , or partial Chance , dispose the rest

Find thou the manner , and the means prepare
Possession , more than conquest , is my care

Mars is the warrior 's god ; in him it lies
On whom he favours to confer the prize

With smiling aspect you serenely move
In your fifth orb , and rule the realm of love

The Fates but only spin the coarser clue
The finest of the wool is left for you

Spare me but one small portion of the twine
And let the sisters cut below your line

The rest among the rubbish may they sweep
Or add it to the yarn of some old miser 's heap

But , if you this ambitious prayer deny
( A wish , I grant , beyond mortality

Then let me sink beneath proud Arcite 's arms
And I once dead , let him possess her charms

Thus ended he ; then with observance due
The sacred incense on her altar threw

The curling smoke mounts heavy from the fires
At length it catches flame , and in a blaze expires

At once the gracious goddess gave the sign
Her statue shook , and trembled all the shrine

Pleased Palamon the tardy omen took
For , since the flames pursued the trailing smoke

He knew his boon was granted ; but the day
To distance driven , and joy adjourn 'd with long delay

Now morn with rosy light had streak 'd the sky
Up rose the sun , and up rose Emily

Address 'd her early steps to Cynthia 's fane
In state attended by her maiden train

Who bore the vests that holy rites require
Incense , and odorous gums , and cover 'd fire

The plenteous horns with pleasant mead they crown
Nor wanted aught besides in honour of the Moon

Now while the temple smoked with hallow 'd steam
They wash the virgin in a living stream

The secret ceremonies I conceal
Uncouth , perhaps unlawful , to reveal

But such they were as Pagan use required
Perform 'd by women when the men retired

Whose eyes profane their chaste mysterious rites
Might turn to scandal , or obscene delights

Well-meaners think no harm ; but for the rest
Things sacred they pervert , and silence is the best

Her shining hair , uncomb 'd , was loosely spread
A crown of mastless oak adorn 'd her head

When to the shrine approach 'd , the spotless maid
Had kindling fires on either altar laid

( The rites were such as were observed of old
By Statius in his Theban story told

Then kneeling with her hands across her breast
Thus lowly she preferr 'd her chaste request

Oh , goddess , haunter of the woodland green
To whom both heaven and earth and seas are seen

Queen of the nether skies , where half the year
Thy silver beams descend , and light the gloomy sphere

Goddess of maids , and conscious of our hearts
So keep me from the vengeance of thy darts

Which Niobe 's devoted issue felt
When hissing through the skies the feather 'd deaths were dealt

As I desire to live a virgin life
Nor know the name of mother or of wife

Thy votress from my tender years I am
And love , like thee , the woods and sylvan game

Like death , thou know'st , I loathe the nuptial state
And man , the tyrant of our sex , I hate

Where love is duty on the female side
On theirs , mere sensual gust , and sought with surly pride

Now by thy triple shape , as thou art seen
In heaven , earth , hell , and everywhere a queen

Grant this my first desire ; let discord cease
And make betwixt the rivals lasting peace

Quench their hot fire , or far from me remove
The flame , and turn it on some other love

Or , if my frowning stars have so decreed
That one must be rejected , one succeed

Make him my lord , within whose faithful breast
Is fix 'd my image , and who loves me best

But , oh ! even that avert ! I choose it not
But take it as the least unhappy lot

A maid I am , and of thy virgin train
Oh , let me still that spotless name retain

Frequent the forests , thy chaste will obey
And only make the beasts of chase my prey

The flames ascend on either altar clear
While thus the blameless maid address 'd her prayer

When , lo ! the burning fire that shone so bright
Flew off all sudden , with extinguish 'd light

And left one altar dark , a little space
Which turn 'd self-kindled , and renew 'd the blaze

The other victor-flame a moment stood
Then fell , and lifeless left the extinguish 'd wood

For ever lost , the irrevocable light
Forsook the blackening coals , and sunk to night

At either end it whistled as it flew
And as the brands were green , so dropp 'd the dew

The maid from that ill omen turn 'd her eyes
And with loud shrieks and clamours rent the skies

Nor knew what signified the boding sign
But found the Powers displeased , and fear 'd the wrath divine

Then shook the sacred shrine , and sudden light
Sprung through the vaulted roof , and made the temple bright

The Power , behold ! the Power in glory shone
By her bent bow , and her keen arrows known

The rest , a huntress issuing from the wood
Reclining on her cornel spear she stood

Then gracious thus began : Dismiss thy fear
And Heaven 's unchanged decrees attentive hear

More powerful gods have torn thee from my side
Unwilling to resign , and doom 'd a bride

The two contending knights are weigh 'd above
One Mars protects , and one the Queen of Love

But which the man , is in the Thunderer 's breast
This he pronounced , 'T is he who loves thee best

The fire that , once extinct , revived again
Foreshows the love allotted to remain

Farewell ! she said , and vanish 'd from the place
The sheaf of arrows shook , and rattled in the case

Aghast at this , the royal virgin stood
Disclaim 'd , and now no more a sister of the wood

But to the parting goddess thus she prayed
Propitious still be present to my aid

Then sighing she return 'd ; but smiled betwixt
With hopes and fears , and joys with sorrows mixed

The next returning planetary hour
Of Mars , who shared the heptarchy of power

His steps bold Arcite to the temple bent
To adore with Pagan rites the power armipotent

Then prostrate , low before his altar lay
And raised his manly voice , and thus began to pray

Strong God of arms , whose iron sceptre sways
The freezing North , and Hyperborean seas

And Scythian colds , and Thracia 's wintry coast
Where stand thy steeds , and thou art honour 'd most

There most ; but everywhere thy power is known
The fortune of the fight is all thy own

Terror is thine , and wild amazement , flung
From out thy chariot , withers even the strong

And disarray and shameful rout ensue
And force is added to the fainting crew

Acknowledged as thou art , accept my prayer
If aught I have achieved deserve thy care

If to my utmost power , with sword and shield
I dared the death , unknowing how to yield

Then let my arms prevail , by thee sustained
That Emily by conquest may be gained

Have pity on my pains ; nor those unknown
To Mars , which , when a lover , were his own

Venus , the public care of all above
Thy stubborn heart has soften 'd into love

Now , by her blandishments and powerful charms
When yielded she lay curling in thy arms

Even by thy shame , if shame it may be called
When Vulcan had thee in his net enthralled

( Oh , envied ignominy , sweet disgrace
When every god that saw thee wish 'd thy place

By those dear pleasures , aid my arms in fight
And make me conquer in my patron 's right

For I am young , a novice in the trade
The fool of love , unpractised to persuade

And want the soothing arts that catch the fair
But , caught myself , lie struggling in the snare

And she I love , or laughs at all my pain
Or knows her worth too well ; and pays me with disdain

For sure I am , unless I win in arms
To stand excluded from Emilia 's charms

Nor can my strength avail , unless by thee
Endued with force , I gain the victory

Then for the fire which warm 'd thy generous heart
Pity thy subject 's pains , and equal smart

So be the morrow 's sweat and labour mine
The palm and honour of the conquest thine

Then shall the war , and stern debate , and strife
Immortal , be the business of my life

And in thy fane , the dusty spoils among
High on the burnish 'd roof , my banner shall be hung

Rank 'd with my champions ' bucklers , and below
With arms reversed , the achievements of my foe

And while these limbs the vital spirit feeds
While day to night , and night to day succeeds

Thy smoking altar shall be fat with food
Of incense , and the grateful steam of blood

Burnt-offerings morn and evening shall be thine
And fires eternal in thy temple shine

The bush of yellow beard , this length of hair
Which from my birth inviolate I bear

Guiltless of steel , and from the razor free
Shall fall a plenteous crop , reserved for thee

So may my arms with victory be blest
I ask no more ; let Fate dispose the rest

The champion ceased ; there follow 'd in the close
A hollow groan : a murmuring wind arose

The rings of iron , that on the doors were hung
Sent out a jarring sound , and harshly rung

The bolted gates flew open at the blast
The storm rush 'd in , and Arcite stood aghast

The flames were blown aside , yet shone they bright
Fann 'd by the wind , and gave a ruffled light

Then from the ground a scent began to rise
Sweet smelling , as accepted sacrifice

This omen pleased , and as the flames aspire
With odorous incense Arcite heaps the fire

Nor wanted hymns to Mars , or heathen charms
At length the nodding statue clash 'd his arms

And with a sullen sound and feeble cry
Half sunk , and half pronounced the word of victory

For this , with soul devout , he thank 'd the god
And , of success secure , return 'd to his abode

These vows thus granted , raised a strife above
Betwixt the God of War and Queen of Love

She , granting first , had right of time to plead
But he had granted too , nor would recede

Jove was for Venus ; but he fear 'd his wife
And seem 'd unwilling to decide the strife

Till Saturn from his leaden throne arose
And found a way the difference to compose

Though sparing of his grace , to mischief bent
He seldom does a good with good intent

Wayward , but wise ; by long experience taught
To please both parties , for ill ends , he sought

For this advantage age from youth has won
As not to be outridden , though outrun

By fortune he was now to Venus trined
And with stern Mars in Capricorn was joined

Of him disposing in his own abode
He soothed the goddess , while he gull 'd the god

Cease , daughter , to complain , and stint the strife
Thy Palamon shall have his promised wife

And Mars , the lord of conquest , in the fight
With palm and laurel shall adorn his knight

Wide is my course , nor turn I to my place
Till length of time , and move with tardy pace

Man feels me , when I press the ethereal plains
My hand is heavy , and the wound remains

Mine is the shipwreck , in a watery sign
And in an earthy , the dark dungeon mine

The throttling quinsey 't is my star appoints
And rheumatisms ascend to rack the joints

When churls rebel against their native prince
I arm their hands , and furnish the pretence

And housing in the lion 's hateful sign
Bought senates , and deserting troops are mine

Mine is the privy poisoning ; I command
Unkindly seasons , and ungrateful land

By me kings ' palaces are push 'd to ground
And miners crush 'd beneath their mines are found

'T was I slew Samson , when the pillar 'd hall
Fell down , and crush 'd the many with the fall

My looking is the sire of pestilence
That sweeps at once the people and the prince

Now weep no more , but trust thy grandsire 's art
Mars shall be pleased , and thou perform thy part

'T is ill , though different your complexions are
The family of heaven for men should war

The expedient pleased , where neither lost his right
Mars had the day , and Venus had the night

The management they left to Chronos ' care
Now turn we to the effect , and sing the war

In Athens all was pleasure , mirth , and play
All proper to the spring , and spritely May

Which every soul inspired with such delight
'T was jesting all the day , and love at night

Heaven smiled , and gladded was the heart of man
And Venus had the world as when it first began

At length in sleep their bodies they compose
And dreamt the future fight , and early rose

Now scarce the dawning day began to spring
As at a signal given , the streets with clamours ring

The gods came downward to behold the wars
Sharpening their sights , and leaning from their stars

The neighing of the generous horse was heard
For battle by the busy groom prepared

Rustling of harness , rattling of the shield
Clattering of armour , furbish 'd for the field

Crowds to the castle mounted up the street
Battering the pavement with their coursers ' feet

The greedy sight might there devour the gold
Of glittering arms , too dazzling to behold

And polish 'd steel , that cast the view aside
And crested morions , with their plumy pride

Knights , with a long retinue of their squires
In gaudy liveries march , and quaint attires

One laced the helm , another held the lance
A third the shining buckler did advance

The courser paw 'd the ground with restless feet
And snorting foam 'd , and champ 'd the golden bit

The smiths and armourers on palfreys ride
Files in their hands , and hammers at their side

The yeomen guard the streets , in seemly bands
And clowns come crowding on , with cudgels in their hands

The trumpets , next the gate , in order placed
Attend the sign to sound the martial blast

The palace-yard is fill 'd with floating tides
And the last comers bear the former to the sides

The throng is in the midst : the common crew
Shut out , the hall admits the better few

In knots they stand , or in a rank they walk
Serious in aspect , earnest in their talk

Factious , and favouring this or the other side
As their strong fancy or weak reason guide

Their wagers back their wishes ; numbers hold
With the fair freckled king , and beard of gold

So vigorous are his eyes , such rays they cast
So prominent his eagle 's beak is placed

But most their looks on the black monarch bend
His rising muscles , and his brawn commend

His double-biting axe , and beamy spear
Each asking a gigantic force to rear

All spoke as partial favour moved the mind
And , safe themselves , at others ' cost divined

Waked by the cries , the Athenian chief arose
The knightly forms of combat to dispose

And passing through the obsequious guards , he sate
Conspicuous on a throne , sublime in state

There , for the two contending knights he sent
Arm 'd cap-a-pie , with reverence low they bent

He smiled on both , and with superior look
Alike their offer 'd adoration took

The people press on every side to see
Their awful prince , and hear his high decree

Then signing to their heralds with his hand
They gave his orders from their lofty stand

Silence is thrice enjoin 'd ; then thus aloud
The king-at-arms bespeaks the knights and listening crowd

Our sovereign lord has ponder 'd in his mind
The means to spare the blood of gentle kind

And of his grace , and inborn clemency
He modifies his first severe decree

The keener edge of battle to rebate
The troops for honour fighting , not for hate

He wills , not death should terminate their strife
And wounds , if wounds ensue , be short of life

But issues , ere the fight , his dread command
That slings afar , and poniards hand to hand

Be banish 'd from the field ; that none shall dare
With shorten 'd sword to stab in closer war

But in fair combat fight with manly strength
Nor push with biting point , but strike at length

The tourney is allow 'd but one career
Of the tough ash , with the sharp-grinded spear

But knights unhorsed may rise from off the plain
And fight on foot their honour to regain

Nor , if at mischief taken , on the ground
Be slain , but prisoners to the pillar bound

At either barrier placed ; nor ( captives made
Be freed , or arm 'd anew the fight invade

The chief of either side , bereft of life
Or yielded to his foe , concludes the strife

Thus dooms the lord : now , valiant knights and young
Fight each his fill with swords and maces long

The herald ends : the vaulted firmament
With loud acclaims and vast applause is rent

Heaven guard a prince so gracious and so good
So just , and yet so provident of blood

This was the general cry . The trumpets sound
And warlike symphony is heard around

The marching troops through Athens take their way
The great earl-marshal orders their array

The fair from high the passing pomp behold
A rain of flowers is from the windows rolled

The casements are with golden tissue spread
And horses ' hoofs , for earth , on silken tapestry tread

The king goes midmost , and the rivals ride
In equal rank , and close his either side

Next after these , there rode the royal wife
With Emily , the cause , and the reward of strife

The following cavalcade , by three and three
Proceed by titles marshall 'd in degree

Thus through the southern gate they take their way
And at the list arrived ere prime of day

There , parting from the king , the chiefs divide
And wheeling east and west , before their many ride

The Athenian monarch mounts his throne on high
And after him the queen and Emily

Next these , the kindred of the crown are graced
With nearer seats , and lords by ladies placed

Scarce were they seated , when with clamours loud
In rush 'd at once a rude promiscuous crowd

The guards , and then each other overbear
And in a moment throng the spacious theatre

Now changed the jarring noise to whispers low
As winds forsaking seas more softly blow

When at the western gate , on which the car
Is placed aloft , that bears the god of war

Proud Arcite entering arm 'd before his train
Stops at the barrier , and divides the plain

Red was his banner , and display 'd abroad
The bloody colours of his patron god

At that self moment enters Palamon
The gate of Venus , and the rising Sun

Waved by the wanton winds , his banner flies
All maiden white , and shares the people 's eyes

From east to west , look all the world around
Two troops so match 'd were never to be found

Such bodies built for strength , of equal age
In stature sized ; so proud in equipage

The nicest eye could no distinction make
Where lay the advantage , or what side to take

Thus ranged , the herald for the last proclaims
A silence , while they answer 'd to their names

For so the king decreed , to shun the care
The fraud of musters false , the common bane of war

The tale was just , and then the gates were closed
And chief to chief , and troop to troop opposed

The heralds last retired , and loudly cried
The fortune of the field be fairly tried

At this , the challenger with fierce defy
His trumpet sounds ; the challenged makes reply

Their vizors closed , their lances in the rest
Or at the helmet pointed , or the crest

They vanish from the barrier , speed the race
And spurring see decrease the middle space

A cloud of smoke envelops either host
And all at once the combatants are lost

Darkling they join adverse , and shock unseen
Coursers with coursers jostling , men with men

As labouring in eclipse , a while they stay
Till the next blast of wind restores the day

They look anew : the beauteous form of fight
Is changed , and war appears a grisly sight

Two troops in fair array one moment showed
The next , a field with fallen bodies strowed

Not half the number in their seats are found
But men and steeds lie grovelling on the ground

The points of spears are stuck within the shield
The steeds without their riders scour the field

The knights , unhorsed , on foot renew the fight
The glittering falchions cast a gleaming light

Hauberks and helms are hew 'd with many a wound
Out spins the streaming blood and dyes the ground

The mighty maces with such haste descend
They break the bones , and make the solid armour bend

This thrusts amid the throng with furious force
Down goes , at once , the horseman and the horse

That courser stumbles on the fallen steed
And floundering throws the rider o'er his head

One rolls along , a foot-ball to his foes
One with a broken truncheon deals his blows

This halting , this disabled with his wound
In triumph led , is to the pillar bound

Where by the king 's award he must abide
There goes a captive led on the other side

By fits they cease ; and leaning on the lance
Take breath a while , and to new fight advance

Full oft the rivals met , and neither spared
His utmost force , and each forgot to ward

The head of this was to the saddle bent
The other backward to the crupper sent

Both were by turns unhorsed ; the jealous blows
Fall thick and heavy , when on foot they close

So deep their falchions bite , that every stroke
Pierced to the quick ; and equal wounds they gave and took

Borne far asunder by the tides of men
Like adamant and steel they meet again

So when a tiger sucks the bullock 's blood
A famish 'd lion issuing from the wood

Each claims possession , neither will obey
But both their paws are fasten 'd on the prey

They bite , they tear ; and while in vain they strive
The swains come arm 'd between , and both to distance drive

At length , as Fate foredoom 'd , and all things tend
By course of time to their appointed end

So when the sun to west was far declined
And both afresh in mortal battle joined

The strong Emetrius came in Arcite 's aid
And Palamon with odds was overlaid

For turning short , he struck with all his might
Full on the helmet of the unwary knight

Deep was the wound ; he stagger 'd with the blow
And turn 'd him to his unexpected foe

Whom with such force he struck , he fell 'd him down
And cleft the circle of his golden crown

But Arcite 's men , who now prevail 'd in fight
Twice ten at once surround the single knight

O'erpower 'd , at length , they force him to the ground
Unyielded as he was , and to the pillar bound

And King Lycurgus , while he fought in vain
His friend to free , was tumbled on the plain

Who now laments but Palamon , compelled
No more to try the fortune of the field

And , worse than death , to view with hateful eyes
His rival 's conquest , and renounce the prize

The royal judge , on his tribunal placed
Who had beheld the fight from first to last

Bade cease the war ; pronouncing from on high
Arcite of Thebes had won the beauteous Emily

The sound of trumpets to the voice replied
And round the royal lists the heralds cried

The people rend the skies with vast applause
All own the chief , when Fortune owns the cause

Arcite is own 'd even by the gods above
And conquering Mars insults the Queen of Love

So laugh 'd he , when the rightful Titan failed
And Jove 's usurping arms in heaven prevailed

Laugh 'd all the powers who favour tyranny
And all the standing army of the sky

But Venus with dejected eyes appears
And , weeping on the lists , distill 'd her tears

Her will refused , which grieves a woman most
And , in her champion foil 'd , the cause of Love is lost

Till Saturn said , Fair daughter , now be still
The blustering fool has satisfied his will

His boon is given ; his knight has gain 'd the day
But lost the prize ; the arrears are yet to pay

Thy hour is come , and mine the care shall be
To please thy knight , and set thy promise free

Now while the heralds run the lists around
And Arcite ! Arcite ! heaven and earth resound

A miracle ( nor less it could be called
Their joy with unexpected sorrow palled

The victor knight had laid his helm aside
Part for his ease , the greater part for pride

Bare-headed , popularly low he bowed
And paid the salutations of the crowd

Then spurring at full speed , ran endlong on
Where Theseus sate on his imperial throne

Furious he drove , and upward cast his eye
Where , next the queen , was placed his Emily

Then passing , to the saddle-bow he bent
A sweet regard the gracious virgin lent

( For women , to the brave an easy prey
Still follow Fortune where she leads the way

Just then , from earth sprung out a flashing fire
By Pluto sent , at Saturn 's bad desire

The startling steed was seized with sudden fright
And , bounding , o'er the pommel cast the knight

Forward he flew , and pitching on his head
He quiver 'd with his feet , and lay for dead

Black was his countenance in a little space
For all the blood was gather 'd in his face

Help was at hand : they rear 'd him from the ground
And from his cumbrous arms his limbs unbound

Then lanced a vein , and watch 'd returning breath
It came , but clogg 'd with symptoms of his death

The saddle-bow the noble parts had pressed
All bruised and mortified his manly breast

Him still entranced , and in a litter laid
They bore from field , and to his bed conveyed

At length he waked , and with a feeble cry
The word he first pronounced was `` Emily

Mean time the king , though inwardly he mourned
In pomp triumphant to the town returned

Attended by the chiefs , who fought the field
( Now friendly mix 'd , and in one troop compelled

Composed his looks to counterfeited cheer
And bade them not for Arcite 's life to fear

But that which gladded all the warrior train
Though most were sorely wounded , none were slain

The surgeons soon despoil 'd them of their arms
And some with salves they cure , and some with charms

Foment the bruises , and the pains assuage
And heal their inward hurts with sovereign draughts of sage

The king in person visits all around
Comforts the sick , congratulates the sound

Honours the princely chiefs , rewards the rest
And holds for thrice three days a royal feast

None was disgraced ; for falling is no shame
And cowardice alone is loss of fame

The venturous knight is from the saddle thrown
But 't is the fault of Fortune , not his own

If crowds and palms the conquering side adorn
The victor under better stars was born

The brave man seeks not popular applause
Nor , overpower 'd with arms , deserts his cause

Unshamed , though foil 'd , he does the best he can
Force is of brutes , but honour is of man

Thus Theseus smiled on all with equal grace
And each was set according to his place

With ease were reconciled the differing parts
For envy never dwells in noble hearts

At length they took their leave , the time expired
Well pleased , and to their several homes retired

Mean while the health of Arcite still impairs
From bad proceeds to worse , and mocks the leech 's cares

Swoln is his breast ; his inward pains increase
All means are used , and all without success

The clotted blood lies heavy on his heart
Corrupts , and there remains , in spite of art

Nor breathing veins , nor cupping will prevail
All outward remedies and inward fail

The mould of nature 's fabric is destroyed
Her vessels discomposed , her virtue void

The bellows of his lungs begin to swell
All out of frame is every secret cell

Those breathing organs thus within oppressed
With venom soon distend the sinews of his breast

Nought profits him to save abandon 'd life
Nor vomit 's upward aid , nor downward laxative

The midmost region batter 'd and destroyed
When nature can not work , the effect of art is void

For physic can but mend our crazy state
Patch an old building , not a new create

Arcite is doom 'd to die in all his pride
Must leave his youth , and yield his beauteous bride

Gain 'd hardly , against right , and unenjoyed
When 't was declared all hope of life was past

Conscience ( that of all physic works the last
Caused him to send for Emily in haste

With her , at his desire , came Palamon
Then on his pillow raised , he thus begun

No language can express the smallest part
Of what I feel , and suffer in my heart

For you , whom best I love and value most
But to your service I bequeath my ghost

Which from this mortal body when untied
Unseen , unheard , shall hover at your side

Nor fright you waking , nor your sleep offend
But wait officious , and your steps attend

How I have loved , excuse my faltering tongue
My spirit 's feeble , and my pains are strong

This I may say , I only grieve to die
Because I lose my charming Emily

To die , when Heaven had put you in my power
Fate could not choose a more malicious hour

What greater curse could envious Fortune give
Than just to die , when I began to live

Vain men ! how vanishing a bliss we crave
Now warm in love , now withering in the grave

Never , oh never more to see the sun
Still dark , in a damp vault , and still alone

This fate is common ; but I lose my breath
Near bliss , and yet not bless 'd before my death

Farewell ; but take me dying in your arms
'T is all I can enjoy of all your charms

This hand I can not but in death resign
Ah ! could I live ! but while I live 't is mine

I feel my end approach , and thus embraced
Am pleased to die ; but hear me speak my last

Ah ! my sweet foe , for you , and you alone
I broke my faith with injured Palamon

But love the sense of right and wrong confounds
Strong love and proud ambition have no bounds

And much I doubt , should Heaven my life prolong
I should return to justify my wrong

For while my former flames remain within
Repentance is but want of power to sin

With mortal hatred I pursued his life
Nor he , nor you , were guilty of the strife

Nor I , but as I loved ; yet all combined
Your beauty , and my impotence of mind

And his concurrent flame that blew my fire
For still our kindred souls had one desire

He had a moment 's right in point of time
Had I seen first , then his had been the crime

Fate made it mine , and justified his right
Nor holds this earth a more deserving knight

For virtue , valour , and for noble blood
Truth , honour , all that is comprised in good

So help me Heaven , in all the world is none
So worthy to be loved as Palamon

He loves you too , with such an holy fire
As will not , can not , but with life expire

Our vow 'd affections both have often tried
Nor any love but yours could ours divide

Then , by my love 's inviolable band
By my long suffering , and my short command

If e'er you plight your vows when I am gone
Have pity on the faithful Palamon

This was his last ; for Death came on amain
And exercised below his iron reign

Then upward to the seat of life he goes
Sense fled before him , what he touch 'd he froze

Yet could he not his closing eyes withdraw
Though less and less of Emily he saw

So , speechless , for a little space he lay
Then grasp 'd the hand he held , and sigh 'd his soul away

But whither went his soul , let such relate
Who search the secrets of the future state

Divines can say but what themselves believe
Strong proofs they have , but not demonstrative

For , were all plain , then all sides must agree
And faith itself be lost in certainty

To live uprightly , then , is sure the best
To save ourselves , and not to damn the rest

The soul of Arcite went where heathens go
Who better live than we , though less they know

In Palamon a manly grief appears
Silent , he wept , ashamed to show his tears

Emilia shriek 'd but once , and then , oppressed
With sorrow , sunk upon her lover 's breast

Till Theseus in his arms convey 'd with care
Far from so sad a sight , the swooning fair

'Twere loss of time her sorrow to relate
Ill bears the sex a youthful lover 's fate

But like a low-hung cloud , it rains so fast
That all at once it falls , and can not last

The face of things is changed , and Athens now
That laugh 'd so late , becomes the scene of woe

Matrons and maids , both sexes , every state
With tears lament the knight 's untimely fate

Nor greater grief in falling Troy was seen
For Hector 's death ; but Hector was not then

Old men with dust deform 'd their hoary hair
The women beat their breasts , their cheeks they tear

Why wouldst thou go , with one consent they cry
When thou hadst gold enough , and Emily

Theseus himself , who should have cheer 'd the grief
Of others , wanted now the same relief

Old Egeus only could revive his son
Who various changes of the world had known

And strange vicissitudes of human fate
Still altering , never in a steady state

Good after ill , and , after pain , delight
Alternate like the scenes of day and night

Since every man who lives , is born to die
And none can boast sincere felicity

With equal mind , what happens , let us bear
Nor joy , nor grieve too much for things beyond our care

Like pilgrims to the appointed place we tend
The world 's an inn , and death the journey 's end

Even kings but play ; and when their part is done
Some other , worse or better , mount the throne

With words like these the crowd was satisfied
And so they would have been , had Theseus died

And after long debate , at last he found
( As love itself had mark 'd the spot of ground

That grove for ever green , that conscious laund
Where he with Palamon fought hand to hand

That where he fed his amorous desires
With soft complaints , and felt his hottest fires

There other flames might waste his earthly part
And burn his limbs , where love had burn 'd his heart

This once resolved , the peasants were enjoined
Sere-wood , and firs , and dodder 'd oaks to find

With sounding axes to the grove they go
Fell , split , and lay the fuel on a row

Vulcanian food : a bier is next prepared
On which the lifeless body should be reared

Cover 'd with cloth of gold , on which was laid
The corpse of Arcite , in like robes arrayed

White gloves were on his hands , and on his head
A wreath of laurel , mix 'd with myrtle spread

A sword keen-edged within his right he held
The warlike emblem of the conquer 'd field

Bare was his manly visage on the bier
Menaced his countenance ; even in death severe

Then to the palace-hall they bore the knight
To lie in solemn state , a public sight

Groans , cries , and howlings fill the crowded place
And unaffected sorrow sate on every face

Sad Palamon above the rest appears
In sable garments , dew 'd with gushing tears

His auburn locks on either shoulder flowed
Which to the funeral of his friend he vowed

But Emily , as chief , was next his side
A virgin-widow , and a mourning bride

And that the princely obsequies might be
Perform 'd according to his high degree

The steed , that bore him living to the fight
Was trapp 'd with polish 'd steel , all shining bright

The riders rode abreast , and one his shield
His lance of cornel-wood another held

The third his bow , and , glorious to behold
The costly quiver , all of burnish 'd gold

The noblest of the Grecians next appear
And , weeping , on their shoulders bore the bier

With sober pace they march 'd , and often stayed
And through the master-street the corpse conveyed

The houses to their tops with black were spread
And even the pavements were with mourning hid

The right side of the pall old Egeus kept
And on the left the royal Theseus wept

Each bore a golden bowl , of work divine
With honey fill 'd , and milk , and mix 'd with ruddy wine

Then Palamon , the kinsman of the slain
And after him appear 'd the illustrious train

To grace the pomp , came Emily the bright
With cover 'd fire , the funeral pile to light

With high devotion was the service made
And all the rites of Pagan honour paid

So lofty was the pile , a Parthian bow
With vigour drawn , must send the shaft below

The bottom was full twenty fathom broad
With crackling straw beneath in due proportion strewed

The fabric seem 'd a wood of rising green
With sulphur and bitumen cast between

To feed the flames : the trees were unctuous fir
And mountain-ash , the mother of the spear

The mourner-yew , and builder oak were there
The beech , the swimming alder , and the plane

Hard box , and linden of a softer grain
And laurels , which the gods for conquering chiefs ordain

How they were rank 'd , shall rest untold by me
With nameless Nymphs that lived in every tree

Nor how the Dryads , or the woodland train
Disherited , ran howling o'er the plain

Nor how the birds to foreign seats repaired
Or beasts , that bolted out , and saw the forest bared

Nor how the ground , now clear 'd , with ghastly fright
Beheld the sudden sun , a stranger to the light

The straw , as first I said , was laid below
Of chips and sere-wood was the second row

The third of greens , and timber newly felled
The fourth high stage the fragrant odours held

And pearls , and precious stones , and rich array
In midst of which , embalm 'd , the body lay

The service sung , the maid with mourning eyes
The stubble fired ; the smouldering flames arise

This office done , she sunk upon the ground
But what she spoke , recover 'd from her swound

I want the wit in moving words to dress
But by themselves the tender sex may guess

While the devouring fire was burning fast
Rich jewels in the flame the wealthy cast

And some their shields , and some their lances threw
And gave their warrior 's ghost a warrior 's due

Then thrice the mounted squadrons ride around
The fire , and Arcite 's name they thrice resound

Hail , and farewell ! they shouted thrice amain
Thrice facing to the left , and thrice they turn 'd again

Still as they turn 'd , they beat their clattering shields
The women mix their cries ; and clamour fills the fields

The warlike wakes continued all the night
And funeral games were play 'd at new returning light

Who naked wrestled best , besmear 'd with oil
Or who with gauntlets gave or took the foil

I will not tell you , nor would you attend
But briefly haste to my long story 's end

I pass the rest ; the year was fully mourned
And Palamon long since to Thebes returned

When , by the Grecians ' general consent
At Athens Theseus held his parliament

Among the laws that pass 'd , it was decreed
That conquer 'd Thebes from bondage should be freed

Reserving homage to the Athenian throne
To which the sovereign summon 'd Palamon

Unknowing of the cause , he took his way
Mournful in mind , and still in black array

The monarch mounts the throne , and , placed on high
Commands into the court the beauteous Emily

So call 'd , she came ; the senate rose , and paid
Becoming reverence to the royal maid

And first , soft whispers through the assembly went
With silent wonder then they watch 'd the event

All hush 'd , the king arose with awful grace
Deep thought was in his breast , and counsel in his face

At length he sigh 'd ; and having first prepared
The attentive audience , thus his will declared

The Cause and Spring of motion , from above
Hung down on earth the golden chain of Love

Great was the effect , and high was his intent
When peace among the jarring seeds he sent

Fire , flood , and earth , and air by this were bound
And Love , the common link , the new creation crowned

The chain still holds ; for though the forms decay
Eternal matter never wears away

The same First Mover certain bounds has placed
How long those perishable forms shall last

Nor can they last beyond the time assigned
By that all-seeing , and all-making mind

Shorten their hours they may ; for will is free
But never pass the appointed destiny

So men oppress 'd , when weary of their breath
Throw off the burden , and suborn their death

Then since those forms begin , and have their end
On some unalter 'd cause they sure depend

Parts of the whole are we ; but God the whole
Who gives us life , and animating soul

For nature can not from a part derive
That being , which the whole can only give

He perfect , stable ; but imperfect we
Subject to change , and different in degree

Plants , beasts , and man ; and as our organs are
We more or less of his perfection share

But by a long descent , the ethereal fire
Corrupts ; and forms , the mortal part , expire

As he withdraws his virtue , so they pass
And the same matter makes another mass

This law the Omniscient Power was pleased to give
That every kind should by succession live

That individuals die , His will ordains
The propagated species still remains

The monarch oak , the patriarch of the trees
Shoots rising up , and spreads by slow degrees

Three centuries he grows , and three he stays
Supreme in state , and in three more decays

So wears the paving pebble in the street
And towns and towers their fatal periods meet

So rivers , rapid once , now naked lie
Forsaken of their springs ; and leave their channels dry

So man , at first a drop , dilates with heat
Then , form 'd , the little heart begins to beat

Secret he feeds , unknowing in the cell
At length , for hatching ripe , he breaks the shell

And struggles into breath , and cries for aid
Then , helpless , in his mother 's lap is laid

He creeps , he walks , and issuing into man
Grudges their life , from whence his own began

Reckless of laws , affects to rule alone
Anxious to reign , and restless on the throne

First vegetive , then feels , and reasons last
Rich of three souls , and lives all three to waste

Some thus ; but thousands more in flower of age
For few arrive to run the latter stage

Sunk in the first , in battle some are slain
And others whelm 'd beneath the stormy main

What makes all this , but Jupiter the king
At whose command we perish , and we spring

Then 't is our best , since thus ordain 'd to die
To make a virtue of necessity

Take what he gives , since to rebel is vain
The bad grows better , which we well sustain

And could we choose the time , and choose aright
'T is best to die , our honour at the height

When we have done our ancestors no shame
But served our friends , and well secured our fame

Then should we wish our happy life to close
And leave no more for fortune to dispose

So should we make our death a glad relief
From future shame , from sickness , and from grief

Enjoying while we live the present hour
And dying in our excellence and flower

Then round our death-bed every friend should run
And joyous of our conquest early won

While the malicious world with envious tears
Should grudge our happy end , and wish it theirs

With grief as just , a friend may be deplored
From a foul prison to free air restored

Ought he to thank his kinsman or his wife
Could tears recall him into wretched life

Their sorrow hurts themselves ; on him is lost
And worse than both , offends his happy ghost

What then remains , but , after past annoy
To take the good vicissitude of joy

To thank the gracious gods for what they give
Possess our souls , and while we live , to live

Ordain we then two sorrows to combine
And in one point the extremes of grief to join

That thence resulting joy may be renewed
As jarring notes in harmony conclude

Then I propose that Palamon shall be
In marriage join 'd with beauteous Emily

For which already I have gain 'd the assent
Of my free people in full parliament

Long love to her has borne the faithful knight
And well deserved , had fortune done him right

'T is time to mend her fault ; since Emily
By Arcite 's death from former vows is free

If you , fair sister , ratify the accord
And take him for your husband , and your lord

'T is no dishonour to confer your grace
On one descended from a royal race

And were he less , yet years of service past
From grateful souls exact reward at last

Pity is Heaven 's and yours ; nor can she find
A throne so soft as in a woman 's mind

He said ; she blush 'd ; and as o'er-awed by might
Seem 'd to give Theseus what she gave the knight

Then turning to the Theban thus he said
Small arguments are needful to persuade

Your temper to comply with my command
And speaking thus , he gave Emilia 's hand

Smiled Venus , to behold her own true knight
Obtain the conquest , though he lost the fight

Eros , and Anteros , on either side
One fired the bridegroom , and one warm 'd the bride

And long-attending Hymen from above
Shower 'd on the bed the whole Idalian grove

All of a tenor was their after-life
No day discolour 'd with domestic strife

No jealousy , but mutual truth believed
Secure repose , and kindness undeceived

Thus Heaven , beyond the compass of his thought
Sent him the blessing he so dearly bought

So may the Queen of Love long duty bless
And all true lovers find the same success

There lived , as authors tell , in days of yore
A widow somewhat old , and very poor

Deep in a cell her cottage lonely stood
Well thatch 'd , and under covert of a wood

This dowager , on whom my tale I found
Since last she laid her husband in the ground

A simple sober life , in patience , led
And had but just enough to buy her bread

But huswifing the little Heaven had lent
She duly paid a groat for quarter rent

And pinch 'd her belly , with her daughters two
To bring the year about with much ado

The cattle in her homestead were three sows
A ewe call 'd Mally , and three brinded cows

Her parlour-window stuck with herbs around
Of savoury smell ; and rushes strew 'd the ground

A mapple-dresser in her hall she had
On which full many a slender meal she made

For no delicious morsel pass 'd her throat
According to her cloth she cut her coat

No poignant sauce she knew , nor costly treat
Her hunger gave a relish to her meat

A sparing diet did her health assure
Or sick , a pepper posset was her cure

Before the day was done , her work she sped
And never went by candlelight to bed

With exercise she sweat ill humours out
Her dancing was not hindered by the gout

Her poverty was glad ; her heart content
Nor knew she what the spleen or vapours meant

Of wine she never tasted through the year
But white and black was all her homely cheer

Brown bread , and milk ( but first she skimm 'd her bowls
And rashers of singed bacon on the coals

On holy days , an egg or two at most
But her ambition never reach 'd to roast

A yard she had with pales enclosed about
Some high , some low , and a dry ditch without

Within this homestead lived , without a peer
For crowing loud , the noble Chanticleer

So hight her cock , whose singing did surpass
The merry notes of organs at the mass

More certain was the crowing of the cock
To number hours , than is an abbey-clock

And sooner than the matin-bell was rung
He clapp 'd his wings upon his roost , and sung

For when degrees fifteen ascended right
By sure instinct he knew 't was one at night

High was his comb , and coral-red withal
In dents embattled like a castle wall

His bill was raven-black , and shone like jet
Blue were his legs , and orient were his feet

White were his nails , like silver to behold
His body glittering like the burnish 'd gold

This gentle cock , for solace of his life
Six misses had , besides his lawful wife

Scandal that spares no king , though ne'er so good
Says , they were all of his own flesh and blood

His sisters both by sire and mother 's side
And sure their likeness show 'd them near allied

But make the worst , the monarch did no more
Than all the Ptolemys had done before

When incest is for interest of a nation
'T is made no sin by holy dispensation

Some lines have been maintain 'd by this alone
Which by their common ugliness are known

But passing this , as from our tale apart
Dame Partlet was the sovereign of his heart

Ardent in love , outrageous in his play
He feather 'd her a hundred times a day

And she , that was not only passing fair
But was with all discreet , and debonair

Resolved the passive doctrine to fulfil
Though loth ; and let him work his wicked will

At board and bed was affable and kind
According as their marriage vow did bind

Even since she was a se'ennight old , they say
Was chaste and humble to her dying day

By this her husband 's heart she did obtain
What can not beauty , join 'd with virtue , gain

She was his only joy , and he her pride
She , when he walk 'd , went pecking by his side

If spurning up the ground , he sprung a corn
The tribute in his bill to her was borne

But oh ! what joy it was to hear him sing
In summer , when the day began to spring

Stretching his neck , and warbling in his throat
_Solus cum sola_ then was all his note

For in the days of yore , the birds of parts
Were bred to speak , and sing , and learn the liberal arts

It happ 'd that , perching on the parlour-beam
Amidst his wives , he had a deadly dream

Just at the dawn ; and sigh 'd , and groan 'd so fast
As every breath he drew would be his last

Dame Partlet , ever nearest to his side
Heard all his piteous moan , and how he cried

For help from gods and men : and sore aghast
She peck 'd and pull 'd , and waken 'd him at last

Dear heart , said she , for love of heaven declare
Your pain , and make me partner in your care

You groan , sir , ever since the morning-light
As something had disturb 'd your noble sprite

And , madam , well I might , said Chanticleer
Never was shrovetide cock in such a fear

Even still I run all over in a sweat
My princely senses not recover 'd yet

For such a dream I had , of dire portent
That much I fear my body will be shent

It bodes I shall have wars and woful strife
Or in a loathsome dungeon end my life

Know , dame , I dreamt within my troubled breast
That in our yard I saw a murderous beast

With waking eyes I ne'er beheld his fellow
His colour was betwixt a red and yellow

Tipp 'd was his tail , and both his pricking ears
Were black ; and much unlike his other hairs

The rest , in shape a beagle 's whelp throughout
With broader forehead , and a sharper snout

Deep in his front were sunk his glowing eyes
That yet , methinks , I see him with surprise

Reach out your hand , I drop with clammy sweat
And lay it to my heart , and feel it beat

Now fie , for shame , quoth she ; by Heaven above
Thou hast for ever lost thy lady 's love

No woman can endure a recreant knight
He must be bold by day , and free by night

Our sex desires a husband or a friend
Who can our honour and his own defend

Wise , hardy , secret , liberal of his purse
A fool is nauseous , but a coward worse

No bragging coxcomb , yet no baffled knight
How darest thou talk of love , and darest not fight

How darest thou tell thy dame thou art affeared
Hast thou no manly heart , and hast a beard

If aught from fearful dreams may be divined
They signify a cock of dunghill kind

All dreams , as in old Galen I have read
Are from repletion and complexion bred

From rising fumes of indigested food
And noxious humours that infect the blood

And sure , my lord , if I can read aright
These foolish fancies you have had to-night

Are certain symptoms ( in the canting style
Of boiling choler , and abounding bile

This yellow gall , that in your stomach floats
Engenders all these visionary thoughts

When choler overflows , then dreams are bred
Of flames , and all the family of red

Red dragons , and red beasts , in sleep we view
For humours are distinguish 'd by their hue

From hence we dream of wars and warlike things
And wasps and hornets with their double wings

Choler adust congeals our blood with fear
Then black bulls toss us , and black devils tear

In sanguine airy dreams , aloft we bound
With rheums oppress 'd , we sink in rivers drowned

More I could say , but thus conclude my theme
The dominating humour makes the dream

Cato was in his time accounted wise
And he condemns them all for empty lies

Take my advice , and when we fly to ground
With laxatives preserve your body sound

I should be loath to lay you on a bier
And though there lives no pothecary near

I dare for once prescribe for your disease
And save long bills , and a damn 'd doctor 's fees

Two sovereign herbs , which I by practice know
And both at hand ( for in our yard they grow

On peril of my soul shall rid you wholly
Of yellow choler , and of melancholy

You must both purge , and vomit ; but obey
And for the love of heaven make no delay

Since hot and dry in your complexion join
Beware the sun when in a vernal sign

For when he mounts exalted in the Ram
If then he finds your body in a flame

Replete with choler , I dare lay a groat
A tertian ague is at least your lot

Perhaps a fever ( which the gods forefend
May bring your youth to some untimely end

And therefore , sir , as you desire to live
A day or two before your laxative

Take just three worms , nor under nor above
Because the gods unequal numbers love

These digestives prepare you for your purge
Of fumetory , centaury , and spurge

And of ground ivy add a leaf or two
All which within our yard or garden grow

Eat these , and be , my lord , of better cheer
Your father 's son was never born to fear

Madam , quoth he , gramercy for your care
But Cato , whom you quoted , you may spare

'T is true , a wise and worthy man he seems
And ( as you say ) gave no belief to dreams

But other men of more authority
And , by the immortal powers ! as wise as he

Maintain , with sounder sense , that dreams forebode
For Homer plainly says they come from God

Nor Cato said it : but some modern fool
Imposed in Cato 's name on boys at school

Believe me , madam , morning dreams foreshow
The events of things , and future weal or woe

Some truths are not by reason to be tried
But we have sure experience for our guide

An ancient author , equal with the best
Relates this tale of dreams among the rest

Two friends or brothers , with devout intent
On some far pilgrimage together went

It happen 'd so that , when the sun was down
They just arrived by twilight at a town

That day had been the baiting of a bull
'T was at a feast , and every inn so full

That no void room in chamber , or on ground
And but one sorry bed was to be found

And that so little it would hold but one
Though till this hour they never lay alone

So were they forced to part ; one staid behind
His fellow sought what lodging he could find

At last he found a stall where oxen stood
And that he rather chose than lie abroad

'T was in a farther yard without a door
But , for his ease , well litter 'd was the floor

His fellow , who the narrow bed had kept
Was weary , and without a rocker slept

Supine he snored ; but in the dead of night
He dream 'd his friend appear 'd before his sight

Who , with a ghastly look and doleful cry
Said , Help me , brother , or this night I die

Arise , and help , before all help be vain
Or in an ox 's stall I shall be slain

Roused from his rest , he waken 'd in a start
Shivering with horror , and with aching heart

At length to cure himself by reason tries
'T is but a dream , and what are dreams but lies

His dream returns ; his friend appears again
The murderers come , now help , or I am slain

He dream 'd the third : but now his friend appeared
Pale , naked , pierced with wounds , with blood besmeared

Thrice warn 'd , awake , said he ; relief is late
The deed is done ; but thou revenge my fate

Tardy of aid , unseal thy heavy eyes
Awake , and with the dawning day arise

Take to the western gate thy ready way
For by that passage they my corpse convey

My corpse is in a tumbril laid , among
The filth and ordure , and enclosed with dung

That cart arrest , and raise a common cry
For sacred hunger of my gold , I die

Then show 'd his grisly wound ; and last he drew
A piteous sigh , and took a long adieu

The frighted friend arose by break of day
And found the stall where late his fellow lay

Then of his impious host inquiring more
Was answer 'd that his guest was gone before

Muttering he went , said he , by morning light
And much complain 'd of his ill rest by night

This raised suspicion in the pilgrim 's mind
Because all hosts are of an evil kind

His dream confirm 'd his thought : with troubled look
Straight to the western gate his way he took

There , as his dream foretold , a cart he found
That carried compost forth to dung the ground

This when the pilgrim saw , he stretch 'd his throat
And cried out murder with a yelling note

My murder 'd fellow in this cart lies dead
Vengeance and justice on the villain 's head

You , magistrates , who sacred laws dispense
On you I call to punish this offence

The word thus given , within a little space
The mob came roaring out , and throng 'd the place

All in a trice they cast the cart to ground
And in the dung the murder 'd body found

Good Heaven , whose darling attribute we find
Is boundless grace and mercy to mankind

Abhors the cruel ; and the deeds of night
By wondrous ways reveals in open light

Murder may pass unpunish 'd for a time
But tardy justice will o'ertake the crime

And oft a speedier pain the guilty feels
The hue and cry of Heaven pursues him at the heels

Fresh from the fact ; as in the present case
The criminals are seized upon the place

Stiff in denial , as the law appoints
On engines they distend their tortured joints

So was confession forced , the offence was known
And public justice on the offenders done

Here may you see that visions are to dread
And in the page that follows this , I read

Of two young merchants , whom the hope of gain
Induced in partnership to cross the main

Waiting till willing winds their sails supplied
Within a trading town they long abide

One evening it befell , that , looking out
The wind they long had wish 'd was come about

Well pleased , they went to rest ; and if the gale
Till morn continued , both resolved to sail

But as together in a bed they lay
The younger had a dream at break of day

A man he thought stood frowning at his side
Who warn 'd him for his safety to provide

Nor put to sea , but safe on shore abide
I come , thy Genius , to command thy stay

Trust not the winds , for fatal is the day
And death unhoped attends the watery way

The vision said ; and vanish 'd from his sight
The dreamer waken 'd in a mortal fright

Then pull 'd his drowsy neighbour , and declared
What in his slumber he had seen and heard

His friend smiled scornful , and with proud contempt
Rejects as idle what his fellow dreamt

Stay , who will stay : for me no fears restrain
Who follow Mercury , the god of gain

Let each man do as to his fancy seems
I wait , not I , till you have better dreams

Dreams are but interludes which fancy makes
When monarch Reason sleeps , this mimic wakes

Compounds a medley of disjointed things
A mob of cobblers , and a court of kings

Light fumes are merry , grosser fumes are sad
Both are the reasonable soul run mad

And many monstrous forms in sleep we see
That neither were , nor are , nor e'er can be

Sometimes forgotten things , long cast behind
Rush forward in the brain , and come to mind

The nurse 's legends are for truths received
And the man dreams but what the boy believed

Sometimes we but rehearse a former play
The night restores our actions done by day

In short , the farce of dreams is of a piece
Chimeras all ; and more absurd , or less

You , who believe in tales , abide alone
Whate'er I get this voyage is my own

Thus while he spoke , he heard the shouting crew
That call 'd aboard , and took his last adieu

The vessel went before a merry gale
And for quick passage put on every sail

But when least fear 'd , and even in open day
The mischief overtook her in the way

Whether she sprung a leak , I can not find
Or whether she was overset with wind

Or that some rock below her bottom rent
But down at once with all her crew she went

Her fellow ships from far her loss descried
But only she was sunk , and all were safe beside

By this example you are taught again
That dreams and visions are not always vain

But if , dear Partlet , you are still in doubt
Another tale shall make the former out

Kenelm , the son of Kenulph , Mercia 's king
Whose holy life the legends loudly sing

Warn 'd in a dream , his murder did foretell
From point to point as after it befell

All circumstances to his nurse he told
( A wonder from a child of seven years old

The dream with horror heard , the good old wife
From treason counsell 'd him to guard his life

But close to keep the secret in his mind
For a boy 's vision small belief would find

The pious child , by promise bound , obeyed
Nor was the fatal murder long delayed

By Quenda slain , he fell before his time
Made a young martyr by his sister 's crime

The tale is told by venerable Bede
Which , at your better leisure , you may read

Macrobius , too , relates the vision sent
To the great Scipio , with the famed event

Objections makes , but after makes replies
And adds , that dreams are often prophecies

Of Daniel you may read in holy writ
Who , when the king his vision did forget

Nor less of patriarch Joseph understand
Who by a dream enslaved the Egyptian land

The years of plenty and of dearth foretold
When , for their bread , their liberty they sold

Nor must the exalted butler be forgot
Nor he whose dream presaged his hanging lot

And did not Croesus the same death foresee
Raised in his vision on a lofty tree

The wife of Hector , in his utmost pride
Dream 'd of his death the night before he died

Well was he warn 'd from battle to refrain
But men to death decreed are warn 'd in vain

Much more I know , which I forbear to speak
For , see , the ruddy day begins to break

Let this suffice , that plainly I foresee
My dream was bad , and bodes adversity

But neither pills nor laxatives I like
They only serve to make the well-man sick

Of these his gain the sharp physician makes
And often gives a purge , but seldom takes

They not correct , but poison all the blood
And ne'er did any but the doctors good

Their tribe , trade , trinkets , I defy them all
With every work of pothecary 's hall

These melancholy matters I forbear
But let me tell thee , Partlet mine , and swear

That when I view the beauties of thy face
I fear not death , nor dangers , nor disgrace

So may my soul have bliss , as when I spy
The scarlet red about thy partridge eye

While thou art constant to thy own true knight
While thou art mine , and I am thy delight

For true it is , as _in principio
Mulier est hominis confusio_

Madam , the meaning of this Latin is
That woman is to man his sovereign bliss

For when by night I feel your tender side
Though for the narrow perch I can not ride

Yet I have such a solace in my mind
That all my boding cares are cast behind

And even already I forget my dream
He said , and downward flew from off the beam

For daylight now began apace to spring
The thrush to whistle , and the lark to sing

Then , crowing , clapp 'd his wings , the appointed call
To chuck his wives together in the hall

By this the widow had unbarr 'd the door
And Chanticleer went strutting out before

With royal courage , and with heart so light
As show 'd he scorned the visions of the night

Now roaming in the yard , he spurn 'd the ground
And gave to Partlet the first grain he found

Then often feather 'd her with wanton play
And trod her twenty times ere prime of day

And took by turns , and gave , so much delight
Her sisters pined with envy at the sight

He chuck 'd again , when other corns he found
And scarcely deign 'd to set a foot to ground

But swagger 'd like a lord about his hall
And his seven wives came running at his call

'T was now the month in which the world began
( If March beheld the first created man

And since the vernal equinox , the sun
In Aries twelve degrees , or more , had run

When , casting up his eyes against the light
Both month , and day , and hour he measured right

And told more truly than the Ephemeris
For art may err , but nature can not miss

Thus numbering times and seasons in his breast
His second crowing the third hour confessed

Then turning , said to Partlet , See , my dear
How lavish nature has adorn 'd the year

How the pale primrose and blue violet spring
And birds essay their throats disused to sing

All these are ours ; and I with pleasure see
Man strutting on two legs , and aping me

An unfledged creature , of a lumpish frame
Endow 'd with fewer particles of flame

Our dame sits cowering o'er a kitchen fire
I draw fresh air , and nature 's works admire

And even this day in more delight abound
Than , since I was an egg , I ever found

The time shall come when Chanticleer shall wish
His words unsaid , and hate his boasted bliss

The crested bird shall by experience know
Jove made not him his masterpiece below

The vessel of his bliss to dregs is run
And Heaven will have him taste his other tun

Ye wise , draw near , and hearken to my tale
Which proves that oft the proud by flattery fall

The legend is as true , I undertake
As Tristran is , and Launcelot of the lake

Which all our ladies in such reverence hold
As if in Book of Martyrs it were told

A fox , full-fraught with seeming sanctity
That fear 'd an oath , but , like the devil , would lie

Who look 'd like Lent , and had the holy leer
And durst not sin before he said his prayer

This pious cheat , that never suck 'd the blood
Nor chew 'd the flesh of lambs , but when he could

And musing long , whom next to circumvent
On Chanticleer his wicked fancy bent

And in his high imagination cast
By stratagem , to gratify his taste

The plot contrived , before the break of day
Saint Reynard through the hedge had made his way

The pale was next , but proudly with a bound
He leapt the fence of the forbidden ground

Yet fearing to be seen , within a bed
Of coleworts he conceal 'd his wily head

Then skulk 'd till afternoon , and watch 'd his time
( As murderers use ) to perpetrate his crime

Oh , hypocrite , ingenious to destroy
Oh , traitor , worse than Sinon was to Troy

Oh , vile subverter of the Gallic reign
More false than Gano was to Charlemagne

Oh , Chanticleer , in an unhappy hour
Didst thou forsake the safety of thy bower

Better for thee thou hadst believed thy dream
And not that day descended from the beam

But here the doctors eagerly dispute
Some hold predestination absolute

Some clerks maintain , that Heaven at first foresees
And in the virtue of foresight decrees

If this be so , then prescience binds the will
And mortals are not free to good or ill

For what he first foresaw , he must ordain
Or its eternal prescience may be vain

As bad for us as prescience had not been
For first , or last , he 's author of the sin

And who says that , let the blaspheming man
Say worse even of the devil , if he can

For how can that Eternal Power be just
To punish man , who sins because he must

Or , how can he reward a virtuous deed
Which is not done by us ; but first decreed

I can not bolt this matter to the bran
As Bradwardin and holy Austin can

If prescience can determine actions so
That we must do , because he did foreknow

Or that , foreknowing , yet our choice is free
Not forced to sin by strict necessity

This strict necessity they simple call
Another sort there is conditional

The first so binds the will , that things foreknown
By spontaneity , not choice , are done

Thus galley-slaves tug willing at their oar
Content to work , in prospect of the shore

That other does not liberty constrain
But man may either act , or may refrain

Heaven made us agents free to good or ill
And forced it not , though he foresaw the will

Freedom was first bestow 'd on human race
And prescience only held the second place

If he could make such agents wholly free
I not dispute , the point 's too high for me

For Heaven 's unfathom 'd power what man can sound
Or put to his Omnipotence a bound

He made us to his image , all agree
That image is the soul , and that must be

But whether it were better man had been
By nature bound to good , not free to sin

I waive , for fear of splitting on a rock
The tale I tell is only of a cock

Who had not run the hazard of his life
Had he believed his dream , and not his wife

For women , with a mischief to their kind
Pervert with bad advice our better mind

A woman 's counsel brought us first to woe
And made her man his paradise forego

Where at heart 's ease he lived ; and might have been
As free from sorrow as he was from sin

For what the devil had their sex to do
That , born to folly , they presumed to know

And could not see the serpent in the grass
But I myself presume , and let it pass

Silence in times of suffering is the best
'T is dangerous to disturb an hornet 's nest

In other authors you may find enough
But all they say of dames is idle stuff

Legends of lying wits together bound
The Wife of Bath would throw them to the ground

These are the words of Chanticleer , not mine
I honour dames , and think their sex divine

Now to continue what my tale begun
Lay Madam Partlet basking in the sun

Breast-high in sand : her sisters in a row
Enjoy 'd the beams above , the warmth below

The cock , that of his flesh was ever free
Sung merrier than the mermaid in the sea

He saw false Reynard where he lay full low
I need not swear he had no list to crow

But cried _cock , cock_ , and gave a sudden start
As sore dismay 'd , and frighted at his heart

For birds and beasts , inform 'd by nature , know
Kinds opposite to theirs , and fly their foe

So Chanticleer , who never saw a fox
Yet shunn 'd him as a sailor shuns the rocks

But the false loon , who could not work his will
But open force , employ 'd his flattering skill

I hope , my lord , said he , I not offend
Are you afraid of me , that am your friend

I were a beast indeed to do you wrong
I , who have loved and honour 'd you so long

Stay , gentle sir , nor take a false alarm
For , on my soul , I never meant you harm

I come no spy , nor as a traitor press
To learn the secrets of your soft recess

Far be from Reynard so profane a thought
But by the sweetness of your voice was brought

For , as I bid my beads , by chance I heard
The song as of an angel in the yard

A song that would have charm 'd the infernal gods
And banish 'd horror from the dark abodes

Had Orpheus sung it in the nether sphere
So much the hymn had pleased the tyrant 's ear

My lord , your sire familiarly I knew
A peer deserving such a son as you

He , with your lady-mother ( whom Heaven rest
Has often graced my house , and been my guest

To view his living features does me good
For I am your poor neighbour in the wood

And in my cottage should be proud to see
The worthy heir of my friend 's family

But since I speak of singing , let me say
As with an upright heart I safely may

That , save yourself , there breathes not on the ground
One like your father for a silver sound

So sweetly would he wake the winter day
That matrons to the church mistook their way

And he , to raise his voice , with artful care
( What will not beaux attempt to please the fair

On tiptoe stood to sing with greater strength
And stretch 'd his comely neck at all the length

And while he strain 'd his voice to pierce the skies
As saints in raptures use , would shut his eyes

That the sound striving through the narrow throat
His winking might avail to mend the note

By this , in song , he never had his peer
From sweet Cecilia down to Chanticleer

Nor Maro 's muse , who sung the mighty Man
Nor Pindar 's heavenly lyre , nor Horace when a swan

Your ancestors proceed from race divine
From Brennus and Belinus is your line

Who gave to sovereign Rome such loud alarms
That even the priests were not excused from arms

Besides , a famous monk of modern times
Has left of cocks recorded in his rhymes

That of a parish priest the son and heir
( When sons of priests were from the proverb clear

Affronted once a cock of noble kind
And either lamed his legs , or struck him blind

For which the clerk his father was disgraced
And in his benefice another placed

Now sing , my lord , if not for love of me
Yet for the sake of sweet Saint Charity

Make hills and dales , and earth and heaven rejoice
And emulate your father 's angel-voice

The cock was pleased to hear him speak so fair
And proud beside , as solar people are

Nor could the treason from the truth descry
So was he ravish 'd with this flattery

So much the more , as from a little elf
He had a high opinion of himself

Though sickly , slender , and not large of limb
Concluding all the world was made for him

Ye princes , raised by poets to the gods
And Alexander 'd [ g b ] up in lying odes

Believe not every flattering knave 's report
There 's many a Reynard lurking in the court

And he shall be received with more regard
And listen 'd to , than modest truth is heard

This Chanticleer , of whom the story sings
Stood high upon his toes , and clapp 'd his wings

Then stretch 'd his neck , and wink d with both his eyes
Ambitious as he sought the Olympic prize

But while he pain 'd himself to raise his note
False Renyard rush 'd and caught him by the throat

Then on his back he laid the precious load
And sought his wonted shelter of the wood

Swiftly he made his way the mischief done
Of all unheeded , and pursued by none

Alas , what stay is there in human state
Or who can shun inevitable fate

The doom was written , the decree was passed
Ere the foundations of the world were cast

In Aries though the sun exalted stood
His patron-planet , to procure his good

Yet Saturn was his mortal foe , and he
In Libra raised , opposed the same degree

The rays both good and bad , of equal power
Each thwarting other , made a mingled hour

On Friday morn he dreamt this direful dream
Cross to the worthy native , in his scheme

Ah , blissful Venus , Goddess of delight
How couldst thou suffer thy devoted knight

On thy own day to fall by foe oppressed
The wight of all the world who served thee best

Who , true to love , was all for recreation
And minded not the work of propagation

Ganfride , [ g c ] who couldst so well in rhyme complain
The death of Richard with an arrow slain

Why had not I thy muse , or thou my heart
To sing this heavy dirge with equal art

That I , like thee , on Friday might complain
For on that day was Coeur de Lion slain

Not louder cries , when Ilium was in flames
Were sent to Heaven by woful Trojan dames

When Pyrrhus toss 'd on high his burnish 'd blade
And offer 'd Priam to his father 's shade

Fair Partlet first , when he was borne from sight
With sovereign shrieks bewail 'd her captive knight

Far louder than the Carthaginian wife
When Asdrubal , her husband , lost his life

When she beheld the smouldering flames ascend
And all the Punic glories at an end

Willing into the fires she plunged her head
With greater ease than others seek their bed

Not more aghast the matrons of renown
When tyrant Nero burn 'd the imperial town

Shriek 'd for the downfall in a doleful cry
For which their guiltless lords were doom 'd to die

Now to my story I return again
The trembling widow , and her daughters twain

This woful cackling cry with horror heard
Of those distracted damsels in the yard

And starting up beheld the heavy sight
How Reynard to the forest took his flight

And 'cross his back , as in triumphant scorn
The hope and pillar of the house was borne

The fox ! the wicked fox ! was all the cry
Out from his house ran every neighbour nigh

The vicar first , and after him the crew
With forks and staves the felon to pursue

Ran Coll our dog , and Talbot with the band
And Malkin , with her distaff in her hand

Ran cow and calf , and family of hogs
In panic horror of pursuing dogs

With many a deadly grunt and doleful squeak
Poor swine , as if their pretty hearts would break

The shouts of men , the women in dismay
With shrieks augment the terror of the day

The ducks that heard the proclamation cried
And fear 'd a persecution might betide

Full twenty miles from town their voyage take
Obscure in rushes of the liquid lake

The geese fly o'er the barn ; the bees in arms
Drive headlong from their waxen cells in swarms

Jack Straw at London-stone , with all his rout
Struck not the city with so loud a shout

Not when , with English hate , they did pursue
A Frenchman , or an unbelieving Jew

Not when the welkin rung with 'one and all
And echoes bounded back from Fox 's hall

With might and main they chased the murderous fox
With brazen trumpets , and inflated box

To kindle Mars with military sounds
Nor wanted horns to inspire sagacious hounds

But see how Fortune can confound the wise
And when they least expect it , turn the dice

The captive-cock , who scarce could draw his breath
And lay within the very jaws of death

Yet in this agony his fancy wrought
And fear supplied him with this happy thought

Yours is the prize , victorious prince ! said he
The vicar my defeat , and all the village see

Enjoy your friendly fortune while you may
And bid the churls that envy you the prey

Call back their mongrel curs , and cease their cry
See , fools , the shelter of the wood is nigh

He shall be pluck 'd and eaten to the bone
'T is well advised , in faith it shall be done

This Reynard said : but as the word he spoke
The prisoner with a spring from prison broke

Then stretch 'd his feather 'd fans with all his might
And to the neighbouring maple wing 'd his flight

Whom , when the traitor safe on tree beheld
He cursed the gods , with shame and sorrow filled

Shame for his folly , sorrow out of time
For plotting an unprofitable crime

Yet mastering both , the artificer of lies
Renews the assault , and his last battery tries

Though I , said he , did ne'er in thought offend
How justly may my lord suspect his friend

The appearance is against me , I confess
Who seemingly have put you in distress

You , if your goodness does not plead my cause
May think I broke all hospitable laws

To bear you from your palace-yard by might
And put your noble person in a fright

This , since you take it ill , I must repent
Though , Heaven can witness , with no bad intent

I practised it , to make you taste your cheer
With double pleasure , first prepared by fear

So loyal subjects often seize their prince
Forced ( for his good ) to seeming violence

Descend ; so help me Jove , as you shall find
That Reynard comes of no dissembling kind

Nay , quoth the Cock , but I beshrew us both
If I believe a saint upon his oath

An honest man may take a knave 's advice
But idiots only may be cozen 'd twice

Once warn 'd is well bewared ; no nattering lies
Shall soothe me more to sing with winking eyes

Who blindfold walks upon a river 's brim
When he should see , has he deserved to swim

Better , Sir Cock , let all contention cease
Come down , said Reynard , let us treat of peace

A peace with all my soul , said Chanticleer
But , with your favour , I will treat it here

And , lest the truce with treason should be mixed
'T is my concern to have the tree betwixt

In this plain fable you the effect may see
Of negligence , and fond credulity

And learn besides of flatterers to beware
Then most pernicious when they speak too fair

The cock and fox , the fool and knave imply
The truth is moral , though the tale a lie

Who spoke in parables , I dare not say
But sure he knew it was a pleasing way

And in a heathen author we may find
That pleasure with instruction should be joined

Now turning from the wintry signs , the sun
His course exalted , through the Ram had run

And whirling up the skies , his chariot drove
Through Taurus , and the lightsome realms of love

Where Venus from her orb descends in showers
To glad the ground , and paint the fields with flowers

When first the tender blades of grass appear
And buds , that yet the blast of Eurus fear

Till gentle heat , and soft repeated rains
Make the green blood to dance within their veins

Then , at their call , embolden 'd out they come
And swell the gems , and burst the narrow room

Broader and broader yet , their blooms display
Salute the welcome sun , and entertain the day

Then from their breathing souls the sweets repair
To scent the skies , and purge the unwholesome air

Joy spreads the heart , and , with a general song
Spring issues out , and leads the jolly months along

In that sweet season , as in bed I lay
And sought in sleep to pass the night away

I turn 'd my weary side , but still in vain
Though full of youthful health , and void of pain

Cares I had none , to keep me from my rest
For love had never enter 'd in my breast

I wanted nothing fortune could supply
Nor did she slumber till that hour deny

I wonder 'd then , but after found it true
Much joy had dried away the balmy dew

Seas would be pools , without the brushing air
To curl the waves ; and sure some little care

When Chanticleer the second watch had sung
Scorning the scorner sleep , from bed I sprung

And dressing , by the moon , in loose array
Pass 'd out in open air , preventing day

Straight as a line in beauteous order stood
Of oaks unshorn a venerable wood

Fresh was the grass beneath , and every tree
At distance planted in a due degree

Their branching arms in air with equal space
Stretch 'd to their neighbours with a long embrace

And the new leaves on every bough were seen
Some ruddy colour 'd , some of lighter green

The painted birds , companions of the spring
Hopping from spray to spray , were heard to sing

Both eyes and ears received a like delight
Enchanting music , and a charming sight

On Philomel I fix 'd my whole desire
And listen 'd for the queen of all the quire

Fain would I hear her heavenly voice to sing
And wanted yet an omen to the spring

Attending long in vain , I took the way
Which through a path but scarcely printed lay

In narrow mazes oft it seem 'd to meet
And look 'd as lightly press 'd by fairy feet

Wandering I walk 'd alone , for still methought
To some strange end so strange a path was wrought

At last it led me where an arbour stood
The sacred receptacle of the wood

This place unmark 'd , though oft I walk 'd the green
In all my progress I had never seen

And seized at once with wonder and delight
Gazed all around me , new to the transporting sight

'T was bench 'd with turf , and goodly to be seen
The thick young grass arose in fresher green

The mound was newly made , no sight could pass
Betwixt the nice partitions of the grass

The well-united sods so closely lay
And all around the shades defended it from day

For sycamores with eglantine were spread
A hedge about the sides , a covering overhead

And so the fragrant brier was wove between
The sycamore and flowers were mixed with green

That nature seem 'd to vary the delight
And satisfied at once the smell and sight

The master workman of the bower was known
Through fairy-lands , and built for Oberon

Who twining leaves with such proportion drew
They rose by measure , and by rule they grew

No mortal tongue can half the beauty tell
For none but hands divine could work so well

Both roof and sides were like a parlour made
A soft recess , and a cool summer shade

The hedge was set so thick , no foreign eye
The persons placed within it could espy

But all that pass 'd without with ease was seen
As if nor fence nor tree was placed between

'T was border 'd with a field ; and some was plain
With grass , and some was sow 'd with rising grain

That ( now the dew with spangles deck 'd the ground
A sweeter spot of earth was never found

I look 'd , and look 'd , and still with new delight
Such joy my soul , such pleasures fill 'd my sight

And the fresh eglantine exhaled a breath
Whose odours were of power to raise from death

Nor sullen discontent , nor anxious care
Even though brought thither , could inhabit there

But thence they fled as from their mortal foe
For this sweet place could only pleasure know

Thus as I mused , I cast aside my eye
And saw a medlar-tree was planted nigh

The spreading branches made a goodly show
And full of opening blooms was every bough

A goldfinch there I saw , with gaudy pride
Of painted plumes , that hopp 'd from side to side

Still pecking as she pass 'd ; and still she drew
The sweets from every flower , and suck 'd the dew

Sufficed at length , she warbled in her throat
And tuned her voice to many a merry note

But indistinct , and neither sweet nor clear
Yet such as soothed my soul , and pleased my ear

Her short performance was no sooner tried
When she I sought , the nightingale , replied

So sweet , so shrill , so variously she sung
That the grove echoed , and the valleys rung

And I so ravish 'd with her heavenly note
I stood entranced , and had no room for thought

But all o'er-power 'd with ecstasy of bliss
Was in a pleasing dream of paradise

At length I waked , and looking round the bower
Search 'd every tree , and pry 'd on every flower

If any where by chance I might espy
The rural poet of the melody

For still methought she sung not far away
At last I found her on a laurel spray

Close by my side she sat , and fair in sight
Full in a line , against her opposite

Where stood with eglantine the laurel twined
And both their native sweets were well conjoined

On the green bank I sat , and listen 'd long
( Sitting was more convenient for the song

Nor till her lay was ended could I move
But wish 'd to dwell for ever in the grove

Only methought the time too swiftly passed
And every note I fear 'd would be the last

My sight and smell , and hearing were employed
And all three senses in full gust enjoyed

And what alone did all the rest surpass
The sweet possession of the fairy place

Single , and conscious to myself alone
Of pleasures to the excluded world unknown

Pleasures which nowhere else were to be found
And all Elysium in a spot of ground

Thus while I sat intent to see and hear
And drew perfumes of more than vital air

All suddenly I heard the approaching sound
Of vocal music on the enchanted ground

A host of saints it seem 'd , so full the quire
As if the bless 'd above did all conspire

At length there issued from the grove behind
A fair assembly of the female kind

A train less fair , as ancient fathers tell
Seduced the sons of heaven to rebel

I pass their form , and every charming grace
Less than an angel would their worth debase

But their attire , like liveries of a kind
All rich and rare , is fresh within my mind

In velvet white as snow the troop was gowned
The seams with sparkling emeralds set around

Their hoods and sleeves the same ; and purfled o'er
With diamonds , pearls , and all the shining store

Of eastern pomp : their long descending train
With rubies edged , and sapphires , swept the plain

High on their heads , with jewels richly set
Each lady wore a radiant coronet

Beneath the circles , all the quire was graced
With chaplets green on their fair foreheads placed

Of laurel some , of woodbine many more
And wreaths of Agnus castus [ g e ] others bore

These last , who with those virgin crowns were dressed
Appear 'd in higher honour than the rest

They danced around : but in the midst was seen
A lady of a more majestic mien

She in the midst began with sober grace
Her servants ' eyes were fix 'd upon her face

And as she moved or turn 'd , her motions viewed
Her measures kept , and step by step pursued

Methought she trod the ground with greater grace
With more of godhead shining in her face

And as in beauty she surpass 'd the quire
So , nobler than the rest , was her attire

A crown of ruddy gold enclosed her brow
Plain without pomp , and rich without a show

A branch of Agnus castus in her hand
She bore aloft ( her sceptre of command

Admired , adored by all the circling crowd
For wheresoe'er she turn 'd her face , they bowed

And as she danced , a roundelay she sung
In honour of the laurel , ever young

She raised her voice on high , and sung so clear
The fawns came scudding from the groves to hear

At every close she made , the attending throng
Replied , and bore the burden of the song

So just , so small , yet in so sweet a note
It seem 'd the music melted in the throat

Thus dancing on , and singing as they danced
They to the middle of the mead advanced

Till round my arbour a new ring they made
And footed it about the sacred shade

O'erjoy 'd to see the jolly troops so near
But somewhat awed , I shook with holy fear

Yet not so much , but what I noted well
Who did the most in song or dance excel

Not long I had observed , when from afar
I heard a sudden symphony of war

The neighing coursers , and the soldiers cry
And sounding trumps , that seem 'd to tear the sky

I saw soon after this , behind the grove
From whence the ladies did in order move

Come issuing out in arms a warrior train
That like a deluge pour 'd upon the plain

On barbed steeds they rode in proud array
Thick as the college of the bees in May

When swarming o'er the dusky fields they fly
New to the flowers , and intercept the sky

So fierce they drove , their coursers were so fleet
That the turf trembled underneath their feet

To tell their costly furniture were long
The summer 's day would end before the song

To purchase but the tenth of all their store
Would make the mighty Persian monarch poor

Yet what I can , I will ; before the rest
The trumpets issued , in white mantles dressed

A numerous troop , and all their heads around
With chaplets green of cerrial-oak [ g f ] were crowned

Which , waving in the wind , displayed at large
Their master 's coat of arms , and knightly charge

Broad were the banners , and of snowy hue
A purer web the silk-worm never drew

The chief about their necks the scutcheons wore
With orient pearls and jewels powder 'd o'er

Broad were their collars too , and every one
Was set about with many a costly stone

Next these , of kings-at-arms a goodly train
In proud array came prancing o'er the plain

Their cloaks were cloth of silver mix 'd with gold
And garlands green around their temples rolled

Rich crowns were on their royal scutcheons placed
With sapphires , diamonds , and with rubies graced

And as the trumpets their appearance made
So these in habits were alike arrayed

But with a pace more sober , and more slow
And twenty , rank in rank , they rode a-row

The pursuivants came next , in number more
And , like the heralds , each his scutcheon bore

Clad in white velvet all their troop they led
With each an oaken chaplet on his head

Nine royal knights in equal rank succeed
Each warrior mounted on a fiery steed

In golden armour glorious to behold
The rivets of their arms were nail 'd with gold

Their surcoats of white ermine fur were made
With cloth of gold between , that cast a glittering shade

The trappings of their steeds were of the same
The golden fringe even set the ground on flame

And drew a precious trail : a crown divine
Of laurel did about their temples twine

Three henchmen were for every knight assigned
All in rich livery clad , and of a kind

White velvet , but unshorn , for cloaks they wore
And each within his hand a truncheon bore

The foremost held a helm of rare device
A prince 's ransom would not pay the price

The second bore the buckler of his knight
The third of cornel-wood a spear upright

Like to their lords their equipage was seen
And all their foreheads crown 'd with garlands green

And after these came , arm 'd with spear and shield
A host so great as cover 'd all the field

And all their foreheads , like the knights before
With laurels ever-green were shaded o'er

Or oak , or other leaves of lasting kind
Tenacious of the stem , and firm against the wind

Some in their hands , beside the lance and shield
The boughs of woodbine , or of hawthorn held

Or branches for their mystic emblems took
Of palm , of laurel , and of cerrial-oak

Thus marching to the trumpet 's lofty sound
Drawn in two lines adverse they wheel 'd around

Among themselves the tourney they divide
In equal squadrons ranged on either side

Then turn 'd their horses ' heads , and man to man
And steed to steed opposed , the jousts began

They lightly set their lances in the rest
And , at the sign , against each other pressed

They met . I sitting at my ease beheld
The mix 'd events , and fortunes of the field

Some broke their spears , some tumbled horse and man
And round the field the lighten 'd coursers ran

An hour and more , like tides , in equal sway
They rush 'd , and won by turns , and lost the day

At length the nine ( who still together held
Their fainting foes to shameful flight compelled

Thus , to their fame , when finish 'd was the fight
The victors from their lofty steeds alight

Like them dismounted all the warlike train
And two by two proceeded o'er the plain

Till to the fair assembly they advanced
Who near the secret arbour sung and danced

The ladies left their measures at the sight
To meet the chiefs returning from the fight

Amid the plain a spreading laurel stood
The grace and ornament of all the wood

That pleasing shade they sought , a soft retreat
From sudden April showers , a shelter from the heat

Her leafy arms with such extent were spread
So near the clouds was her aspiring head

That hosts of birds , that wing the liquid air
Perch 'd in the boughs , had nightly lodging there

And flocks of sheep beneath the shade from far
Might hear the rattling hail , and wintry war

From heaven 's inclemency here found retreat
Enjoy 'd the cool , and shunn 'd the scorching heat

A hundred knights might there at ease abide
And every knight a lady by his side

The trunk itself such odours did bequeath
That a Moluccan [ g g ] breeze to these was common breath

The lords and ladies here , approaching , paid
Their homage , with a low obeisance made

These rites perform 'd , their pleasures they pursue
With song of love , and mix with measures new

Around the holy tree their dance they frame
And every champion leads his chosen dame

I cast my sight upon the farther field
And a fresh object of delight beheld

For from the region of the West I heard
New music sound , and a new troop appeared

Of knights and ladies mix 'd , a jolly band
But all on foot they march 'd , and hand in hand

The ladies dress 'd in rich symars were seen
Of Florence satin , flower 'd with white and green

The borders of their petticoats below
Were guarded thick with rubies on a row

And every damsel wore upon her head
Of flowers a garland blended white and red

Attired in mantles all the knights were seen
That gratified the view with cheerful green

Their chaplets of their ladies ' colours were
Composed of white and red , to shade their shining hair

Before the merry troop the minstrels played
All in their masters ' liveries were arrayed

And clad in green , and on their temples wore
The chaplets white and red their ladies bore

Their instruments were various in their kind
Some for the bow , and some for breathing wind

The sawtry , pipe , and hautboy 's noisy band
And the soft lute trembling beneath the touching hand

A tuft of daisies on a flowery lea
They saw , and thitherward they bent their way

To this both knights and dames their homage made
And due obeisance to the daisy paid

And then the band of flutes began to play
To which a lady sung a virelay : [ g h ]

And still at every close she would repeat
The burden of the song , _The daisy is so sweet

The daisy is so sweet_ : when she begun
The troop of knights and dames continued on

The concert and the voice so charm 'd my ear
And soothed my soul , that it was heaven to hear

But soon their pleasure pass 'd : at noon of day
The sun with sultry beams began to play

Not Sirius shoots a fiercer flame from high
When with his poisonous breath he blasts the sky

Then droop 'd the fading flowers ( their beauty fled
And closed their sickly eyes , and hung the head

The ladies gasp 'd , and scarcely could respire
The breath they drew , no longer air but fire

The fainty knights were scorch 'd , and knew not where
To run for shelter , for no shade was near

And after this the gathering clouds amain
Pour 'd down a storm of rattling hail and rain

And lightning flash 'd betwixt : the field , and flowers
Burnt up before , were buried in the showers

The ladies and the knights , no shelter nigh
Bare to the weather and the wintry sky

Were drooping wet , disconsolate , and wan
And through their thin array received the rain

While those in white , protected by the tree
Saw pass in vain the assault , and stood from danger free

But as compassion moved their gentle minds
When ceased the storm , and silent were the winds

Displeased at what , not suffering they had seen
They went to cheer the faction of the green

The queen in white array , before her band
Saluting , took her rival by the hand

So did the knights and dames , with courtly grace
And with behaviour sweet their foes embrace

Then thus the queen with laurel on her brow
Fair sister , I have suffer 'd in your woe

Nor shall be wanting aught within my power
For your relief in my refreshing bower

That other answer 'd with a lowly look
And soon the gracious invitation took

For ill at ease both she and all her train
The scorching sun had borne , and beating rain

Like courtesy was used by all in white
Each dame a dame received , and every knight a knight

The laurel champions with their swords invade
The neighbouring forests , where the jousts were made

And serewood from the rotten hedges took
And seeds of latent fire , from flints provoke

A cheerful blaze arose , and by the fire
They warm 'd their frozen feet , and dried their wet attire

Refresh 'd with heat , the ladies sought around
For virtuous herbs , which , gather 'd from the ground

They squeezed the juice , and cooling ointment made
Which on their sun-burnt cheeks , and their chapt skins they laid

Then sought green salads , which they bade them eat
A sovereign remedy for inward heat

The Lady of the Leaf ordain 'd a feast
And made the Lady of the Flower her guest

When , lo ! a bower ascended on the plain
With sudden seats ordain 'd , and large for either train

This bower was near my pleasant arbour placed
That I could hear and see whatever passed

The ladies sat with each a knight between
Distinguish 'd by their colours , white and green

The vanquish 'd party with the victors joined
Nor wanted sweet discourse , the banquet of the mind

Meantime the minstrels play 'd on either side
Vain of their art , and for the mastery vied

The sweet contention lasted for an hour
And reach 'd my secret arbour from the bower

The sun was set ; and Vesper , to supply
His absent beams , had lighted up the sky

When Philomel , officious all the day
To sing the service of the ensuing May

Fled from her laurel shade , and wing 'd her flight
Directly to the queen array 'd in white

And , hopping , sat familiar on her hand
A new musician , and increased the band

The goldfinch , who , to shun the scalding heat
Had changed the medlar for a safer seat

And hid in bushes 'scaped the bitter shower
Now perch 'd upon the Lady of the Flower

And either songster holding out their throats
And folding up their wings , renew 'd their notes

As if all day , precluding to the fight
They only had rehearsed , to sing by night

The banquet ended , and the battle done
They danced by star-light and the friendly moon

And when they were to part , the laureate queen
Supplied with steeds the lady of the green

Her and her train conducting on the way
The moon to follow , and avoid the day

This when I saw , inquisitive to know
The secret moral of the mystic show

I started from my shade , in hopes to find
Some nymph to satisfy my longing mind

And as my fair adventure fell , I found
A lady all in white , with laurel crowned

Who closed the rear , and softly paced along
Repeating to herself the former song

With due respect my body I inclined
As to some being of superior kind

And made my court according to the day
Wishing her queen and her a happy May

Great thanks , my daughter , with a gracious bow
She said ; and I , who much desired to know

Of whence she was , yet fearful how to break
My mind , adventured humbly thus to speak

Madam , might I presume and not offend
So may the stars and shining moon attend

Your nightly sports , as you vouchsafe to tell
What nymphs they were who mortal forms excel

To this the dame replied : Fair daughter , know
That what you saw was all a fairy show

And all those airy shapes you now behold
Were human bodies once , and clothed with earthly mould

Our souls , not yet prepared for upper light
Till doomsday wander in the shades of night

This only holiday of all the year
We privileged in sunshine may appear

With songs and dance we celebrate the day
And with due honours usher in the May

At other times we reign by night alone
And posting through the skies pursue the moon

But when the morn arises , none are found
For cruel Demogorgon walks the round

And if he finds a fairy lag in light
He drives the wretch before , and lashes into night

All courteous are by kind ; and ever proud
With friendly offices to help the good

In every land we have a larger space
Than what is known to you of mortal race

Where we with green adorn our fairy bowers
And even this grove , unseen before , is ours

Know farther ; every lady clothed in white
And , crown 'd with oak and laurel every knight

Are servants to the Leaf , by liveries known
Of innocence ; and I myself am one

Saw you not her , so graceful to behold
In white attire , and crown 'd with radiant gold

The sovereign lady of our land is she
Diana call 'd , the Queen of Chastity

And , for the spotless name of maid she bears
That Agnus castus in her hand appears

And all her train , with leafy chaplets crowned
Were for unblamed virginity renowned

But those the chief and highest in command
Who bear those holy branches in their hand

The knights adorn 'd with laurel crowns are they
Whom death nor danger ever could dismay

Who , while they lived , in deeds of arms excelled
And after death for deities were held

But those who wear the woodbine on their brow
Were knights of love , who never broke their vow

Firm to their plighted faith , and ever free
From fears and fickle chance , and jealousy

The lords and ladies , who the woodbine bear
As true as Tristram and Isotta were

But what are those , said I , the unconquer 'd nine
Who , crown 'd with laurel-wreaths , in golden armour shine

And who the knights in green , and what the train
Of ladies dress 'd with daisies on the plain

Why both the bands in worship disagree
And some adore the flower , and some the tree

Just is your suit , fair daughter , said the dame
Those laurell 'd chiefs were men of mighty fame

Nine worthies were they call 'd of different rites
Three Jews , three Pagans , and three Christian knights

Their temples wreathed with leaves , that still renew
For deathless laurel is the victor 's due

Who bear the bows were knights in Arthur 's reign
Twelve they , and twelve the peers of Charlemagne

For bows the strength of brawny arms imply
Emblems of valour , and of victory

Behold an order yet of newer date
Doubling their number , equal in their state

Our England 's ornament , the crown 's defence
In battle brave , protectors of their prince

Unchanged by fortune , to their sovereign true
For which their manly legs are bound with blue

These , of the Garter call 'd , of faith unstained
In fighting fields the laurel have obtained

The laurel wreaths were first by Cesar worn
And still they Cesar 's successors adorn

One leaf of this is immortality
And more of worth than all the world can buy

One doubt remains , said I , the dames in green
What were their qualities , and who their queen

Flora commands , said she , those nymphs and knights
Who lived in slothful ease and loose delights

Who never acts of honour durst pursue
The men inglorious knights , the ladies all untrue

Who , nursed in idleness , and train 'd in courts
Pass 'd all their precious hours in plays , and sports

Till death behind came stalking on , unseen
And wither 'd ( like the storm ) the freshness of their green

These , and their mates , enjoy their present hour
And therefore pay their homage to the Flower

But knights in knightly deeds should persevere
And still continue what at first they were

No room for cowardice , or dull delay
From good to better they should urge their way

For this with golden spurs the chiefs are graced
With pointed rowels arm 'd to mend their haste

For this with lasting leaves their brows are bound
For laurel is the sign of labour crowned

From winter winds it suffers no decay
For ever fresh and fair , and every month is May

Even when the vital sap retreats below
Even when the hoary head is hid in snow

The life is in the Leaf , and still between
The fits of falling snow appears the streaky green

Not so the Flower , which lasts for little space
A short-lived good , and an uncertain grace

This way , and that , the feeble stem is driven
Weak to sustain the storms and injuries of heaven

Propp 'd by the spring , it lifts aloft the head
But of a sickly beauty , soon to shed

For things of tender kind , for pleasure made
Shoot up with swift increase , and sudden are decayed

With humble words , the wisest I could frame
And proffer 'd service , I repaid the dame

That , of her grace , she gave her maid to know
The secret meaning of this moral show

And she , to prove what profit I had made
Of mystic truth , in fables first conveyed

Demanded , till the next returning May
Whether the Leaf or Flower I would obey

I chose the Leaf ; she smiled with sober cheer
And wish 'd me fair adventure for the year

And gave me charms and sigils , for defence
Against ill tongues that scandal innocence

But I , said she , my fellows must pursue
Already past the plain , and out of view

We parted thus ; I homeward sped my way
Bewilder 'd in the wood till dawn of day

Then late refresh 'd with sleep , I rose to write
The visionary vigils of the night

Blush , as thou may'st , my little book , with shame
Nor hope with homely verse to purchase fame

For such thy maker chose ; and so designed
Thy simple style to suit thy lowly kind

In days of old , when Arthur fill 'd the throne
Whose acts and fame to foreign lands were blown

The king of elves and little fairy queen
Gamboll 'd on heaths , and danced on every green

And where the jolly troop had led the round
The grass unbidden rose , and mark 'd the ground

Nor darkling did they dance , the silver light
Of Phoebe served to guide their steps aright

Her beams they follow 'd , where at full she played
Nor longer than she shed her horns they stayed

Above the rest our Britain held they dear
More solemnly they kept their sabbaths here

I speak of ancient times , for now the swain
Returning late may pass the woods in vain

In vain the dairy now with mints is dressed
The dairymaid expects no fairy guest

She sighs and shakes her empty shoes in vain
No silver penny to reward her pain

For priests , with prayers , and other godly gear
Have made the merry goblins disappear

And where they play 'd their merry pranks before
Have sprinkled holy water on the floor

And friars , that through the wealthy regions run
Thick as the motes that twinkle in the sun

Resort to farmers rich , and bless their halls
And exorcise the beds , and cross the walls

This makes the fairy quires forsake the place
When once 't is hallow 'd with the rites of grace

But in the walks where wicked elves have been
The learning of the parish now is seen

With gown tuck 'd up , to wakes , for Sunday next
With humming ale encouraging his text

From fiends and imps he sets the village free
There haunts not any incubus but he

The maids and women need no danger fear
To walk by night , and sanctity so near

For by some haycock , or some shady thorn
He bids his beads both even-song and morn

It so befell , in this King Arthur 's reign
A lusty knight was pricking o'er the plain

It happen 'd , as he rode , a damsel gay
In russet robes , to market took her way

Soon on the girl he cast an amorous eye
So straight she walk 'd , and on her pasterns high

If , seeing her behind , he liked her pace
Now turning short , he better likes her face

He lights in haste , and , full of youthful fire
By force accomplish 'd his obscene desire

This done , away he rode , not unespied
For swarming at his back the country cried

And once in view they never lost the sight
But seized , and pinion 'd brought to court the knight

Then courts of kings were held in high renown
Ere made the common brothels of the town

There , virgins honourable vows received
But chaste as maids in monasteries lived

The king himself , to nuptial ties a slave
No bad example to his poets gave

And they , not bad , but in a vicious age
Had not , to please the prince , debauch 'd the stage

Now , what should Arthur do ? He loved the knight
But sovereign monarchs are the source of right

Moved by the damsel 's tears and common cry
He doom 'd the brutal ravisher to die

But fair Geneura rose in his defence
And pray 'd so hard for mercy from the prince

That to his queen the king the offender gave
And left it in her power to kill or save

This gracious act the ladies all approve
Who thought it much a man should die for love

And with their mistress join 'd in close debate
( Covering their kindness with dissembled hate

At last agreed , they call him by consent
Before the queen and female parliament

And the fair speaker , rising from the chair
Did thus the judgment of the house declare

Sir knight , though I have ask 'd thy life , yet still
Thy destiny depends upon my will

Nor hast thou other surety than the grace
Not due to thee from our offended race

But as our kind is of a softer mould
And can not blood without a sigh behold

I grant thee life ; reserving still the power
To take the forfeit when I see my hour

Unless thy answer to my next demand
Shall set thee free from our avenging hand

The question , whose solution I require
Is , What the sex of women most desire

In this dispute thy judges are at strife
Beware ; for on thy wit depends thy life

Yet ( lest surprised , unknowing what to say
Thou damn thyself ) we give thee farther day

A year is thine to wander at thy will
And learn from others , if thou want'st the skill

But , not to hold our proffer turn 'd to scorn
Good sureties will we have for thy return

That at the time prefix 'd thou shalt obey
And at thy pledge 's peril keep thy day

Woe was the knight at this severe command
But well he knew 't was bootless to withstand

The terms accepted , as the fair ordain
He put in bail for his return again

And promised answer at the day assigned
The best , with Heaven 's assistance , he could find

His leave thus taken , on his way he went
With heavy heart , and full of discontent

'T was hard the truth of such a point to find
As was not yet agreed among the kind

Thus on he went ; still anxious more and more
Ask 'd all he met , and knock 'd at every door

Inquired of men ; but made his chief request
To learn from women what they loved the best

They answer 'd each according to her mind
To please herself , not all the female kind

One was for wealth , another was for place
Crones , old and ugly , wish 'd a better face

The widow 's wish was oftentimes to wed
The wanton maids were all for sport a-bed

Some said the sex were pleased with handsome lies
And some gross flattery loved without disguise

Truth is , says one , he seldom fails to win
Who flatters well ; for that 's our darling sin

But long attendance , and a duteous mind
Will work even with the wisest of the kind

One thought the sex 's prime felicity
Was from the bonds of wedlock to be free

Their pleasures , hours , and actions all their own
And uncontroll 'd to give account to none

Some wish a husband-fool ; but such are cursed
For fools perverse of husbands are the worst

All women would be counted chaste and wise
Nor should our spouses see , but with our eyes

For fools will prate ; and though they want the wit
To find close faults , yet open blots will hit

Though better for their ease to hold their tongue
For womankind was never in the wrong

So noise ensues , and quarrels last for life
The wife abhors the fool , the fool the wife

And some men say that great delight have we
To be for truth extoll 'd , and secrecy

And constant in one purpose still to dwell
And not our husbands ' counsels to reveal

But that 's a fable ; for our sex is frail
Inventing rather than not tell a tale

Like leaky sieves , no secrets we can hold
Witness the famous tale that Ovid told

Midas the king , as in his book appears
By Phoebus was endow 'd with ass 's ears

Which under his long locks he well concealed
( As monarchs ' vices must not be revealed

For fear the people have them in the wind
Who long ago were neither dumb nor blind

Nor apt to think from Heaven their title springs
Since Jove and Mars left off begetting kings

This Midas knew ; and durst communicate
To none but to his wife his ears of state

One must be trusted , and he thought her fit
As passing prudent , and a parlous wit

To this sagacious confessor he went
And told her what a gift the gods had sent

But told it under matrimonial seal
With strict injunction never to reveal

The secret heard , she plighted him her troth
( And sacred sure is every woman 's oath

The royal malady should rest unknown
Both for her husband 's honour and her own

But ne'ertheless she pined with discontent
The counsel rumbled till it found a vent

The thing she knew she was obliged to hide
By interest and by oath the wife was tied

Loath to betray a husband and a prince
But she must burst , or blab ; and no pretence

A marshy ground commodiously was near
Thither she ran , and held her breath for fear

Lest if a word she spoke of any thing
That word might be the secret of the king

Thus full of counsel to the fen she went
Griped all the way , and longing for a vent

Arrived , by pure necessity compelled
On her majestic marrow-bones she kneeled

Then to the water 's brink she laid her head
And as a bittour [ g i ] bumps within a reed

To thee alone , O lake , she said , I tell
( And , as thy queen , command thee to conceal

Beneath his locks the king , my husband wears
A goodly royal pair of ass 's ears

Now I have eased my bosom of the pain
Till the next longing fit return again

Thus through a woman was the secret known
Tell us , and in effect you tell the town

But to my tale ; the knight with heavy cheer
Wandering in vain , had now consumed the year

One day was only left to solve the doubt
Yet knew no more than when he first set out

But home he must , and as the award had been
Yield up his body captive to the queen

In this despairing state he happ 'd to ride
As fortune led him , by a forest side

Lonely the vale , and full of horror stood
Brown with the shade of a religious wood

When full before him , at the noon of night
( The moon was up , and shot a gleamy light

He saw a quire of ladies in a round
That featly footing seem 'd to skim the ground

Thus dancing hand in hand , so light they were
He knew not where they trod , on earth or air

At speed he drove , and came a sudden guest
In hope where many women were , at least

But faster than his horse the ladies flew
And in a trice were vanish 'd out of view

One only hag remain 'd ; but fouler far
Than grandame apes in Indian forests are

Against a wither 'd oak she lean 'd her weight
Propp 'd on her trusty staff , not half upright

Then said , What makes you , sir , so late abroad
Without a guide , and this no beaten road

Or want you aught that here you hope to find
Or travel for some trouble in your mind

The last I guess ; and if I read aright
Those of our sex are bound to serve a knight

Perhaps good counsel may your grief assuage
Then tell your pain ; for wisdom is in age

To this the knight : Good mother , would you know
The secret cause and spring of all my woe

My life must with to-morrow 's light expire
Unless I tell what women most desire

Now could you help me at this hard essay
Or for your inborn goodness , or for pay

Yours is my life , redeem 'd by your advice
Ask what you please , and I will pay the price

The proudest kerchief of the court shall rest
Well satisfied of what they love the best

Plight me thy faith , quoth she , that what I ask
Thy danger over , and perform 'd thy task

That thou shalt give for hire of thy demand
Here take thy oath , and seal it on my hand

I warrant thee , on peril of my life
Thy words shall please both widow , maid , and wife

More words there needed not to move the knight
To take her offer , and his truth to plight

With that she spread a mantle on the ground
And , first inquiring whither he was bound

Bade him not fear , though long and rough the way
At court he should arrive ere break of day

His horse should find the way without a guide
She said : with fury they began to ride

The horse what devil drove I can not tell
But only this , they sped their journey well

And all the way the crone inform 'd the knight
How he should answer the demand aright

To court they came ; the news was quickly spread
Of his returning to redeem his head

The female senate was assembled soon
With all the mob of women in the town

The queen sat lord chief-justice of the hall
And bade the crier cite the criminal

The knight appear 'd ; and silence they proclaim
Then first the culprit answer 'd to his name

And , after forms of law , was last required
To name the thing that women most desired

The offender , taught his lesson by the way
And by his counsel order 'd what to say

Thus bold began : My lady liege , said he
What all your sex desire is Sovereignty

The wife affects her husband to command
All must be hers , both money , house , and land

The maids are mistresses even in their name
And of their servants full dominion claim

This , at the peril of my head , I say
A blunt plain truth , the sex aspires to sway

There was not one , or widow , maid , or wife
But said the knight had well deserved his life

Even fair Geneura , with a blush , confessed
The man had found what women love the best

Upstarts the beldam , who was there unseen
And , reverence made , accosted thus the queen

My liege , said she , before the court arise
May I , poor wretch , find favour in your eyes

To grant my just request ? 't was I who taught
The knight this answer , and inspired his thought

None but a woman could a man direct
To tell us women what we most affect

But first I swore him on his knightly troth
( And here demand performance of his oath

To grant the boon that next I should desire
He gave his faith , and I expect my hire

My promise is fulfill 'd ; I saved his life
And claim his debt , to take me for his wife

The knight was ask 'd , nor could his oath deny
But hoped they would not force him to comply

The women , who would rather wrest the laws
Than let a sister-plaintiff lose the cause

( As judges on the bench more gracious are
And more attent to brothers of the bar

Cried one and all , the suppliant should have right
And to the grandame hag adjudged the knight

In vain he sigh 'd , and oft with tears desired
Some reasonable suit might be required

But still the crone was constant to her note
The more he spoke , the more she stretch 'd her throat

In vain he proffer 'd all his goods , to save
His body destined to that living grave

The liquorish hag rejects the pelf with scorn
And nothing but the man would serve her turn

Not all the wealth of eastern kings , said she
Have power to part my plighted love , and me

And , old and ugly as I am , and poor
Yet never will I break the faith I swore

For mine thou art by promise , during life
And I thy loving and obedient wife

My love ! nay , rather , my damnation thou
Said he : nor am I bound to keep my vow

The fiend thy sire hath sent thee from below
Else how couldst thou my secret sorrows know

Avaunt , old witch ! for I renounce thy bed
The queen may take the forfeit of my head

Both heard , the judge pronounced against the knight
So was he married in his own despite

And all day after hid him as an owl
Not able to sustain a sight so foul

Perhaps the reader thinks I do him wrong
To pass the marriage feast , and nuptial song

Mirth there was none , the man was _a-la-mort_
And little courage had to make his court

To bed they went , the bridegroom and the bride
Was never such an ill-pair 'd couple tied

Restless , he toss 'd and tumbled to and fro
And roll 'd , and wriggled further off , for woe

The good old wife lay smiling by his side
And caught him in her quivering arms , and cried

When you my ravish 'd predecessor saw
You were not then become this man of straw

Is this the custom of King Arthur 's court
Are all round-table knights of such a sort

Remember , I am she who saved your life
Your loving , lawful , and complying wife

Not thus you swore in your unhappy hour
Nor I for this return employ 'd my power

In time of need I was your faithful friend
Nor did I since , nor ever will offend

Believe me , my loved lord , 't is much unkind
What fury has possess 'd your alter 'd mind

Thus on my wedding night -- without pretence
Come turn this way , or tell me my offence

If not your wife , let reason 's rule persuade
Name but my fault , amends shall soon be made

Amends ! nay , that 's impossible , said he
What change of age or ugliness can be

Or could Medea 's magic mend thy face
Thou art descended from so mean a race

What wonder , madam , if I move my side
When , if I turn , I turn to such a bride

And is this all that troubles you so sore
And what the devil couldst thou wish me more

Ah , Benedicite , replied the crone
Then cause of just complaining have you none

The remedy to this were soon applied
Would you be like the bridegroom to the bride

But , for you say a long descended race
And wealth and dignity , and power and place

Make gentlemen , and that your high degree
Is much disparaged to be match 'd with me

Know this , my lord , nobility of blood
Is but a glittering and fallacious good

The nobleman is he , whose noble mind
Is fill 'd with inborn worth , unborrow 'd from his kind

The King of Heaven was in a manger laid
And took his earth but from an humble maid

Then what can birth , or mortal men , bestow
Since floods no higher than their fountains flow

We , who for name and empty honour strive
Our true nobility from him derive

Your ancestors , who puff your mind with pride
And vast estates to mighty titles tied

Did not your honour , but their own , advance
For virtue comes not by inheritance

If you tralineate from your father 's mind
What are you else but of a bastard kind

Do , as your great progenitors have done
And , by their virtues , prove yourself their son

No father can infuse or wit or grace
A mother comes across , and mars the race

A grandsire or a grandame taints the blood
And seldom three descents continue good

Were virtue by descent , a noble name
Could never villanise his father 's fame

But , as the first , the last of all the line
Would , like the sun , even in descending shine

Take fire , and bear it to the darkest house
Betwixt King Arthur 's court and Caucasus

If you depart , the flame shall still remain
And the bright blaze enlighten all the plain

Nor , till the fuel perish , can decay
By nature form 'd on things combustible to prey

Such is not man , who , mixing better seed
With worse , begets a base degenerate breed

The bad corrupts the good , and leaves behind
No trace of all the great begetter 's mind

The father sinks within his son , we see
And often rises in the third degree

If better luck a better mother give
Chance gave us being , and by chance we live

Such as our atoms were , even such are we
Or call it chance , or strong necessity

And thus it needs must be ; for seed conjoined
Lets into nature 's work the imperfect kind

But fire , the enlivener of the general frame
Is one , its operation still the same

Its principle is in itself : while ours
Works , as confederates war , with mingled powers

Or man or woman , which soever fails
And oft the vigour of the worse prevails

Aether with sulphur blended alters hue
And casts a dusky gleam of Sodom blue

Thus , in a brute , their ancient honour ends
And the fair mermaid in a fish descends

The line is gone ; no longer duke or earl
But , by himself degraded , turns a churl

Nobility of blood is but renown
Of thy great fathers by their virtue known

If in thy smoke it ends , their glories shine
But infamy and villanage are thine

Then what I said before is plainly showed
The true nobility proceeds from God

Nor left us by inheritance , but given
By bounty of our stars , and grace of Heaven

Thus from a captive Servius Tullius rose
Whom for his virtues the first Romans chose

Fabricius from their walls repell 'd the foe
Whose noble hands had exercised the plough

From hence , my lord , and love , I thus conclude
That though my homely ancestors were rude

Mean as I am , yet I may have the grace
To make you father of a generous race

And noble then am I , when I begin
In virtue clothed , to cast the rags of sin

If poverty be my upbraided crime
And you believe in Heaven , there was a time

When He , the great controller of our fate
Deign 'd to be man , and lived in low estate

Which He who had the world at his dispose
If poverty were vice , would never choose

Philosophers have said , and poets sing
That a glad poverty 's an honest thing

Content is wealth , the riches of the mind
And happy he who can that treasure find

But the base miser starves amidst his store
Broods on his gold , and , griping still at more

The ragged beggar , though he want relief
Has not to lose , and sings before the thief

Want is a bitter and a hateful good
Because its virtues are not understood

Yet many things , impossible to thought
Have been by need to full perfection brought

The daring of the soul proceeds from thence
Sharpness of wit , and active diligence

Prudence at once , and fortitude , it gives
And , if in patience taken , mends our lives

For even that indigence , that brings me low
Makes me myself , and Him above , to know

A good which none would challenge , few would choose
A fair possession , which mankind refuse

If we from wealth to poverty descend
Want gives to know the flatterer from the friend

If I am old and ugly , well for you
No lewd adulterer will my love pursue

Nor jealousy , the bane of married life
Shall haunt you for a wither 'd homely wife

For age and ugliness , as all agree
Are the best guards of female chastity

Yet since I see your mind is worldly bent
I 'll do my best to further your content

And therefore of two gifts in my dispose
Think ere you speak , I grant you leave to choose

Would you I should be still deform 'd and old
Nauseous to touch , and loathsome to behold

On this condition to remain for life
A careful , tender , and obedient wife

In all I can contribute to your ease
And not in deed , or word , or thought displease

Or would you rather have me young and fair
And take the chance that happens to your share

Temptations are in beauty , and in youth
And how can you depend upon my truth

Now weigh the danger with the doubtful bliss
And thank yourself , if aught should fall amiss

Sore sigh 'd the knight , who this long sermon heard
At length , considering all , his heart he cheered

And thus replied : My lady , and my wife
To your wise conduct I resign my life

Choose you for me , for well you understand
The future good and ill , on either hand

But if an humble husband may request
Provide , and order all things for the best

Yours be the care to profit , and to please
And let your subject servant take his ease

Then thus in peace , quoth she , concludes the strife
Since I am turn 'd the husband , you the wife

The matrimonial victory is mine
Which , having fairly gain 'd , I will resign

Forgive if I have said or done amiss
And seal the bargain with a friendly kiss

I promised you but one content to share
But now I will become both good and fair

No nuptial quarrel shall disturb your ease
The business of my life shall be to please

And for my beauty , that , as time shall try
But draw the curtain first , and cast your eye

He look 'd , and saw a creature heavenly fair
In bloom of youth , and of a charming air

With joy he turn 'd , and seized her ivory arm
And like Pygmalion found the statue warm

Small arguments there needed to prevail
A storm of kisses pour 'd as thick as hail

Thus long in mutual bliss they lay embraced
And their first love continued to the last

One sunshine was their life , no cloud between
Nor ever was a kinder couple seen

And so may all our lives like theirs be led
Heaven send the maids young husbands fresh in bed

May widows wed as often as they can
And ever for the better change their man

And some devouring plague pursue their lives
Who will not well be govern 'd by their wives

A parish priest was of the pilgrim train
An awful , reverend , and religious man

His eyes diffused a venerable grace
And charity itself was in his face

Rich was his soul , though his attire was poor
( As God had clothed his own ambassador

Of sixty years he seem 'd ; and well might last
To sixty more , but that he lived too fast

Refined himself to soul , to curb the sense
And made almost a sin of abstinence

Yet , had his aspect nothing of severe
But such a face as promised him sincere

Nothing reserved or sullen was to see
But sweet regards , and pleasing sanctity

With eloquence innate his tongue was armed
Though harsh the precept , yet the preacher charmed

For letting down the golden chain from high
He drew his audience upward to the sky

And oft , with holy hymns , he charm 'd their ears
( A music more melodious than the spheres

For David left him , when he went to rest
His lyre ; and after him he sung the best

He bore his great commission in his look
But sweetly temper 'd awe ; and soften 'd all he spoke

He preach 'd the joys of heaven , and pains of hell
And warn 'd the sinner with becoming zeal

He taught the gospel rather than the law
And forced himself to drive : but loved to draw

For fear but freezes minds ; but love , like heat
Exhales the soul sublime , to seek her native seat

To threats the stubborn sinner oft is hard
Wrapp 'd in his crimes , against the storm prepared

But , when the milder beams of mercy play
He melts , and throws his cumbrous cloak away

Lightning and thunder ( heaven 's artillery
As harbingers before the Almighty fly

Those but proclaim his style , and disappear
The stiller sound succeeds , and God is there

The tithes , his parish freely paid , he took
But never sued , or cursed with bell and book

With patience bearing wrong ; but offering none
Since every man is free to lose his own

The country churls , according to their kind
( Who grudge their dues , and love to be behind

The less he sought his offerings , pinch 'd the more
And praised a priest contented to be poor

Yet of his little he had some to spare
To feed the famish 'd , and to clothe the bare

For mortified he was to that degree
A poorer than himself he would not see

True priests , he said , and preachers of the Word
Were only stewards of their sovereign Lord

Nothing was theirs ; but all the public store
Intrusted riches , to relieve the poor

Who , should they steal for want of his relief
He judged himself accomplice with the thief

Wide was his parish ; not contracted close
In streets , but here and there a straggling house

Yet still he was at hand , without request
To serve the sick ; to succour the distressed

Tempting , on foot , alone , without affright
The dangers of a dark tempestuous night

All this the good old man perform 'd alone
Nor spared his pains ; for curate he had none

Nor durst he trust another with his care
Nor rode himself to Paul 's , the public fair

To chaffer for preferment with his gold
Where bishoprics and sinecures are sold

But duly watch 'd his flock , by night and day
And from the prowling wolf redeem 'd the prey

The proud he tamed , the penitent he cheered
Nor to rebuke the rich offender feared

His preaching much , but more his practice wrought
( A living sermon of the truths he taught

For this by rules severe his life he squared
That all might see the doctrine which they heard

For priests , he said , are patterns for the rest
( The gold of heaven , who bear the God impressed

But when the precious coin is kept unclean
The Sovereign 's image is no longer seen

If they be foul on whom the people trust
Well may the baser brass contract a rust

The prelate for his holy life he prized
The worldly pomp of prelacy despised

His Saviour came not with a gaudy show
Nor was his kingdom of the world below

Patience in want , and poverty of mind
These marks of Church and Churchmen he designed

The crown he wore was of the pointed thorn
In purple he was crucified , not born

They who contend for place and high degree
Are not his sons , but those of Zebedee

Not but he knew the signs of earthly power
Might well become Saint Peter 's successor

The holy father holds a double reign
The prince may keep his pomp , the fisher must be plain

Such was the saint , who shone with every grace
Reflecting , Moses'-like , his Maker 's face

God saw his image lively was expressed
And his own work , as in creation , blessed

The Tempter saw him too , with envious eye
And , as on Job , demanded leave to try

He took the time when Richard was deposed
And high and low with happy Harry closed

This prince , though great in arms , the priest withstood
Near though he was , yet not the next of blood

Had Richard , unconstrain 'd , resign 'd the throne
A king can give no more than is his own

Conquest , an odious name , was laid aside
Where all submitted , none the battle tried

The senseless plea of right by Providence
Was , by a flattering priest , invented since

And lasts no longer than the present sway
But justifies the next who comes in play

The people 's right remains ; let those who dare
Dispute their power , when they the judges are

He join 'd not in their choice , because he knew
Worse might , and often did , from change ensue

Much to himself he thought ; but little spoke
And , undeprived , his benefice forsook

Now , through the land , his cure of souls he stretched
And like a primitive apostle preached

Still cheerful ; ever constant to his call
By many follow 'd ; loved by most , admired by all

With what he begg 'd , his brethren he relieved
And gave the charities himself received

Gave , while he taught ; and edified the more
Because he showed , by proof , 't was easy to be poor

He went not with the crowd to see a shrine
But fed us , by the way , with food divine

Jack : FRiend ! if I 'm late , excuse the failing
And think , that Reasons much prevailing

Have kept me , for an house , or better
( Since I receive 'd your tempting Letter

From this dear Scene , of Joy , and Drinking
And ev'ry Licence of Free-thinking

But , tell me , who 's this rustick Fellow
That looks as Spleenatick and yellow

As if his Rev'rend Parson aw 'd him
And with Ten Precepts weekly claw 'd him

Is he ! of Parts , or Person , proper
With Men like us ! to share a Supper

To hear all Beings , prov 'd Mechanick
And Nature , resu 'd from the Panic

Tom : Be easy , Jack , and you , this Bumpkin
Shall quickly find , is good for something

Who may be moulded to our wishes
By Wine , and Wit , and sav'ry Dishes

And , if he 's Plyant , as his Name is
Well worth the case , you 'll find the Game is

In Youth , Pedantick Tutors , bred him
And with half Notions , crudely fed him

The Town , as he 'll inform you , fully
Next , turn 'd him to a Take , and Bully

The Country , since , has been his Station
Where he 's a Patriot out of Fashion

Stickles for Monarchy , and Orders
With all , that on Religion borders

On which , so shrewdly he Discourses
He Mawls sometimes , our new rais 'd Forces

But we 're uncivil -- here 's your Health Sir
'T is hop 'd you 'll pardon , we Free-thinkers

And whatsoever suits , or pleases
Or for our Profit , or our Ease is

We never baulk it , or ill breeding
Is now esteem 'd , this Frank proceeding

Plyant . I thank you , Sir , for this Instruction
Which did not need an Introduction

For all , that I shall see you practice
I will conclude , still , most exact is

I , formerly , with Wits , and Roarers
With Bully-Rocks , and bilking Scorers

Was us 'd to Herd , and call 'd a Ranter
And in the Pit , could Vizars banter

But since , reflecting on that Folly
I can no more be loud , and jolly

But fort he time to come , shall spend it
Like one , that knows he soon must end it

Yet , real Wit , that 's Chast , and Sober
Heighten 'd a little with October

Whether express 'd , in Words , or Writing
Will to my Death-Bed be delighting

Tom . Champaigne , will surely raise it faster
Believe me , who have been your Taster

A Flask of this , for your half Guinea
Will stir up all , that 's bright within ye

Support you , when enclin 'd to Sinking
And teach your Pleasure ! and Free-Thinking

Ply . Why Sir , my thoughts were never bounded
But still , have all the Globe surrounded

Recall 'd the past , and reach 'd the future
Unhelp 'd by such a costly Tutor

But this Free-Thinking , pray what is it
If Wit , methinks I would not miss it

Or see again , my Native Mansion
Unlearn 'd , in any new Invention

And sure , a Cant , will bear rehearsal
Which is become so universal

That even the Drawer , ( to my admiring
Answer 'd me , when you for you inquiring

You wou 'd be here , I need not doubt you
Free-Thinkers , cou 'd not live without you

That Table 's his , quote he , depend o n't
He always sits at th'upper end o n't

And talks such wonders , to the Youngsters
They know not if they 're Men , or Monsters

But yet , of this , ( so clear 't is stated
They 're sure , they never were Created

But first sprung up , they know not where
Now when , nor how . 'Twill make you stare

To hear him , ( whilst they do adore him
Make Fools of all , that went before him

A Dam'sel next , both Young and Pretty
Cry 'd , welcome Land-Lord to this City

And clapp 'd me roundly on the Shoulder
No Army Trull , was ever bolder

And , when I ask 'd her , who had taught her
Such Impudence , and hither brought her

She answer 'd ( mincing in her manners
Free-Thinkers , Sir ! I thank their Honours

Which makes me find , you 've condescended
By every Rank , to be attended

And your new Doctrine ( Grave , or Frolick
Has spread , as if 'twere Apostolick

Tom . We have indeed , the World enlightened
And Boys , and Girls , are not so frightened

With God , and Evi , ( taught at random
In Nurseries by Palsied Gran-am

As heretofore , were Men , and Matrons
Free-thinking , Sir , has mighty Patrons

Ply . But may an honest Man relie o n't
Tom . Jack , Here 's a Health to Lady Plyant

Methinks , she seldom comes to Town , Sir
Ply . Why , 't is so hard , to get her down , Sir

But , this Free-thinking , pray explain it
For , if a Man should over strain it

What sees at first , but Whim , and Notion
May , Clash with Honour , and Devotion

With Magna Charta , or Superiors
And make us think , there 's no Inferiors

But all were born upon the Level
And equally should sway , and Revel

Jack . Intolerable ! Can you like him
Tom . He 'll soon be Drunk , and then we 'll strike him

Unfold our latitude Opinions
And add him , to our large Dominions

Tom . Your Son , your Second
He a Free-Thinker has been reckoned

A Man of wond'rou sense , and Mettal
Fit to unhinge , and then resettle

To lose the Bands , whch Education
Imposes , on a free born Nation

To show , how Life shou 'd slide along
Unheeding hwat 's to come , or gone

How self ! we always shou 'd consider
And follow still the fairest Bidder

Snatch in the nick the Good that 's certain
Nor mind , what 's hid behind the Curtain

Ply . Why , if you mean young Richard Plyant
He shall scale Heaven with any Gyant

Who of Lycurgus talks , and Solon
And is old Dog , at Dobbs and Toland

Knows all Republican Defences
And Raves on Cato Uticensis

With t'other of that Name , and Brutus
He daily labours to confute us

When Adam dug , and Eve set Onions
He says , that all Men were Companions

That Kings were made but for the People
As for the Church was made the Steeple

Which , tho ' it highest stands , and fair is
To make them meet , its only Care is

And , whilst that Noise , and Pomp possesses
The People 't is , must lay the Cesses

That 't is , but as the People bawl
Unto whose share , the Ropes should fall

And when it sinks , by Age , or Weather
The People , must erect another

Tom . Perfect Allusion ! strong , and valid
I ne'er heard Argument so solid

Why here 's a Lad , all Flame and Spirit
Sir Disinherit ! Disinherit

Leave not the Eldest born , an Acre
But raise this generous Undertaker

In London let him still be gallant
And much with us , to mend his Talent

Encourag 'd by our daring Papers
And growling , talk of Spleen , and Vapors

With Equipage , and Gold enough
And let him be interr 'd in Snuff

And Smyrna for his House be noted
And he , for early News , be quoted

Which , if contested , let a Wager
Profusely big , cofute th'Engager

Ply . How Dick ! . have all , have Giles offended
Tom . No , but your Race will thus be mended

Hereditary , is a Jest Sir
Right 's in the strongest , and the Best Sir

Let Dick ascend , or if the Females
Do in your Line , outvalue the Males

There , give the Land , and great match'em

Tho ' Moll coul 'd spend a mighty Fortune
And for Supplies does still Importune

Is grown a Writer and a Rattler
And ev'ry Moment , quotes the Tattler

To Opera 's , she sweekly Flutters
And mirlst [ sic ] her talking , Verses sputters

And , when I bid her leave that Tone
She sings , I 'll live for you alone

I tell her , that she goes too fine
She sings , * * * Oh ! Nymph of Race Divine

I chanc 'd to read upon her Toe
She singing , scream 'd out , Cupid Oh

Besides , the Charge each time she hears it
Wou 'd buy a Shift , her Mother swears it

Jack . She 's a Free-Thinker , I imagine
And all that 's witty does engage in

But her last Fault you 'll see amended
For Opera 's will soon be ended

Since Ridicule , that 's so subduing
Has now contriv 'd it 's total Ruin

And though , indeed , it bore the Proof
Of * * * * Bread and Butter round the Loaf

And still kept ground , before our Plays
Though hack 'd and hew 'd , by Poet +Bays

A waggish Title now must blast it
And Punch 's Opera will cast it

Ply . I am glad 'twill down , but why that Tool
Is reason , less then Ridicule

Jack . Oh Sir , by much ! all Mortals fear it
And neither Man , nor Brute can bear it

When I 've but then my Finger pointed
And with screw 'd Looks my Face dis-jointed

My Dog , I have uneasy seen
Tom . Jack , you forget , he 's a Machine

Jack . There is a * * * * * Tract ! I 'll say no more
But , had they Rally 'd heretofore

We had not been misled and fettered
Some Days kept plain , and some red Lettered

But , in full Liberty , had trod still
Ply . And Heathn Idols , been our Gods still

Yet , when lewd Wit , Thersites wasted
All that he got , was to be basted

Nor , wou 'd the Greeks , have lost Elysium
Shou 'd he have held it in Derision

Tho ' Brittons , woul 'd it seems have given
For smart Buffooning , all their Heaven

Jack . They had reign 'd to Ridiculing
Ply . And wittily been damn 'd for fooling

Jack .. Make that , the Subject of your Laughter
There 's nothing Sir to come hereafter

Tom . Free-Thinking , rescues from that Error
Which keeps you in this constant Terror

Ply . Why them , what you , Free-thinking call
I find , is not to Think at all

And Savages , through want of breeding
Are what you grow , by dint of reading

My Carter saw my Father buried
And as to Earth , his Corps was carried

Farewel quoth he , my good old Master
You , and your mare who dyed last Easter

Shall now , no more , know joys , or flashes
But be , for ever , Dust and Ashes

Tom . Well said , brave Hobb ! is such Free-thinking
Down , to the dull Plebean Sinking

And so the Clowns , talk at this rate too
Ply . Then Fools , were Socrates , and Plato

Though once esteem 'd both , wise and great
For tracing out , a Future State

Jack . Wou 'd you be still , then so confined
Nor free in Body , nor in Mind

Ply . Why Sir , were I all Air , or Fire
What freedom more cou 'd I desire

Wo 'd not with others Rights make bold
And what 's my own , is all Free-hold

Tom . But , where 's the Taste , in such posessing
The Pleasure , sure , is in Transgressing

In doing , what another dare not
And showing , we , for Statutes care not

Were I , but stronger than my Neighbours
I 'd reap the Fruit , of all their Labours

A Fellow , that with-held his Wife
'Cause by the Priest , bestow 'd for Life

Should instantly be sack 'd , and plundered
And us 'd the worst , in all the Hundred

Had I a Naboth , on each side me
Wh had a Field , or Grove , deny 'd me

In that , my Team , by force shou 'd enter
And this , shou 'd warm my Hearth in Winter

The Church , if to my House 'was joyned
Shou 'd with my Orange Trees , be lined

The Parson , if she still wou 'd keep it
Should trim the Boughs , and dayly sweep it

His Surplice , in true Blue being dyed
Shou 'd Aprons for the Work provide

Jack . Those Fellows , are indeed a burden
And shou 'd to Plough , or to the Garden

Who 're always Preaching low Submission
And clog the paths , to bold Ambition

Ply . But , for this vigorous Employment
This self providing , this Enjoyment

I can discern no proper Season
Unless brought in , by War , and Treason

And , I have still , been wond'rous loath
To violate the Allegiance Oath

Tom . Sir , I am much surpriz 'd , at finding
You think a trivial Oath , so binding

Swearing in Taverns , or the Temple
Differ but only in th'Example

One leads the Mob , to soar , and Hector
T'other , to sneak to some Protector

For Men of Sense , 't was ne'er intended
But , for the Countenance they lend it

Ply . Yet , in my Thought , there one thing more is
Are you , Free-Thinkers , Whiggs or Tories

Jack . They steadily , indeed , are neither
Occasionally , can be either

Distinction , their large Aim , disgraces
They 're of no Party , but for Places

Scorning all Ties , Divine or Civil
Ply . Why this Free-Thinking is the Devil

But yet I fear , that whilst I 'm trying
With this new Scheme , to be complying

I shall some Book , be turning over
With Clasps , and Turky-Leather Cover

Which I 'll not name ( aw 'd by my Betters
As 't is Entitl 'd in Gold Letters

Jack . You 'll never stick at those Abuses
We 've put that Book , to such odd Uses

That is has lost its ancient Credit
Though few amongst us ever read it

Ply . Well Gentlemen , I must be trudging
As far as Lombard Street 's my Lodging

Where I have plac 'd Five Hundred Pounds
The Product of my Pasture Ground

And must make hast , so to dispose it
That Bankrupts , may not sink , or lose it

Tom . You 're for the city , Sir too late
They 've long e 're this , barr 'd ev'ry Gate

And are each Lane , and Passage guarding
As safe , as if they fear 'd Bombarding

Let me , this Night , your Presence borrow
Ply . The Money must be paid to morrow

'Twixt Eight , and Nine , it is appointed
Tom . You are not with their Ways acquainted

They 'll make you wait till Twelve , or one
Before this Business can be done

And , you 're not well , yet , of your Journey
Give me your Letter of Attorney

I 'll take the Drudgery of staying
And when 't is ready for conveying

Dispatch my Man , to give you warning
Who may til then , sleep out the Morning

Come , own the Truth , did not my Lady
Cry , be as careful Dear , as may be

And , with her kind , controwling Powers
Engage you to observe good Hours

Then , since to night , you have transgressed
You must to morrow , take your rest

Jack . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Keep him waking
Kind Fortune , and his Hand from shaking

Ply . There , 't is perform 'd , now I 'll to Bed , Sir
Tom . You have an able Hand , and Head Sir

No Secretary e'er was quicker
Ply . I do best still in my Liquor

Jack . Waiter , a Coach ! the Knight is winking
He 'll wake , instructed in Free-thinking

Tom . Why , if he thoroughly has learnt it
The summ is large , but we have earn 'd it

For he 'll so fast his stock be raising
Beyond the ways , of Plough and Grazing

That he 'll have Cause to bless the Minute
And those , who did inform him in it

Mean while , towards Holland I 'll be jogging
. Jack . So you had need for fear of dogging

Or being with that Toledo haunted
Nay , prethee Thomas , be not daunted

Tom . Not daunted , when you talk of Murder
What if in this we went no further

Jack . Not any thing , wou 'd them , come of it
And the Attempt , without the Profit

Wou 'd wrong the Judgment of Free-thinkers
Tom . Great Wits , from Dangers have been Shrinkers

Therefore 't is fix 'd , I 'll not pursue it
Take you the Note , and boldly do it

Who domineer , 'till shunn 'd , and dreaded
As if a Legion you had headed

Then , sure you 're Valiant at the bottom
Jack . I 'll share the Pounds , when you have got 'em

But all Free-thinkers in the Nation
Know our first Rule 's Self-preservation

For once our Life cut short below
( Although we seem to brave it so

As Merc'ry travell 'd thro ' a Wood
( Whose Errands are more Fleet than Good

An Elephant before him lay
That much encumber 'd had the Way

The Messenger , who 's still in haste
Wou 'd fain have bow 'd , and so have past

When up arose th ' unweildy Brute
And wou 'd repeat a late Dispute

In which ( he said ) he 'd gain 'd the Prize
From a wild Boar of monstrous Size

But Fame ( quoth he ) with all her Tongues
Who Lawyers , Ladies , Soldiers wrongs

Has , to my Disadvantage , told
An Action throughly Bright and Bold

Has said , that I foul Play had used
And with my Weight th ' Opposer bruised

Had laid my Trunk about his Brawn
Before his Tushes cou 'd be drawn

Had stunn 'd him with a hideous Roar
And twenty-thousand Scandals more

But I defy the Talk of Men
Or Voice of Brutes in ev'ry Den

Th ' impartial Skies are all my Care
And how it stands Recorded there

Amongst you Gods , pray , What is thought
Quoth MercuryÃ¢â‚¬ â€œ Then have you Fought

Solicitous thus shou 'd I be
For what 's said of my Verse and Me

Or shou 'd my Friends Excuses frame
And beg the Criticks not to blame

Defects in Judgment , or in Wit
They 'd but reply - Then has she Writ

Our Vanity we more betray
In asking what the World will say

Than if , in trivial Things like these
We wait on the Event with ease

Nor make long Prefaces , to show
What Men are not concern 'd to know

For still untouch 'd how we succeed
'T is for themselves , not us , they Read

Whilst that proceeding to requite
We own ( who in the Muse delight

Betray 'd by Solitude to try
Amusements , which the Prosp'rous fly

And only to the Press repair
To fix our scatter 'd Papers there

Tho ' whilst our Labours are preserved
The Printers may , indeed , be starved

To flying Posts , that haste away
To Plants , that fade with the declining Day

Till by Extention into that they flow
Or , scatt'ring on the World below

To Autumn-leaves , which every Wind can chace
To rising Bubbles , on the Waters Face

When the returning Rays of Light
Resuming their alternate Right

Bestow 'd whilst in the vale of Tears below
But this unhappy Truth , at last to know

Neither in thoughtless Sleep opprest
Nor poison 'd with a tainted Breast

A studious Boy , advanc 'd beyond his Age
Wastes the dim Lamp , and turns the restless Page

For some lov 'd Book prevents the rising Day
And on it , stoln aside , bestows the Hours of Play

Him the observing Master do 's design
For search of darkned Truths and Mysteries Divine

The Rise of Empires , and their various Fates
The several Tyrants o'er the several States

Bids him in Paradice the Bank survey
Where Man , new-moulded from the temper 'd Clay

Could he be led thus far -- -What were the Boast
What the Reward of all the Toil it cost

What from that Land of ever-blooming Spring
For our Instruction could he bring

Unless , that having Humane Nature found
Unseparated from its Parent Ground

The lothsome Beggar , that before
His rude unhospitable Door

Ere he can in the Learned Sphere arise
A guilding Star , attracting to the Skies

Sends him , perhaps , to Death 's concealing Shade
Where , in the Marble Tomb now silent laid

He better do 's that useful Doctrine show
( Which all the sad Assistants ought to know

Who round the Grave his short continuance mourn
That first from Dust we came , and must to Dust return

A bolder Youth , grown capable of Arms
Bellona courts with her prevailing Charms

Loud as Triumph , soft as Love
Striking now the Poles above

'Gainst the loudest Terrors Proof
Pawing the Valley with his steeled Hoof

Who on the th ' advanced Foe , ( the Signal giv'n
Flies , like a rushing Storm by mighty Whirlwinds driv'n

Lays open the Records of Fame
No glorious Deed omits , no Man of mighty Name

Their Stratagems , their Tempers she 'll repeat
From Alexander 's , ( truly stil 'd the GREAT

From CÃƒÂ¦sar 's on the World 's Imperial Seat
To Turenne 's Conduct , and to Conde 's Heat

The safe , but harder Labours of the Gown
The softer pleasures of the Courtly Town

Does with the Soldier 's Life the Garb assume
The gold Embroid'ries , and the graceful Plume

Walks haughty in a Coat of Scarlet Die
A Colour well contriv 'd to cheat the Eye

And oh ! too near that wretched Fate attends
Hear it ye Parents , all ye weeping Friends

Thou fonder Maid ! won by these gaudy Charms
( The destin 'd Prize of his Victorious Arms

Now fainting Dye upon the mournful Sound
That speaks his hasty Death , and paints the fatal Wound

March in a slow Procession from afar
Ye silent , ye dejected Men of War

For see ! where on the Bier before ye lies
The pale , the fall'n , th ' untimely Sacrifice

Tho ' in its proud , and transitory Sway
The coldest Hearts and wisest Heads obey

Tho ' grave Seleucus ! to thy Royal Side
By holy Vows fair Stratonice be tyed

Too often gazes thy unwary Son
Till past all Hopes , expiring and undone

A speaking Pulse the secret Cause impart
The only time , when the Physician 's Art

A Queen , at his Tribunal to be tryed
A Queen that arm 'd in Beauty , shall deride

O'er the still Waves her burnisht Galley moves
Row 'd by the Graces , whilst officious Loves

To silken Cords their busie Hands apply
Or gathering all the gentle Gales that fly

To their fair Mistress with these Spoils repair
And from their purple Wings disperse the balmy Air

Hov'ring Perfumes ascend in od'rous Clouds
Curl o'er the Barque , and play among the Shrouds

With tuneful Instruments designed
To soften , and subdue the stubborn Mind

In midst of the transporting Scene
( Which Pen or Pencil imitates in vain

On a resplendent and conspicuous Bed
With all the Pride of Persia loosely spread

Which but discern 'd from the yet distant Shore
Th ' amazed Emperor could hate no more

No more a baffled Vengeance could pursue
But yielding still , still as she nearer drew

When Cleopatra anchor 'd in the Bay
Where every Charm cou 'd all its Force display

Where end the Triumphs of this conqu'ring Face
Envy 'd of Roman Wives , and all the Female Race

From near Captivity and Shame
The vanquish 'd , the abandon 'd Dame

To the destructive Snake 's more just Embrace
And courts deforming Death , to mend his Leaden Pace

Th ' immortal Streams that from Parnassus flow
Shall make his never-fading Lawrels grow

When late revolving Ages shall consume
The very Pillars , that support his Tomb

Now planting , with mistaken Care
Round thy enchanted Palace in the Air

A Grove , which in thy Fancy time shall raise
A Grove of soaring Palms , and everlasting Bays

Could'st Thou alas ! to such Reknown arrive
As thy Imagination wou 'd contrive

Struggle for thy famous Birth
Should the sole Monarch of the conquer 'd Earth

Amongst th ' inspired tuneful Race
The highest Room , the undisputed Place

Have thy proud Work to a new People shown
Th ' unequal 'd Poems made their own

As on his Labours Dryden now bestows
As now from Dryden 's just Improvement flows

What Benefit alas ! would to thee grow
What Sense of Pleasure wou'dst thou know

What swelling Joy ? what Pride ? what Glory have
When in the Darkness of the abject Grave

No Atom of thy Heap , no Dust wou 'd move
For all the airy Breath that form 'd thy Praise above

The Pleasure which to that belongs
The Feasts , th ' o'erflowing Bowls , the Mirth , the Songs

The Orange-Bloom , that with such Sweetness blows
Anacreon 's celebrated Rose

As for the gay Demetrius were designed
Where a new Sun of radiant Diamonds shined

With a transparent Sea were seen
A Sea composed of the Em'rald 's Green

And with a golden Shore encompass 'd round
Where every Orient Shell , of wondrous shape was found

The whole Creation with his Wish complyed
Did swiftly , for each Appetite provide

No less , th ' Assyrian Prince enjoyed
Of Bliss too soon depriv 'd , but never cloyed

Whose Counsel let us still pursue
Whose Monument , did this Inscription shew

Where , with a slighting Hand , and scornful Smile
The proud Effigies , on th ' instructive Pile

A great Example lay
I , here Entomb 'd , did mighty Kingdoms sway

Thou wand'ring Traveller , no longer gaze
No longer dwell upon this useless Place

Go Feed , and Drink , in Sports consume thy Life
For All that else we gain 's not worth a Moment 's Strife

Thus ! talks the Fool , whom no Restraint can bound
When now the Glass has gone a frequent round

When soaring Fancy lightly swims
Fancy , that keeps above , and dances o'er the Brims

Adds to his Own , an artificial Fire
Doubling ev'ry hot Desire

The Stomach 's Magazine defy
That standing Pool , that helpless Moisture nigh

When to the Under-world despis 'd he goes
A pamper 'd Carcase on the Worms bestows

Who rioting on the unusual Chear
As good a Life enjoy , as he could boast of here

Exhaust not thy declining Force
Nor in a long , pursu 'd , and breathless Course

Attempt , with slacken 'd speed , to run
Through ev'ry Vanity beneath the Sun

That of all Vanities beside
Which thine , or his Experience e'er have tryed

Of an ambitious , restless Mind
That can no Ease , no Satisfaction find

Till neighb'ring States are to Subjection brought
Till Universal Awe , enslav 'd Mankind is taught

For whose still necessary Use
Th ' extended Earth cou 'd not enough produce

Bewail 'd those Numbers , which his Sword employed
And false , Hyena-like , lamented and destroyed

A Windsor or Versailles erect
And thorough all Posterity expect

Tell Him , Judea 's Temple is no more
Upon whose Splendour , Thousands heretofore

Tell him , into the Earth agen is hurled
That most stupendious Wonder of the World

By humane Art and Industry designed
This ! the rich Draught of the Immortal Mind

Remember then , to fix thy Aim on High
Project , and build on t'other side the Sky

For , after all thy vain Expence below
Thou canst no Fame , no lasting Pleasure know

Or thou from that be in a Moment caught
Thy Spirit to new Claims , new Int'rests brought

Whilst unconcern 'd thy secret Ashes lye
Or stray about the Globe , O Man ordain 'd to Dye

A Female , to a Drunkard marryed
When all her other Arts miscarryed

Had yet one Stratagem to prove him
And from good Fellowship remove him

Finding him overcome with Tipple
And weak , as Infant at the Nipple

She to a Vault transports the Lumber
And there expects his breaking Slumber

A Table she with Meat provided
And rob 'd in Black , stood just beside it

Seen only , by one glim'ring Taper
That blewly burnt thro ' misty Vapor

At length he wakes , his Wine digested
And of her Phantomship requested

To learn the Name of that close Dwelling
And what offends his Sight and Smelling

And of what Land she was the Creature
With outspread Hair , and ghastly Feature

Mortal , quoth she , ( to Darkness hurryed
Know , that thou art both Dead and Buryed

Convey 'd , last Night , from noisie Tavern
To this thy still , and dreary Cavern

What strikes thy Nose , springs from the Shatters
Of Bodies kill 'd with Cordial Waters

Stronger than other Scents and quicker
As urg 'd by more spirituous Liquor

My self attend on the Deceased
When all their Earthly Train 's released

And in this Place of endless Quiet
My Bus'ness is , to find them Diet

To shew all sorts of Meats , and Salades
Till I 'm acquainted with their Palates

But that once known , then less suffices
Quoth he ( and on his Crupper rises

Thou Guardian of these lower Regions
Thou Providor for countless Legions

Thou dark , but charitable Crony
Far kinder than my Tisiphony

Who of our Victuals thus art Thinking
If thou hast Care too of our Drinking

A Bumper fetch : Quoth she , a Halter
Since nothing less thy Tone can alter

Or break this Habit thou'st been getting
To keep thy Throat in constant wetting

Where is that World , to which the Fancy flies
When Sleep excludes the Present from our Eyes

Whose Map no Voyager cou 'd e'er design
Nor to Description its wild Parts confine

Yet such a Land of Dreams We must allow
Who nightly trace it , tho ' we know not how

Unfetter 'd by the Days obtruded Rules
We All enjoy that Paradise of Fools

And find a Sorrow , in resuming Sense
Which breaks some free Delight , and snatches us from thence

Thus ! in a Dream , a Musselman was shown
A Vizir , whom he formerly had known

When at the Port he bore deputed Sway
And made the Nations with a Nod obey

Now all serene , and splendid was his Brow
Whilst ready Waiters to his Orders bow

His Residence , an artful Garden seemed
Adorn 'd with all , that pleasant he esteemed

Full of Reward , his glorious Lot appeared
As with the Sight , our Dreamer 's Mind was cheared

But turning , next he saw a dreadful Sight
Which fill 'd his Soul with Wonder and Affright

Pursu 'd by Fiends , a wretched Dervis fled
Through scorching Plains , which to wide Distance spread

Whilst every Torture , gloomy Poets paint
Was there prepar 'd for the reputed Saint

Amaz 'd at this , the sleeping Turk enquires
Why He that liv 'd above , in soft Attires

We 're taught the Suff'rings of this Future State
Th ' Excess of Courts is likeliest to create

Whilst solitary Cells , o'ergrown with Shade
The readiest way to Paradise is made

True , quoth the Phantom ( which he dream 'd replyed
The lonely Path is still the surest Guide

For , know my Friend , whatever Fame report
The Vizier to Retirements wou 'd resort

Was seated on the shadow 'd Grass
Near which a flowing Stream did pass

For sure , quoth he , each Fish must have
Who do 's not seek to be thy Slave

And if , when you behold her Face
You e'er desire to quit the Place

More easie to be caught
If so , I have my Bagpipe here

That Phillis , tho ' not up she rose
Kept time with every thrilling Close

Their frozen Blood , it seems , cou 'd thaw
Nor all they heard , nor all they saw

And from his Shoulder throws the Net
Resolv 'd he wou 'd a Supper get

Who grow more Stubborn when Carest
Or with soft Rhetorick addrest

Reputation , Love , and Death
( The Last all Bones , the First all Breath

The Midd'st compos 'd of Restless Fire
From each other wou 'd Retire

Thro ' the World resolv 'd to stray
Every One a several Way

Exercising , as they went
Each such Power , as Fate had lent

Which , if it united were
Wretched Mortals cou 'd not bear

But as parting Friends do show
To what Place they mean to go

Correspondence to engage
Nominate their utmost Stage

Death declar 'd he wou 'd be found
Near the fatal Trumpet 's sound

Or where Pestilences reign
And Quacks the greater Plagues maintain

Shaking still his sandy Glass
And mowing Human Flesh , like Grass

Love , as next his Leave he took
Cast on both so sweet a Look

As their Tempers near disarmed
One relax 'd , and t'other warmed

Shades for his Retreat he chose
Rural Plains , and soft Repose

Where no Dowry e'er was paid
Where no Jointure e'er was made

No Ill Tongue the Nymph perplexed
Where no Forms the Shepherd vexed

Where Himself shou 'd be the Care
Of the Fond and of the Fair

Where that was , they soon should know
Au Revoir ! then turn 'd to Go

Reputation made a Pause
Suiting her severer Laws

Second Thoughts , and Third she used
Weighing Consequences mused

When , at length to both she cryed
You Two safely may Divide

To th ' Antipodes may fall
And re-ascend th ' encompast Ball

Certain still to meet agen
In the Breasts of tortur 'd Men

Who by One ( too far ) betrayed
Call in t'other to their Aid

Whilst I Tender , Coy , and Nice
Rais 'd and ruin 'd in a Trice

Either fix with those I grace
Or abandoning the Place

No Return my Nature bears
From green Youth , or hoary Hairs

If thro ' Guilt , or Chance , I sever
I once Parting , Part for ever

Two long had Lov 'd , and now the Nymph desired
The Cloak of Wedlock , as the Case required

Urg 'd that , the Day he wrought her to this Sorrow
He Vow 'd , that he wou 'd marry her To-Morrow

Agen he Swears , to shun the present Storm
That he , To-Morrow , will that Vow perform

The Morrows in their due Successions came
Impatient still on Each , the pregnant Dame

When tir 'd at length , and meaning no Redress
But yet the Lye not caring to confess

He for his Oath this Salvo chose to borrow
That he was Free , since there was no To-Morrow

For when it comes in Place to be employed
'T is then To-Day ; To-Morrow 's ne'er enjoyed

The Tale 's a Jest , the Moral is a Truth
To-Morrow and To-Morrow , cheat our Youth

In riper Age , To-Morrow still we cry
Not thinking , that the present Day we Dye

Unpractis 'd all the Good we had Designed
There 's No To-Morrow to a Willing Mind

That the World may ne'er invade
Through such Windings and such Shade

No Intruders thither come
Who visit , but to be from home

None who their vain Moments pass
Only studious of their Glass

News , that charm to listning Ears
That false Alarm to Hopes and Fears

That common Theme for every Fop
From the Statesman to the Shop

In those Coverts ne'er be spread
Of who 's Deceas 'd , or who 's to Wed

Be no Tidings thither brought
But Silent , as a Midnight Thought

Where the World may ne'er invade
Be those Windings , and that Shade

Courteous Fate ! afford me there
A Table spread without my Care

With what the neighb'ring Fields impart
Whose Cleanliness be all it 's Art

When , of old , the Calf was drest
( Tho ' to make an Angel 's Feast

In the plain , unstudied Sauce
Nor Treufle , nor Morillia was

Nor cou 'd the mighty Patriarch 's Board
One far-fetch 'd Ortolane afford

Courteous Fate , then give me there
Only plain , and wholesome Fare

Fruits indeed ( wou 'd Heaven bestow
All , that did in Eden grow

All , but the Forbidden Tree
Wou 'd be coveted by me

Grapes , with Juice so crouded up
As breaking thro ' the native Cup

Figs ( yet growing ) candy 'd o'er
By the Sun 's attracting Pow ' r

Cherries , with the downy Peach
All within my easie Reach

Whilst creeping near the humble Ground
Shou 'd the Strawberry be found

Springing wheresoe'er I strayed
Thro ' those Windings and that Shade

For my Garments ; let them be
What may with the Time agree

Warm , when Phoebus does retire
And is ill-supply 'd by Fire

But when he renews the Year
And verdant all the Fields appear

Beauty every thing resumes
Birds have dropt their Winter-Plumes

When the Lilly full displayed
Stands in purer White arrayed

Than that Vest , which heretofore
The Luxurious ( a ) Monarch wore

When from Salem 's Gates he drove
To the soft Retreat of Love

Lebanon 's all burnish 'd House
And the dear Egyptian Spouse

Cloath me , Fate , tho ' not so Gay
Cloath me light , and fresh as May

In the Fountains let me view
All my Habit cheap and new

Such as , when sweet Zephyrs fly
With their Motions may comply

Gently waving , to express
Unaffected Carelessness

No Perfumes have there a Part
Borrow 'd from the Chymists Art

But such as rise from flow'ry Beds
Or the falling Jasmin Sheds

'T was the Odour of the Field
Esau 's rural Coat did yield

That inspir 'd his Father 's Pray ' r
For Blessings of the Earth and Air

Of Gums , or Pouders had it smelt
The Supplanter , then unfelt

Easily had been descryed
For One that did in Tents abide

For some beauteous Handmaids Joy
And his Mother 's darling Boy

Let me then no Fragrance wear
But what the Winds from Gardens bear

In such kind , surprizing Gales
As gather 'd from ( b ) Fidentia 's Vales

All the Flowers that in them grew
Which intermixing , as they flew

In wreathen Garlands dropt agen
On Lucullus , and his Men

Who , chear 'd by the victorious Sight
Trebl 'd Numbers put to Flight

Let me , when I must be fine
In such natural Colours shine

Wove , and painted by the Sun
Whose resplendent Rays to shun

When they do too fiercely beat
Let me find some close Retreat

Where they have no Passage made
Thro ' those Windings , and that Shade

Give me there ( since Heaven has shown
It was not Good to be alone

A Partner suited to my Mind
Solitary , pleas 'd and kind

Who , partially , may something see
Preferr 'd to all the World in me

Slighting , by my humble Side
Fame and Splendor , Wealth and Pride

When but Two the Earth possest
'T was their happiest Days , and best

They by Bus'ness , nor by Wars
They by no Domestick Cares

From each other e'er were drawn
But in some Grove , or flow'ry Lawn

Spent the swiftly flying Time
Spent their own , and Nature 's Prime

In Love ; that only Passion given
To perfect Man , whilst Friends with Heaven

Rage , and Jealousie , and Hate
Transports of his fallen State

( When by Satan 's Wiles betrayed
Fly those Windings , and that Shade

Thus from Crouds , and Noise removed
Let each Moment be improved

Every Object still produce
Thoughts of Pleasure , and of Use

When some River slides away
To encrease the boundless Sea

Think we then , how Time do 's haste
To grow Eternity at last

By the Willows , on the Banks
Gather 'd into social Ranks

Playing with the gentle Winds
Strait the Boughs , and smooth the Rinds

Moist each Fibre , and each Top
Wearing a luxurious Crop

Let the time of Youth be shown
The time alas ! too soon outgrown

Whilst a lonely stubborn Oak
Which no Breezes can provoke

No less Gusts persuade to move
Than those , which in a Whirlwind drove

Spoil 'd the old Fraternal Feast
And left alive but one poor Guest

Rivell 'd the distorted Trunk
Sapless Limbs all bent , and shrunk

Sadly does the Time presage
Of our too near approaching Age

When a helpless Vine is found
Unsupported on the Ground

Careless all the Branches spread
Subject to each haughty Tread

Bearing neither Leaves , nor Fruit
Living only in the Root

Back reflecting let me say
So the sad Ardelia lay

Blasted by a Storm of Fate
Felt , thro ' all the British State

Fall'n , neglected , lost , forgot
Dark Oblivion all her Lot

Faded till Arminda 's Love
( Guided by the Pow'rs above

Warm 'd anew her drooping Heart
And Life diffus 'd thro ' every Part

Mixing Words , in wise Discourse
Of such Weight and wond'rous Force

As could all her Sorrows charm
And transitory Ills disarm

Chearing the delightful Day
When dispos 'd to be more Gay

With Wit , from an unmeasured Store
To Woman ne'er allow 'd before

What Nature , or refining Art
All that Fortune cou 'd impart

Heaven did to Arminda send
Then gave her for Ardelia 's Friend

To her Cares the Cordial drop
Which else had overflow 'd the Cup

So , when once the Son of Jess
Every Anguish did oppress

Hunted by all kinds of Ills
Like a Partridge on the Hills

Trains were laid to catch his Life
Baited with a Royal Wife

From his House , and Country torn
Made a Heathen Prince 's Scorn

Fate , to answer all these Harms
Threw a Friend into his Arms

Friendship still has been designed
The Support of Human-kind

The safe Delight , the useful Bliss
The next World 's Happiness , and this

Give then , O indulgent Fate
Give a Friend in that Retreat

( Tho ' withdrawn from all the rest
Still a Clue , to reach my Breast

Let a Friend be still conveyed
Thro ' those Windings , and that Shade

Where , may I remain secure
Waste , in humble Joys and pure

A Life , that can no Envy yield
Want of Affluence my Shield

Thus , had Crassus been content
When from Marius Rage he went

With the Seat that Fortune gave
The commodious ample Cave

Form 'd , in a divided Rock
By some mighty Earthquake 's Shock

Into Rooms of every Size
Fair , as Art cou 'd e'er devise

Leaving , in the marble Roof
( 'Gainst all Storms and Tempests proof

Only Passage for the Light
To refresh the chearful Sight

Whilst Three Sharers in his Fate
On th ' Escape with Joy dilate

Beds of Moss their Bodies bore
Canopy 'd with Ivy o'er

Rising Springs , that round them played
O'er the native Pavement strayed

When the Hour arriv 'd to Dine
Various Meats , and sprightly Wine

On some neighb'ring Cliff they spyed
Every Day a-new supplyed

By a Friend 's entrusted Care
Had He still continu 'd there

Made that lonely wond'rous Cave
Both his Palace , and his Grave

Peace and Rest he might have found
( Peace and Rest are under Ground

Nor have been in that Retreat
Fam 'd for a Proverbial Fate

In pursuit of Wealth been caught
And punish 'd with a golden Draught

Nor had ( d ) He , who Crowds cou 'd blind
Whisp'ring with a snowy Hind

Made 'em think that from above
( Like the great Imposter 's Dove

Tydings to his Ears she brought
Rules by which he march 'd and fought

After Spain he had o'er-run
Cities sack 'd , and Battles won

Drove Rome 's Consuls from the Field
Made her darling Pompey yield

At a fatal , treacherous Feast
Felt a Dagger in his Breast

Had he his once-pleasing Thought
Of Solitude to Practice brought

Had no wild Ambition swayed
In those Islands had he stayed

Justly call 'd the Seats of Rest
Truly ( e ) Fortunate , and Blest

By the ancient Poets giv'n
As their best discover 'd Heav'n

Let me then , indulgent Fate
Let me still , in my Retreat

From all roving Thoughts be freed
Or Aims , that may Contention breed

Nor be my Endeavours led
By Goods , that perish with the Dead

Fitly might the Life of Man
Be indeed esteem 'd a Span

If the present Moment were
Of Delight his only Share

If no other Joys he knew
Than what round about him grew

But as those , who Stars wou 'd trace
From a subterranean Place

Through some Engine lift their Eyes
To the outward , glorious Skies

So th ' immortal Spirit may
When descended to our Clay

From a rightly govern 'd Frame
View the Height , from whence she came

To her Paradise be caught
And things unutterable taught

Given me then , in that Retreat
Give me , O indulgent Fate

For all Pleasures left behind
Contemplations of the Mind

Let the Fair , the Gay , the Vain
Courtship and Applause obtain

Let th ' Ambitious rule the Earth
Let the giddy Fool have Mirth

Give the Epicure his Dish
Ev'ry one their sev'ral Wish

Whilst my Transports I employ
On that more extensive Joy

When all Heaven shall be surveyed
From those Windings and that Shade

When Poets gave their God in Crete a Birth
Then Jupiter held Traffick with the Earth

And had a Farm to Lett : the Fine was high
For much the Treas'ry wanted a Supply

But Merc'ry , who as Steward kept the Court
So rack 'd the Rent , that all who made Resort

Unsatisfy 'd return 'd , nor could agree
To use the Lands , or pay his secret Fee

'Till one poor Clown ( thought subt'ler than the rest
Thro ' various Projects rolling in his Breast

Consents to take it , if at his Desire
All Weathers tow'rds his Harvest may conspire

The Frost to kill the Worm , the brooding Snow
The filling Rains may come , and Phoebus glow

The Terms accepted , sign 'd and seal 'd the Lease
His Neighbours Grounds afford their due Encrease

Whilst the new Tenant , anxious in his Mind
Now asks a Show ' r , now craves a rustling Wind

The Sun , th ' o'er-shadowing Clouds , the moistning Dews
He with such Contrariety does chuse

So often and so oddly shifts the Scene
Whilst others Load , he scarce has what to Glean

O Jupiter ! with Famine pinch 'd he cries
No more will I direct th ' unerring Skies

No more my Substance on a Project lay
No more a sullen Doubt I will betray

Fortune well-Pictur 'd on a rolling Globe
With waving Locks , and thin transparent Robe

A Man beholding , to his Neighbor cryed
Whoe'er would catch this Dame , must swiftly ride

Mark , how she seems to Fly , and with her bears
All that is worth a busie Mortal 's Cares

The gilded Air about her Statue shines
As if the Earth had lent it all her Mines

At random Here a Diadem she flings
And There a scarlet Hat with dangling Strings

Shall I then stay at Home , Dull and Content
With Quarter-Days , and hard extorted Rent

No , I 'll to Horse , to Sea , to utmost Isles
But I 'll encounter her propitious Smiles

Whilst you in slothful Ease may chuse to Sleep
And scarce the few Paternal Acres keep

Farewel , reply 'd his Friend , may you advance
And grow the Darling of this Lady Chance

Whilst I indeed , not courting of her Grace
Shall dwell content , in this my Native Place

Hoping I still shall for your Friend be known
But if too big for such Acquaintance grown

I sha n't be such a fond mistaken Sot
To think Remembrance should become my Lot

Nor me Ambitious ever shall you find
Or hunting Fortune , who , they say , is Blind

But if her Want of Sight shou 'd make her Stray
She shou 'd be Welcome , if she came this way

'T is very like ( the Undertaker cryed
That she her steps to these lost Paths shou 'd guide

Away he goes , with Expectation cheared
But when his Course he round the World had steered

Yet cou 'd not be inform 'd where he might find
This fickle Mistress of all Human-kind

He quits at length the Chace of flying Game
And back as to his Neighbor 's House he came

Who lighting from her gaudy Coach in haste
To him her eager Speeches thus addrest

Fortune behold , who has been long pursued
Whilst all the Men , that have my Splendors viewed

Madly enamour 'd , have such Flatt'ries forged
And with such Lies their vain Pretensions urged

That Hither I am fled to shun their Suits
And by free Choice conclude their vain Disputes

Whilst I the Owner of this Mansion bless
And he unseeking Fortune shall possess

Tho ' rightly charg 'd as something Dark of Sight
Yet Merit , when 't is found , is my Delight

To Knaves and Fools , when I 've some Grace allowed
'T has been like scattering Money in a Croud

To make me Sport , as I beheld them strive
And some observ 'd ( thro ' Age ) but Half-alive

Scrambling amongst the Vigorous and Young
One proves his Sword , and One his wheedling Tongue

Whilst Crowns , and Crosiers in the Contest hurled
Shew 'd me a Farce in the contending World

Thou wert deluded , whilst with Ship , or Steed
Thou lately didst attempt to reach my Speed

And by laborious Toil , and endless Pains
Didst sell thy Quiet for my doubtful Gains

Whilst He alone my real Fav'rite rises
Who every Thing to its just Value prizes

A brazen Pot , by scouring vext
With Beef and Pudding still perplext

Resolv 'd t ' attempt a nobler Life
Urging the Jugg to share the Strife

Brother , quoth he , ( Love to endear
Why shou 'd We Two continue here

Who tho ' we move with awkward pace
Your stony Bowels , and my Face

Then let us instantly be going
And see what in the World is Doing

The bloated Jugg , supine and lazy
Who made no Wish , but to be easy

Nor , like it 's Owner , e'er did think
Of ought , but to be fill 'd with Drink

Yet something mov 'd by this fine Story
And frothing higher with Vain-glory

Reply 'd , he never wanted Metal
But had not Sides , like sturdy Kettle

That in a Croud cou 'd shove and bustle
And to Preferment bear the Justle

When the first Knock would break His Measures
And stop his Rise to Place and Treasures

Sure ( quoth the Pot ) thy Scull is thicker
Than ever was thy muddiest Liquor

Go I not with thee , for thy Guard
To take off Blows , and Dangers ward

And hast thou never heard , that Cully
Is borne thro ' all by daring Bully

Your self ( reply 'd the Drink-conveigher
May be my Ruin and Betrayer

A Superiority you boast
And dress the Meat , I but the Toast

Than mine your Constitution 's stronger
And in Fatigues can hold out longer

And shou 'd one Bang from you be taken
I into Nothing shou 'd be shaken

A d'autre cry 'd the Pot in scorn
Dost think , there 's such a Villain born

That , when he proffers Aid and Shelter
Will rudely fall to Helter-Skelter

No more , but follow to the Road
Where Each now drags his pond'rous Load

And up the Hill were almost clambered
When ( may it ever be remembered

Down rolls the Jugg , and after rattles
The most perfidious of all Kettles

At every Molehill gives a Jump
Nor rests , till by obdurate Thump

The Pot of Stone , to shivers broken
Sends each misguided Fool a Token

To show them , by this fatal Test
That Equal Company is best

THUS Tapistry of old , the Walls adorned
Ere noblest Dames the artful Shuttle scorned

Arachne , then , with Pallas did contest
And scarce th ' Immortal Work was judg 'd the Best

Nor valorous Actions , then , in Books were fought
But all the Fame , that from the Field was brought

Whilst sharing in the Toil , she shar 'd the Fame
And with the Heroes mixt her interwoven Name

No longer , Females to such Praise aspire
And seldom now We rightly do admire

So much , All Arts are by the Men engrossed
And Our few Talents unimprov 'd or crossed

Even I , who on this Subject wou 'd compose
Which the fam 'd Urbin for his Pencil chose

( And here , in tinctur 'd Wool we now behold
Correctly follow 'd in each Shade , and Fold

Shou 'd prudently from the Attempt withdraw
But Inclination proves the stronger Law

And tho ' the Censures of the World pursue
These hardy Flights , whilst his Designs I view

My burden 'd Thoughts , which labour for a Vent
Urge me t'explain in Verse , what by each Face is meant

Of SERGIUS first , upon his lofty Seat
With due Regard our Observations treat

Who , whilst he thence on ELYMAS looks down
Contracts his pensive Brow into a Frown

With Looks inquistive he seeks the Cause
Why Nature acts not still by Natures Laws

'T was but a Moment , since the Sorcerer 's Sight
Receiv 'd the Day , and blaz 'd infernal Light

Untouch 'd , the Optiques in a Moment failed
Their fierce Illumination quench 'd , or veiled

Throughout th ' Extention of his ample Sway
No Fact , like this , the Roman cou 'd survey

Who , with spread Hands , invites Mankind to gaze
And sympathize in the profound Amaze

To share his Wonder every one combines
By diff'rent Aspects shewn , and diff'rent Signs

A comely Figure , near the Consul placed
With serious Mildness and Instruction graced

To Others seems imparting what he saw
And shews the Wretch with reverential Awe

Whilst a more eager Person next we find
Viewing the Wizard with a Skeptic 's Mind

Who his fixt Eyes so near him do 's apply
We think , enliv'ning Beams might from them fly

To re-inkindle , by so just an Aim
The radial Sparks , but lately check 'd and tame

But dire Surprize th ' Enquiry do 's succeed
Whilst full Conviction in his Face we read

To sacred PAUL a younger Figure guides
With seeming Warmth , which still in Youth presides

And pointing forward , Elder Men directs
In Him , to note the Cause of these Effects

Upon whose Brow do 's evidently shine
Deputed Pow ' r , t ' inflict the Wrath Divine

Whilst sad and solemn , suited to their Years
Each venerable Countenance appears

Where , yet we see Astonishment revealed
Tho ' by the Aged often 't is concealed

Who the Emotions of their Souls disguize
Lest by admiring they shou 'd seem less Wise

But to thy Portrait , ELYMAS , we come
Whose Blindness almost strikes the Poet dumb

And whilst She vainly to Describe thee seeks
The Pen but traces , where the Pencil speaks

Of Darkness to be felt , our Scriptures write
Thou Darken 'd seem'st , as thou would'st feel the Light

And with projected Limbs , betray'st a Dread
Of unseen Mischiefs , levell 'd at thy Head

Thro ' all thy Frame such Stupefaction reigns
As Night it self were sunk into thy Veins

Nor by the Eyes alone thy Loss we find
Each Lineament helps to proclaim thee Blind

An artful Dimness far diffus 'd we grant
And failing seem all Parts through One important Want

Oh ! Mighty RAPHAEL , justly sure renowned
Since in thy Works such Excellence is found

No Wonder , if with Nature Thou'rt at strife
Who thus can paint the Negatives of Life

And Deprivation more expressive make
Than the most perfect Draughts , which Others take

Whilst to this Chiefest Figure of the Piece
All that surround it , Heightnings do encrease

In some , Amazement by Extreams is shewn
Who viewing his clos 'd Lids , extend their Own

Nor can , by that , enough their Thoughts express
Which op'ning Months seem ready to confess

Thus stand the LICTORS gazing on a Deed
Which do 's all humane Chastisements exceed

Enfeebl 'd seem their Instruments of smart
When keener Words can swifter Ills impart

Thou , BARNABAS , though Last , not least our Care
Seem'st equally employ 'd in Praise , and Prayer

Acknowledging th ' Omnipotent Decree
Yet soft Compassion in thy Face we see

Whilst lifted Hands implore a kind Relief
Tho ' no Impatience animates thy Grief

But mild Suspence and Charity benign
Do all th ' excesses of thy Looks confine

Thus far , our slow Imagination goes
Wou 'd the more skill 'd THEANOR his disclose

Expand the Scene , and open to our Sight
What to his nicer Judgement gives Delight

Whose soaring Mind do 's to Perfections climb
Nor owns a Relish , but for Things sublime

Then , wou 'd the Piece fresh Beauties still present
Nor Length of Time wou 'd leave the Eye content

As moments , Hours ; as Hours the Days wou 'd seem
Observing here , taught to observe by HIM

NOW spent the alter 'd King , in am'rous Cares
The Hours of sacred Hymns and solemn Pray'rs

In vain the Alter waits his slow returns
Where unattended Incense faintly burns

In vain the whisp'ring Priests their Fears express
And of the Change a thousand Causes guess

Heedless of all their Censures He retires
And in his Palace feeds his secret Fires

Impatient , till from Rabbah Tydings tell
That near those Walls the poor Uriah fell

Led to the Onset by a Chosen Few
Who at the treacherous Signal , soon withdrew

Nor to his Rescue e'er return 'd again
Till by fierce Ammon 's Sword they saw the Victim slain

'T is pass 'd , 't is done ! the holy Marriage-Knot
Too strong to be unty 'd , at last is cut

And now to Bathsheba the King declares
That with his Heart , the Kingdom too is hers

That Israel 's Throne , and longing Monarch 's Arms
Are to be fill 'd but with her widow 'd Charms

Nor must the Days of formal Tears exceed
To cross the Living , and abuse the Dead

This she denies ; and signs of Grief are worn
But mourns no more than may her Face adorn

Give to those Eyes , which Love and Empire fired
A melting Softness more to be desired

Till the fixt Time , tho ' hard to be endured
Was pass 'd , and a sad Consort 's Name procured

When , with the Pomp that suits a Prince 's Thought
By Passion sway 'd , and glorious Woman taught

A Queen she 's made , than Michal seated higher
Whilst light unusual Airs prophane the hallow 'd Lyre

Where art thou Nathan ? where 's that Spirit now
Giv'n to brave Vice , tho ' on a Prince 's Brow

In what low Cave , or on what Desert Coast
Now Virtue wants it , is thy Presence lost

But lo ! he comes , the Rev'rend Bard appears
Defil 'd with Dust his awful silver Hairs

The King this mark 'd , and conscious wou 'd have fled
The healing Balm which for his Wounds was shed

Till the more wary Priest the Serpents Art
Join 'd to the Dove-like Temper of his Heart

Hear me , the Cause betwixt two Neighbors hear
Thou , who for Justice dost the Sceptre bear

Help the Opprest , nor let me weep alone
For him , that calls for Succour from the Throne

Good Princes for Protection are Adored
And Greater by the Shield , than by the Sword

This clears the Doubt , and now no more he fears
The Cause his Own , and therefore stays and hears

When thus the Prophet : Ã¢â‚¬ â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ â€œ In a flow'ry Plain
A King-like Man does in full Plenty reign

Casts round his Eyes , in vain , to reach the Bound
Which Jordan 's Flood sets to his fertile Ground

Countless his Flocks , whilst Lebanon contains
A Herd as large , kept by his numerous Swains

That fill with morning Bellowings the cool Air
And to the Cedar 's shade at scorching Noon repair

Near to this Wood a lowly Cottage stands
Built by the humble Owner 's painful Hands

Fenc 'd by a Stubble-roof , from Rain and Heat
Secur 'd without , within all Plain and Neat

A Field of small Extent surrounds the Place
In which One single Ewe did sport and graze

This his whole Stock , till in full time there came
To bless his utmost Hopes , a snowy Lamb

Which , lest the Season yet too Cold might prove
And Northern Blasts annoy it from the Grove

Or tow'ring Fowl on the weak Prey might sieze
( For with his Store his Fears must too increase

He brings it Home , and lays it by his Side
At once his Wealth , his Pleasure and his Pride

Still bars the Door , by Labour call 'd away
And , when returning at the Close of Day

With One small Mess himself , and that sustains
And half his Dish it shares , and half his slender Gains

When to the great Man 's table now there comes
A Lord as great , follow 'd by hungry Grooms

For these must be provided sundry Meats
The best for Some , for Others coarser Cates

One Servant , diligent above the rest
To help his Master to contrive the Feast

Extols the Lamb was nourished with such Care
So fed , so lodg 'd , it must be Princely Fare

In haste he sends , led by no Law , but Will
Not to entreat , or purchase , but to Kill

The Messenger 's arriv 'd : the harmless Spoil
Unus 'd to fly , runs Bleating to the Toil

Whilst for the Innocent the Owner feared
And , sure wou 'd move , cou 'd Poverty be heard

Oh spare ( he cries ) the Product of my Cares
My Stock 's Encrease , the Blessing on my Pray'rs

My growing Hope , and Treasure of my Life
More was he speaking , when the murd'ring Knife

Shew 'd him , his Suit , tho ' just , must be denyed
And the white Fleece in its own Scarlet dyed

Whilst the poor helpless Wretch stands weeping by
And lifts his Hands for Justice to the Sky

Which he shall find , th ' incensed King replies
When for the proud Offence th ' Oppressor dies

O Nathan ! by the Holy Name I swear
Our Land such Wrongs unpunished shall not bear

To whom the Prophet , closing with the Time
Thou art the Man replies , and thine th ' ill-natur 'd Crime

Nor think , against thy Place , or State , I err
A Pow ' r above thee does this Charge prefer

Urg 'd by whose Spirit , hither am I brought
T ' expostulate his Goodness and thy Fault

To lead thee back to those forgotten Years
In Labour spent , and lowly Rustick Cares

When in the Wilderness thy Flocks but few
Thou didst the Shepherd 's simple Art pursue

Till wondring Jesse saw six Brothers past
And Thou Elected , Thou the Least and Last

A Sceptre to thy Rural Hand conveyed
And in thy Bosom Royal Beauties laid

A lovely Princess made thy Prize that Day
When on the shaken Ground the Giant lay

Stupid in Death , beyond the Reach of Cries
That bore thy shouted Fame to list'ning Skies

And drove the flying Foe as fast away
As Winds , of old , Locusts to Egypt 's Sea

Thy Heart with Love , thy Temples with Renown
Th ' All-giving Hand of Heav'n did largely crown

What more cou 'd craving Man of God implore
Or what for favour 'd Man cou 'd God do more

Yet cou 'd not These , nor Israel 's Throne , suffice
Intemp'rate Wishes , drawn thro ' wand'ring Eyes

One Beauty ( not thy own ) and seen by chance
Melts down the Work of Grace with an alluring Glance

Chafes the Spirit , fed by sacred Art
And blots the Title AFTER GOD 'S OWN HEART

Black Murder breeds to level at his Head
Who boasts so fair a Part'ner of his Bed

Nor longer must possess those envy 'd Charms
The single Treasure of his House , and Arms

Giving , by this thy Fall , cause to Blaspheme
To all the Heathen the Almighty Name

For which the Sword shall still thy Race pursue
And , in revolted Israel 's scornful View

Thy captiv 'd Wives shall be in Triumph led
Unto a bold Usurper 's shameful Bed

Who from thy Bowels sprung shall seize thy Throne
And scourge thee by a Sin beyond thy own

Thou hast thy Fault in secret Darkness done
But this the World shall see before the Noonday 's Sun

Enough ! the King , enough ! the Saint replies
And pours his swift Repentance from his Eyes

Falls on the Ground , and tears the Nuptial Vest
By which his Crime 's Completion was exprest

Then with a Sigh blasting to Carnal Love
Drawn deep as Hell , and piercing Heaven , above

Let Me ( he cries ) let Me attend his Rod
For I have sinn 'd , for I have lost my God

Hold ! ( says the Prophet ) of that Speech beware
God ne'er was lost , unless by Man 's Despair

The Wound that is thus willingly revealed
Th ' Almighty is as willing should be healed

Thus wash 'd in Tears , thy Soul as fair does show
As the first Fleece , which on the Lamb does grow

Yet to the World that Justice may appear
Acting her Part impartial , and severe

The Offspring of thy Sin shall soon resign
That Life , for which thou must not once repine

But with submissive Grief his Fate deplore
And bless the Hand , that does inflict no more

Shall I then pay but Part , and owe the Whole
My Body 's Fruit , for my offending Soul

Shall I no more endure ( the King demands
And 'scape thus lightly his offended Hands

Oh ! let him All resume , my Crown , my Fame
Reduce me to the Nothing , whence I came

Call back his Favours , faster than he gave
And , if but Pardon 'd , strip me to my Grave

Since ( tho ' he seems to Lose ) He surely Wins
Who gives but earthly Comforts for his Sins

WHY , to our Wonder , in this Place is seen
Thus discompos 'd , and alter 'd , Juda 's Queen

May we demand , what Terrors seize your Breast
Or , why your Steps are to this House addrest

Where your unguarded Person stands exposed
To secret Foes , within its Walls inclosed

Can it be thought that you remit that Hate
No more ! but Both observe what I relate

Not , that I mean ( recalling Times of Blood
To make you Judges of the Paths I trod

When to the empty 'd Throne I boldly rose
Treating all Intercepters as my Foes

'T was Heav'ns Decree , that I should thus succeed
Whose following Favour justifies the Deed

Extending my unlimited Command
From Sea to Sea o'er the obedient Land

Whilst your Jerusalem all Peace enjoys
Nor now the ' encroaching Philistine destroys

Nor wandring Arab his Pavilion spreads
Near Jordan 's Banks , nor wastes his flow'ry Meads

The great Assyrian , Terror of your Kings
Who bought his Friendship with their holiest Things

Yields that a Sister , of his pow'rful Race
Should sway these Realms , and dignify the Place

Nor need we add the late insulting Foe
The furious Jehu does this Sceptre know

And sinks beneath the Load of conscious Fears
When in Samaria he my Actions hears

Distrest by Foes , which I 've against him raised
He sees me unmolested , fix 'd , and pleased

At least , till now thus glorious was my State
But something 's threatned from relaxing Fate

And the last Night , which should have brought me Rest
Has all these great Ideas dispossest

A Dream , a Vision , an apparent View
Of what , methinks , does still my Steps pursue

Hangs on my pensive Heart , and bears it down
More than the weight of an objected Crown

My Mother ( be the Name with Rev'rence spoke
Ere chearful Day thro ' horrid Shades had broke

Approach 'd my Bed , magnificent her Dress
Her Shape , her Air did Jesabel confess

Nor seem 'd her Face to have refus 'd that Art
Which , in despight of Age , does Youth impart

And which she practis 'd , scorning to decay
Or to be vanquish 'd ev'n in Nature 's way

Thus all array 'd , in such defying Pride
As when th ' injurious Conqu'ror she descryed

To me she spake , these Accents to me came
`` Thou worthy Daughter of my soaring Fame

`` Tho ' with a more transcendent Spirit filled
`` Tho ' struggling Pow'rs attempt thy Life to shield

`` The Hebrew 's God ( Oh , tremble at the sound
`` Shall Thee and Them , and all their Rights confound

A pitying Groan concludes , no Word of Aid
My Arms I thought to throw about the Shade

Of that lov 'd Parent , but my troubled Sight
No more directed them to aim aright

Nor ought presented , but a heap of Bones
For which fierce Dogs contended on the Stones

With Flakes of mangled Flesh , that quiv'ring still
Proclaim 'd the Freshness of the suffer 'd Ill

Distain 'd with Blood the Pavement , and the Wall
Appear 'd as in that memorable FallÃ¢â‚¬ â€œ

Oh ! just avenging Heaven
Sure , Dreams like these are for Prevention given

Thou Proteus to abus 'd Mankind
Who never yet thy real Cause cou 'd find

Now a Dead Sea thou'lt represent
A Calm of stupid Discontent

Trembling sometimes thou dost appear
Dissolv 'd into a Panick Fear

On Sleep intruding dost thy Shadows spread
Thy gloomy Terrours round the silent Bed

Or , when the Midnight Hour is told
And drooping Lids thou still dost waking hold

Before them antick Spectres dance
Unusual Fires their pointed Heads advance

When Brutus ( now beneath his Cares opprest
And all Rome 's Fortunes rolling in his Breast

Before Philippi 's latest Field
Before his Fate did to Octavius lead

Falsly , the Mortal Part we blame
Of our deprest , and pond'rous Frame

Which , till the First degrading Sin
Let Thee , its dull Attendant , in

Still with the Other did comply
Nor clogg 'd the Active Soul , dispos 'd to fly

Whilst Man his Paradice possest
His fertile Garden in the fragrant East

Cou 'd shock the Sense , or in the Face
A flusht , unhandsom Colour place

Now the Jonquille o'ercomes the feeble Brain
We faint beneath the Aromatick Pain , [ a ]

Till some offensive Scent thy Pow'rs appease
And Pleasure we resign for short , and nauseous Ease

In ev'ry One thou dost possess
New are thy Motions , and thy Dress

Now in some Grove a list'ning Friend
Thy false Suggestions must attend

Thy whisper 'd Griefs , thy fancy 'd Sorrows hear
Breath 'd in a Sigh , and witness 'd by a Tear

Whilst in the light , and vulgar Croud
Thy Slaves , more clamorous and loud

In Clouds to the attractive Brain
Until descending thence again

He the disputed Point must yield
Something resign of the contested Field

Til Lordly Man , born to Imperial Sway
Compounds for Peace , to make that Right away

The Fool , to imitate the Wits
Complains of thy pretended Fits

And Dulness , born with him , wou 'd lay
Upon thy accidental Sway

Because , sometimes , thou dost presume
Into the ablest Heads to come

Impatient of unequal Sence
Such slow Returns , where they so much dispense

O'er me , alas ! thou dost too much prevail
I feel thy Force , whilst I against thee rail

Thro ' thy black Jaundice I all Objects see
As Dark , and Terrible as Thee

My Lines decry 'd , and my Employment thought
An useless Folly , or presumptuous Fault

Whilst in their Groves , and by their secret Springs
My Hand delights to trace unusual Things

Nor will in fading Silks compose
Faintly th ' inimitable Rose

Fill up an ill-drawn Bird , or paint on Glass
The Sov'reign 's blurr 'd and undistinguish 'd Face

Patron thou art to ev'ry gross Abuse
The sullen Husband 's feign 'd Excuse

When the ill Humour with his Wife he spends
And bears recruited Wit , and Spirits to his Friends

As to the Glass he still repairs
Pretends but to remove thy Cares

Snatch from thy Shades one gay , and smiling Hour
And drown thy Kingdom in a purple Show ' r

And , changing hastily the Scene
From Light , Impertinent , and Vain

The Cause , indeed , is a Defect in Sense
Yet is the Spleen alleg 'd , and still the dull Pretence

The Tricks of thy pernicious Stage
Which do the weaker Sort engage

By Thee Religion , all we know
That shou 'd enlighten here below

Is veil 'd in Darkness , and perplext
With anxious Doubts , with endless Scruples vext

Whilst Touch not , Taste not , what is freely giv'n
Is but thy niggard Voice , disgracing bounteous Heav'n

From Speech restrain 'd , by thy Deceits abused
To Desarts banish 'd , or in Cells reclused

Mistaken Vot'ries to the Pow'rs Divine
Whilst they a purer Sacrifice design

In vain to chase thee ev'ry Art we try
In vain all Remedies apply

In vain the Indian Leaf infuse
Or the parch 'd Eastern Berry bruise

Now Harmony , in vain , we bring
Inspire the Flute , and touch the String

From Harmony no help is had
Musick but soothes thee , if too sweetly sad

Altho ' his growing Wealth he sees
Daily increas 'd by Ladies Fees

Or thro ' the well-dissected Body trace
The secret , the mysterious ways

Tho ' in the Search , too deep for Humane Thought
With unsuccessful Toil he wrought

Retain 'd thy Pris'ner , thy acknowleg 'd Slave
And sunk beneath thy Chain to a lamented Grave

WITH such a Pulse , with such disorder 'd Veins
Such lab'ring Breath , as thy Disease constrains

With failing Eyes , that scarce the Light endure
( So long unclos 'd , they 've watch 'd thy doubtful Cure

To his HephÃƒÂ¦stion Alexander writes
To soothe thy Days , and wing thy sleepless Nights

I send thee Love : Oh ! that I could impart
As well my vital Spirits to thy Heart

That , when the fierce Distemper thine wou 'd quell
They might renew the Fight , and the cold Foe repel

As on Arbela 's Plains we turn 'd the Day
When Persians through our Troops had mow 'd their way

When the rough Scythians on the Plunder run
And barb'rous Shouts proclaim 'd the Conquest won

'Till o'er my Head ( to stop the swift Despair
The Bird of Jove fans the supporting Air

Above my Plume does his broad Wings display
And follows wheresoe'er I force my way

Whilst Aristander , in his Robe of White
Shews to the wav'ring Host th ' auspicious Sight

New Courage it inspires in ev'ry Breast
And wins at once the Empire of the East

Cou 'd He , but now , some kind Presage afford
That Health might be again to Thee restored

Thou to my Wishes , to my fond Embrace
Thy Looks the same , the same Majestick Grace

That round thee shone , when we together went
To chear the Royal Captives in their Tent

Where Sysigambis , prostrate on the Floor
Did Alexander in thy Form adore

Above great Ãƒâ€ sculapius shou 'd he stand
Or made immortal by Apelles Hand

But no reviving Hope his Art allows
And such cold Damps invade my anxious Brows

As , when in Cydnus plung 'd , I dar 'd the Flood
T ' o'er-match the Boilings of my youthful Blood

But Philip to my Aid repair 'd in haste
And whilst the proffer 'd Draught I boldly taste

As boldly He the dangerous Paper views
Which of hid Treasons does his Fame accuse

More thy Physician 's Life on Thine depends
And what he gives , his Own preserves , or ends

If thou expir'st beneath his fruitless Care
To Rhadamanthus shall the Wretch repair

Near thy Pavilion list'ning Princes wait
Seeking from thine to learn their Monarch 's State

Submitting Kings , that post from Day to Day
To keep those Crowns , which at my Feet they lay

Forget th ' ambitious Subject of their Speed
And here arriv 'd , only Thy Dangers heed

The Beauties of the Clime , now Thou'rt away
Droop , and retire , as if their God of Day

No more upon their early Pray'rs would shine
Or take their Incense , at his late Decline

Thy Parisatis whom I fear to name
Lest to thy Heat it add redoubl 'd Flame

Thy lovely Wife , thy Parisatis weeps
And in her Grief a solemn Silence keeps

Stretch 'd in her Tent , upon the Floor she lies
So pale her Looks , so motionless her Eyes

As when they gave thee leave at first to gaze
Upon the Charms of her unguarded Face

When the beauteous Sisters lowly knelt
And su 'd to those , who more than Pity felt

To chear her now Statira vainly proves
And at thy Name alone she sighs , and moves

But why these single Griefs shou 'd I expose
The World no Mirth , no War , no Bus'ness knows

Ev'n I my boasted Title now resign
Not Ammon 's Son , nor born of Race Divine

But Mortal all , oppress 'd with restless Fears
Wild with my Cares , and Womanish in Tears

Tho ' Tears , before , I for lost Clytus shed
And wept more Drops , than the old Hero bled

Ev'n now , methinks , I see him on the Ground
Now my dire Arms the wretched Corpse surround

Yet He , for whom this mighty Grief did spring
Not Alexander valu 'd , but the King

Then think , how much that Passion must transcend
Which not a Subject raises but a Friend

An equal Partner in the vanquished Earth
A Brother , not impos 'd upon my Birth

Too weak a Tye unequal Thoughts to bind
But by the gen'rous Motions of the Mind

My Love to thee for Empire was the Test
Since him , who from Mankind cou 'd chuse the best

Live then , my Friend ; but if that must not be
Nor Fate will with my boundless Mind agree

To the most Worthy I 'll that Sway resign
And in Elysium keep HyphÃƒÂ¦stion mine

When she meant that he shou 'd Wed
You 're too Young , my Boy , she said

On the Banks of the Severn a desperate Maid
( Whom some Shepherd , neglecting his Vows , had betrayed

Stood resolving to banish all Sense of the Pain
And pursue , thro ' her Death , a Revenge on the Swain

Since the Gods , and my Passion , at once he defies
Since his Vanity lives , whilst my Character dies

No more ( did she say ) will I trifle with Fate
But commit to the Waves both my Love and my Hate

And now to comply with that furious Desire
Just ready to plunge , and alone to expire

Some Reflection on Death , and its Terrors untryed
Some Scorn for the Shepherd , some Flashings of Pride

At length pull 'd her back , and she cry 'd , Why this Strife
Since the Swains are so Many , and I 've but One Life

Why was that baleful Creature made
Which seeks our Quiet to invade

'T was , sure , for every Mortals good
When , by wrong painting of her Brood

Who proffer 'd Safety to her Tribe
Wou 'd she but shew them or describe

When thus she did his Highness tell
In Looks my Young do all excel

You 'd joy to see the pretty Souls
With wadling Steps and frowzy Poles

But I ne'er let them take the Air
The Fortune-hunters do so stare

This ancient Yew three hundred Years
Has been possess 'd by Lineal Heirs

I hope I 've done their Beauties right
Whose Eyes outshine the Stars by Night

The King of Cedars wav 'd his Power
And swore he 'd fast ev'n from that Hour

Th ' Agreement seal 'd , on either part
The Owl now promis 'd , from her Heart

As Centinel to stand and whoop
If single Fowl , or Shoal , or Troop

But home , one Evening without Meat
The Eagle comes , and takes his Seat

The Mother-Owl was prol 'd away
To seek abroad for needful Prey

What 's here ! the hungry Monarch cryed
When near him living Flesh he spyed

But recollecting , 't was the Place
Where he 'd so lately promis 'd Grace

He paus 'd a while , and kept his Maw
With sober Temperance , in awe

What are these Things , and of what Sex
At length he cry 'd , with Vultur 's Becks

These wear no Palatines , nor Muffs
Italian Silks , or Doyley Stuffs

Nor Brightness in their Eyes is seen
But through the Film a dusky Green

Then for my Supper they 're designed
Nor can be of that lovely Kind

No more Delays ; as soon as spoke
The Plumes are stripped , the Grisles broke

When now return 'd the grizly Dame
( Whose Family was out of Frame

How ! quoth the Lord of soaring Fowls
( Whilst horribly she wails and howls

I thought some Phoenix was their Sire
Who did those charming Looks inspire

Upon your self the Blame be laid
My Talons you 've to Blood betrayed

Faces or Books , beyond their Worth extolled
Are censur 'd most , and thus to pieces pulled

A Fond Athenian Mother brought
A Sculptor to indulge her Thought

Who to such strange perfection wrought
That every Eye the Statue caught

A youthful Smile adorn 'd the Face
The polish gave that Smile a Grace

( Which well the Artist 's Skill cou 'd trace
And in their due Positions place

The Parasites about it came
( Whose Praises were too large to name

The Man so well had reach 'd his Aim
Th ' Original cou 'd o'er it claim

Mean while a Sage , amidst the Croud
Thus , with a Precept wise and loud

By telling him , who now grew proud
That tho ' with Beauty 't was endowed

Of no Advantage to the State
'Twou 'd neither combate , nor debate

Bids him beware , whilst Men create
In Stone thus his Resemblance great

Tho ' it too often multiplies his Cares
And who has greater Sense , but greater Sorrow shares

He widely stretches his foreboding Throat
Deaf'ning the easy Crew with his outragious Note

Who with him travel 'd to the neighb'ring Fair
And quickly shou 'd arrive , and be unfetter 'd there

Think 'twill be well , when you have set them down
And eas 'd One of her Milk , the Other of her Gown

Whilst I , whom none but Belzebub wou 'd shear
Nor but his Dam wou 'd milk , must for my Carcase fear

Not He , who thro ' th'unhappy Future prys
Must of the Two be held most Fortunate and Wise

Soothing his Passions with a warb'ling Sound
A Shepherd-Swain lay stretch 'd upon the Ground

Whilst all were mov 'd , who their Attention lent
Or with the Harmony in Chorus went

( Between which two Extreams true Pleasure lies
O'er-run by Fools , unreach'd-at by the Wise

But yet , a fatal Prospect to the Sea
Wou 'd often draw his greedy Sight away

He saw the Barques unlading on the Shore
And guess 'd their Wealth , then scorn 'd his little Store

To Merchandize converted is the Fold
The Bag , the Bottle , and the Hurdles sold

The Dog was chang 'd away , the pretty Skell
Whom he had fed , and taught , and lov 'd so well

In vain the Phillis wept , which heretofore
Receiv 'd his Presents , and his Garlands wore

False and upbraided , he forsakes the Downs
Nor courts her Smiles , nor fears the Ocean 's Frowns

For smooth it lay , as if one single Wave
Made all the Sea , nor Winds that Sea cou 'd heave

Which blew no more than might his Sails supply
Clear was the Air below , and Phoebus laugh 'd on high

With this Advent'rer ev'ry thing combines
And Gold to Gold his happy Voyage joins

But not so prosp'rous was the next Essay
For rugged Blasts encounter 'd on the way

Our broken Merchant in the Wreck was thrown
Upon those Lands , which once had been his own

Where other Flocks now pastur 'd on the Grass
And other Corydons had woo 'd his Lass

A Servant , for small Profits , there he turns
Yet thrives again , and less and less he mourns

Re-purchases in time th'abandon 'd Sheep
Which sad Experience taught him now to keep

When from that very Bank , one Halcyon Day
On which he lean 'd , when tempted to the Sea

He notes a Calm ; the Winds and Waves were still
And promis 'd what the Winds nor Waves fulfill

A settl 'd Quiet , and Conveyance sure
To him that Wealth , by Traffick , wou 'd procure

But the rough part the Shepherd now performs
Reviles the Cheat , and at the Flatt'ry storms

Ev'n thus ( quoth he ) you seem 'd all Rest and Ease
You sleeping Tempests , you untroubl 'd Seas

That ne'er to be forgot , that luckless Hour
In which I put my Fortunes in your Pow ' r

Quitting my slender , but secure Estate
My undisturb 'd Repose , my sweet Retreat

For Treasures which you ravish 'd in a Day
But swept my Folly , with my Goods , away

Then smile no more , nor these false Shews employ
Thou momentary Calm , thou fleeting Joy

No more on me shall these fair Signs prevail
Some other Novice may be won to Sail

Was hast'ning on ; but as he roves
His Foe the slighted Bramble proves

That this injurious partial Wight
Had bid his Gard'ner rid it quite

But from the Abject and the Weak
Who no important Figure make

My Lord ( quoth he ) for all your haste
I 'll know why I must be displaced

Or tap'ring Yews here court the Breeze
That , like some Beaux whom Time does freeze

Who does a rugged Tartar catch
When me he thinks to over-match

For know , where'er my Root is set
These rambling Twigs will Passage get

Then think not to chastise , or rail
Appease the Man , if you 'd prevail

O King of Terrors , whose unbounded Sway
All that have Life , must certainly Obey

The King , the Priest , the Prophet , all are Thine
Nor wou 'd ev'n God ( in Flesh ) thy Stroke decline

My Name is on thy Roll , and sure I must
Encrease thy gloomy Kingdom in the Dust

My soul at this no Apprehension feels
But trembles at thy Swords , thy Racks , thy Wheels

Thy scorching Fevers , which distract the Sense
And snatch us raving , unprepar 'd from hence

At thy contagious Darts , that wound the Heads
Of weeping Friends , who wait at dying Beds

Spare these , and let thy Time be when it will
My Bus'ness is to Dye , and Thine to Kill

Gently thy fatal Sceptre on me lay
And take to thy cold Arms , insensibly , thy Prey

Cou 'd our First Father , at his toilsome Plough
Thorns in his Path , and Labour on his Brow

Cloath 'd only in a rude , unpolish 'd Skin
Cou 'd he a vain Fantastick Nymph have seen

In all her Airs , in all her antick Graces
Her various Fashions , and more various Faces

How had it pos 'd that Skill , which late assigned
Just Appellations to Each several Kind

A right Idea of the Sight to frame
T'have guest from what New Element she came

Since the Road of Life 's so ill
I , to pass it , use this Skill

My frail Carriage driving home
To its latest Stage , the Tomb

Justice first , in Harness strong
Marches stedfastly along

Charity , to smooth the Pace
Fills the next adjoining Trace

Independance leads the Way
Whom no heavy Curb do 's sway

Truth an equal Part sustains
All indulg 'd the loosen 'd Reins

In the Box fits vig'rous Health
Shunning miry Paths of Wealth

Gaiety with easy Smiles
Ev'ry harsher Step beguiles

Whilst of Nature , or of Fate
Only This I wou 'd intreat

The Equipage might not decay
Till the worn Carriage drops away

No Cautions of a Matron , Old and Sage
Young Rattlehead to Prudence cou 'd engage

But forth the Offspring of her Bed wou 'd go
Nor reason gave , but that he wou 'd do so

Much Counsel was , at parting , thrown away
Ev'n all , that Mother-Rat to Son cou 'd say

Who follow 'd him with utmost reach of Sight
Then , lost in Tears , and in abandon 'd Plight

But Fortune , kinder than her boding Thought
In little time the Vagrant homewards brought

Rais 'd in his Mind , and mended in his Dress
Who the Bel-air did every way confess

Had learnt to flow ' r his Wigg , nor brusht away
The falling Meal , that on his Shoulders lay

And from a Nutshell , wimbl 'd by a Worm
Took Snuff , and cou 'd the Government reform

The Mother , weeping from Maternal Love
To see him thus prodigiously improve

Expected mighty Changes too , within
And Wisdom to avoid the Cat , and Gin

Whom did you chiefly note , Sweetheart , quoth she
Of all the Strangers you abroad did see

Who grac 'd you most , or did your Fancy take
The younger Rat than curs 'd a noisy Rake

And fear 'd him so , he trembl 'd ev'ry Part
Nor to describe him , scarce cou 'd have the Heart

High on his Feet ( quoth he ) himself he bore
And terribly , in his own Language , swore

A feather 'd Arm came out from either Side
Which loud he clapp 'd , and Combatants defyed

And certainly his Head with Wounds was sore
For That , and both his Cheeks a Sanguine Colour wore

Near Him there lay the Creature I admired
And for a Friend by Sympathy desired

His Make , like Ours , as far as Tail and Feet
With Coat of Furr in parallel do meet

Yet seeming of a more exalted Race
Tho ' humble Meekness beautify 'd his Face

A purring Sound compos 'd his gentle Mind
Whilst frequent Slumbers did his Eye-lids bind

Whose soft , contracted Paw lay calmly still
As if unus 'd to prejudice , or kill

I paus 'd a while , to meditate a Speech
And now was stepping just within his reach

When that rude Clown began his hect'ring Cry
And made me for my Life , and from th ' Attempt to fly

Indeed 't was Time , the shiv'ring Beldam said
To scour the Plain , and be of Life afraid

Thou base , degen'rate Seed of injur 'd Rats
Thou veriest Fool ( she cry 'd ) of all my Brats

And dost not yet thine Own , and Country 's Foe
At this expence of Time , and Travel know

Alas ! that swearing , staring , bullying Thing
That tore his Throat , and blustered with his Wing

Was but some paltry , Dunghill , Craven Cock
Who serves the early Household for a Clock

And We his Oats , and Barley often steal
Nor fear , he shou 'd revenge the pilfer 'd Meal

Whilst that demure , and seeming harmless Puss
Herself , and mewing Chits regales with Us

If then , of useful Sense thou'st gain 'd no more
Than ere thou'dst past the Threshold of my Door

Be here , my Son , content to Dress and Dine
Steeping the List of Beauties in thy Wine

Amongst Mankind a Thousand Fops we see
Who in their Rambles learn no more than Thee

Cross o'er the Alpes , and make the Tour of France
To learn a paltry Song , or antick Dance

Bringing their Noddles , and Valizes packed
With Mysteries , from Shops and Taylors wrecked

But what may prejudice their Native Land
Whose Troops are raising , or whose Fleet is manned

Thou , my dear Rattlehead , and such as These
Might keep at home , and brood on Sloth and Ease

Whilst Others , more adapted to the Age
May vig'rously in Warlike Feats engage

Thought , by the Beauties of his Face
In Silvia 's Love to find a place

A Youth less Fine , a Youth of Art
Had talk 'd himself into her Heart

His Love alone the Other dressed
As Verse , or Prose became it best

There , in himself now seeks amends
Convinc 'd , that where a Wit pretends

A Greedy Heir long waited to fulfill
As his Executor , a Kinsman 's Will

And to himself his Age repeated o'er
To his Infirmities still adding more

When Death , at last , to either gave Release
Making One 's Pains , the Other 's Longings cease

Who to the Grave must decently convey
Ere he Possession takes the kindred Clay

Which in a Coach was plac 'd , wherein he rides
And so no Hearse , or following Train provides

Rejecting Russel , who wou 'd make the Charge
Of one dull tedious Day , so vastly Large

When , at his Death , the humble Man declared
He wished thus privately to be Interred

And now , the Luggage moves in solemn State
And what it wants in Number , gains in Weight

The happy Heir can scarce contain his Joy
Whilst sundry Musings do his Thoughts employ

How he shalt act , now Every thing 's his Own
Where his Revenge , or Favour shall be shown

The Avenues , and Gardens shall be changed
Already he the Furniture has ranged

To ransack secret Draw'rs his Phancy flies
Nor can th ' appearing Wealth his Mind suffice

Thus he an Age runs o'er betwixt the Porch
Of his Friend 's House , and the adjacent Church

Whilst the slow Driver , who no reck'ning kept
Of what was left , indulging Nature , slept

Till on a Bank , so high , the Wheel was borne
That in a Moment All must overturn

Whilst the rich Heir now finds the giving Dead
Less weighty in his Gold , than in his Lead

Which falling just on his contriving Breast
Expell 'd the Soul , leaving the corpse to rest

In the same Grave , intended for his Friend
Then why shou 'd We our Days in Wishes spend

CUPID , ere depriv 'd of Sight
Young and apt for all Delight

Met with Folly on the way
As Idle and as fond of Play

In gay Sports the time they pass
Now run , now wrestle on the Grass

Their painted Wings then nimbly ply
And ev'ry way for Mast'ry try

'Till a Contest do 's arise
Who has won th ' appointed Prize

Gentle Love refers the Case
To the next , that comes in Place

Trusting to his flatt'ring Wiles
And softens the Dispute with Smiles

But Folly , who no Temper knows
Words pursues with hotter Blows

'Till the eyes of Love were lost
Which has such Pain to Mortals cost

Venus hears his mournful Crys
And repeats 'em , in the Skys

To Jupiter in Council set
With Peers for the Occasion met

In her Arms the Boy she bears
Bathing him in falling Tears

And whilst his want of Eyes is shown
Secures the Judges by her Own

Folly to the Board must come
And hear the Tryal and the Doom

Which Cytherea loudly prays
May be as heavy as the Case

Which , when All was justly weighed
Cupid 's Wings now useless made

That a staff , his Feet must guide
Which wou 'd still be apt to slide

This Decree at last was read
That Love by Folly shou 'd be lead

A Quack , to no true Skill in Physick bred
With frequent Visits cursed his Patient 's Bed

Enquiring , how he did his Broths digest
How chim 'd his Pulse , and how he took his Rest

If shudd'ring Cold by Burnings was pursued
And at what time the Aguish Fit renewed

The waining Wretch , each day become more faint
In like proportion doubles his Complaint

Now swooning Sweats he begs him to allay
Now give his Lungs more liberty to play

Or if he saw the Danger did increase
To warn him fair , and let him part in Peace

My Life for yours , no Hazard in your Case
The Quack replies ; your Voice , your Pulse , your Face

Good Signs afford , and what you seem to feel
Proceeds from Vapours , which we 'll help with Steel

With kindled Rage , more than Distemper , burns
The suff'ring Man , who thus in haste returns

No more of Vapours , your belov 'd Disease
Your Ignorance 's Skreen , your What-you-please

With which you cheat poor Females of their Lives
Whilst Men dispute not , so it rid their Wives

For me , I 'll speak free as I 've paid my Fees
My Flesh consumes , I perish by degrees

And as thro ' weary Nights I count my Pains
No Rest is left me , and no Strength remains

All for the Better , Sir , the Quack rejoins
Exceeding promising are all these Signs

Falling-away , your Nurses can confirm
Was ne'er in Sickness thought a Mark of Harm

The want of Strength is for the Better still
Since Men of Vigour Fevers soonest kill

Ev'n with this Gust of Passion I am pleased
For they 're most Patient who the most are seized

But let me see ! here 's that which all repels
Then shakes , as he some formal Story tells

My Stomach 's gone ( what d'you infer from thence
Nor will with the least Sustenance dispense

The Better ; for , where appetite endures
Meats intermingle , and no Med'cine cures

The Stomach , you must know , Sir , is a PartÃ¢â‚¬ â€œ
But , sure , I feel Death 's Pangs about my Heart

Nay then Farewel ! I need no more attend
The Quack replies . A sad approaching Friend

Questions the Sick , why he retires so fast
Who says , because of Fees I 've paid the Last

And , whilst all Symptoms tow'rd my Cure agree
Am , for the Better , Dying as you see

Observe this Piece , which to our Sight does bring
The fittest Posture for the Swedish King

( Encompass 'd , as we think , with Armies round
Tho ' not express 'd within this narrow Bound

Who , whilst his warlike and extended Hand
Directs the foremost Ranks to Charge or Stand

Reverts his Face , lest That , so Fair and Young
Should call in doubt the Orders of his Tongue

Whilst the excited , and embolden 'd Rear
Such Youth beholding , and such Features there

Thus ! ev'ry Action , ev'ry Grace of thine
O latest Son of Fame , Son of Gustavus Line

Affects thy Troops , with all that can inspire
A blooming Sweetness , and a martial Fire

Fatal to none , but thy invading Foe
So Lightnings , which to all their Brightness shew

'T is fit SERENA shou 'd be sung
High-born SERENA , Fair and Young

Shou 'd be of ev'ry Muse and Voice
The pleasing , and applauded Choice

But as the Meanest of the Show
Do First in all Processions go

So , let my Steps pursue that Swain
The humblest of th ' inspired Train

Whose well-meant Verse did just appear
To lead on the preceding Year

So let my Pen , the next in Fame
Now wait on fair SERENA 's Name

The second Tribute gladly pay
And hail this blest returning Day

But let it not attempt to raise
Or rightly speak SERENA 's Praise

Since with more ease we might declare
How Great her Predecessors were

How Great that more distinguish 'd Peer
To whom she owes her Being here

In whom our Britain lets us see
What once they were , and still shou 'd be

As , when the earliest Race was drowned
Some Patterns , from amongst them found

Were kept to shew succeeding Times
Their Excellence without their Crimes

More easily we might express
What Vertues do her Mother dress

What does her Form and Mind adorn
Of whom th ' engaging Nymph was born

What Piety , what generous Love
Does the enlarged Bosom move

Of Her , whose Fav'rite she appears
Who more than as a Niece endears

Such full Perfections obvious lie
And strike , at first , a Poet 's Eye

Deep Lines of Honour all can hit
Or mark out a superior Wit

Consummate Goodness all can show
And where such Graces shine below

But the more tender Strokes to trace
T ' express the Promise of a Face

When but the Dawnings of the Mind
We from the Air unripen 'd find

Which alt'ring , as new Moments rise
The Pen or Pencil 's Art defies

When Flesh and Blood in Youth appears
Polish 'd like what our Marble wears

Fresh as that Shade of op'ning Green
Which first upon our Groves is seen

Enliven 'd by a harmless Fire
And brighten 'd by each gay Desire

These nicer Touches wou 'd demand
A Cowley 's or a Waller 's Hand

T'explain , with undisputed Art
What 't is affects th'enlighten 'd Heart

When ev'ry darker Thought gives way
Whilst blooming Beauty we survey

To shew how All , that 's soft and sweet
Does in the fair SERENA meet

To tell us , with a sure Presage
The Charms of her maturer Age

When Hothfeild shall ( as heretofore
From its far-sought and virtuous Store

It Families of great Renown
Did with illustrious Hymens crown

When Hothfeild shall such Treasure know
As fair SERENA to bestow

Then shou 'd some Muse of loftier Wing
The Triumphs of that Season sing

Describe the Pains , the Hopes , the Fears
Of noble Youths , th'ambitious Cares

Of Fathers , the long-fram 'd Design
To add such Splendour to their Line

Whilst all shall strive for such a Bride
So Educated , and Allyed

A WIT , transported with Inditing
Unpay 'd , unprais 'd , yet ever Writing

Who , for all Fights and Fav'rite Friends
Had Poems at his Fingers Ends

For new Events was still providing
Yet now desirous to be riding

He pack'd-up ev'ry Ode and Ditty
And in Vacation left the City

So rapt with Figures , and Allusions
With secret Passions , sweet Confusions

With Sentences from Plays well-known
And thousand Couplets of his own

That ev'n the chalky Road look 'd gay
And seem 'd to him the Milky Way

But Fortune , who the Ball is tossing
And Poets ever will be crossing

Misled the Steed , which ill he guided
Where several gloomy Paths divided

The steepest in Descent he followed
Enclos 'd by Rocks , which Time had hollowed

Till , he believ 'd , alive and booted
He 'd reach 'd the Shades by Homer quoted

But all , that he cou 'd there discover
Was , in a Pit with Thorns grown over

Old Mammon digging , straining , sweating
As Bags of Gold he thence was getting

Who , when reprov 'd for such Dejections
By him , who liv 'd on high Reflections

Reply 'd ; Brave Sir , your Time is ended
And Poetry no more befriended

I hid this Coin , when Charles was swaying
When all was Riot , Masking , Playing

When witty Beggars were in fashion
And Learning had o'er-run the Nation

But , since Mankind is so much wiser
That none is valued like the Miser

I draw it hence , and now these Sums
In proper Soil grow up to Plumbs

Which gather 'd once , from that rich Minute
We rule the World , and all that 's in it

But , quoth the Poet , can you raise
As well as Plumb-trees , Groves of Bays

Where you , which I wou 'd chuse much rather
May Fruits of Reputation gather

Will Men of Quality , and Spirit
Regard you for intrinsick Merit

And seek you out , before your Betters
For Conversation , Wit , and Letters

Fool , quoth the Churl , who knew no Breeding
Have these been Times for such Proceeding

Instead of Honour 'd , and Rewarded
Are you not Slighted , or Discarded

What have you met with , but Disgraces
Your PRIOR cou 'd not keep in Places

And your VAN-BRUG had found no Quarter
But for his dabbling in the Morter

ROWE no Advantages cou 'd hit on
Till Verse he left , to write North-Briton

PHILIPS , who 's by the Shilling known
Ne'er saw a Shilling of his own

Meets ( b ) PHILOMELA , in the Town
Her due Proportion of Renown

What Pref'rence has ARDELIA seen
T'expel , tho ' she cou 'd write the Spleen

Of Coach , or Tables , can you brag
Or better Cloaths than Poet RAG

Do wealthy Kindred , when they meet you
With Kindness , or Distinction , greet you

Or have your lately flatter 'd Heroes
Enrich 'd you like the Roman Maroes

NoÃ¢â‚¬ â€œ quoth the Man of broken Slumbers
Yet we have Patrons for our Numbers

There are MecÃƒÂ¦nas 's among 'em
Quoth Mammon , pray Sir , do not wrong 'em

But in your Censures use a Conscience
Nor charge Great Men with thriftless Nonsense

Since they , as your own Poets sing
Now grant no Worth in any thing

Then , never more from your Endeavours
Expect Preferment , or less Favours

But if you 'll 'scape Contempt , or worse
Be sure , put Money in your Purse

Money ! which only can relieve you
When Fame and Friendship will deceive you

Sir , ( quoth the Poet humbly bowing
And all that he had said allowing

Behold me and my airy Fancies
Subdu 'd , like Giants in Romances

I here submit to your Discourses
Which since Experience too enforces

I , in that solitary Pit
Your Gold withdrawn , will hide my Wit

Till Time , which hastily advances
And gives to all new Turns and Chances

Again may bring it into use
Roscommons may again produce

New Augustean Days revive
When Wit shall please , and Poets thrive

Till when , let those converse in private
Who taste what others do n't arrive at

Yielding that Mammonists surpass us
And let the Bank out-swell Parnassus

POOR River , now thou'rt almost dry
What Nymph , or Swain , will near thee lie

Since brought , alas ! to sad Decay
What Flocks , or Herds , will near thee stay

The Swans , that sought thee in thy Pride
Now on new Streams forgetful ride

And Fish , that in thy Bosom lay
Chuse in more prosp'rous Floods to play

All leave thee , now thy Ebb appears
To waste thy sad Remains in Tears

Nor will thy mournful Murmurs heed
Fly , wretched Stream , with all thy speed

Amongst those solid Rocks thy Griefs bestow
For Friends , like those alas ! thou ne'er did'st know

And thou , poor Sun ! that sat'st on high
But late , the Splendour of the Sky

What Flow ' r , tho ' by thy Influence born
Now Clouds prevail , will tow'rds thee turn

Now Darkness sits upon thy Brow
What Persian Votary will bow

What River will her Smiles reflect
Now that no Beams thou can'st direct

By watry Vapours overcast
Who thinks upon thy Glories past

If present Light , nor Heat we get
Unheeded thou may'st rise , and set

Not all the past can one Adorer keep
Fall , wretched Sun , to the more faithful Deep

Nor do thou , lofty Structure ! boast
Since undermin 'd by Time and Frost

Since thou canst no Reception give
In untrod Meadows thou may'st live

None from his ready Road will turn
With thee thy wretched Change to mourn

Not the soft Nights , or chearful Days
Thou hast bestow 'd , can give thee Praise

No lusty Tree that near thee grows
( Tho ' it beneath thy Shelter rose

Will to thy Age a Staff become
Fall , wretched Building ! to thy Tomb

Thou , and thy painted Roofs , in Ruin mixt
Fall to the Earth , for That alone is fixt

The same , poor Man , the same must be
Thy Fate , now Fortune frowns on thee

Her Favour ev'ry one pursues
And losing Her , thou all must lose

No Love , sown in thy prosp'rous Days
Can Fruit in this cold Season raise

No Benefit , by thee conferred
Can in this time of Storms be heard

All from thy troubl 'd Waters run
Thy stooping Fabrick all Men shun

All do thy clouded Looks decline
As if thou ne'er did'st on them shine

O wretched Man ! to other World 's repair
For Faith and Gratitude are only there

PEACE ! where art thou to be found
Where , in all the spacious Round

May thy Footsteps be pursued
Where may thy calm Seats be viewed

On some Mountain dost thou lie
Serenely near the ambient Sky

Smiling at the Clouds below
Where rough Storms and Tempests grow

Or , in some retired Plain
Undisturb 'd dost thou remain

Where no angry Whirlwinds pass
Where no Floods oppress the Grass

High above , or deep below
Fain I thy Retreat wou 'd know

Fain I thee alone wou 'd find
Balm to my o'er-weary 'd Mind

Since what here the World enjoys
Or our Passions most employs

Pleasure 's a tumultuous thing
Busy still , and still on Wing

Flying swift , from place to place
Darting from each beauteous Face

From each strongly mingled Bowl
Through th'inflam 'd and restless Soul

Sov'reign Pow ' r who fondly craves
But himself to Pomp enslaves

Stands the Envy of Mankind
Peace , in vain , attempts to find

Thirst of Wealth no Quiet knows
But near the Death-bed fiercer grows

Wounding Men with secret Stings
For Evils it on Others brings

War who not discreetly shuns
Thorough Life the Gauntlet runs

Swords , and Pikes , and Waves , and Flames
Each their Stroke against him aims

Love ( if such a thing there be
Is all Despair , or Extasie

Poetry 's the feav'rish Fit
Th ' o'erflowing of unbounded Wit

Farewel , lov 'd Youth ! since 't was the Will of Heaven
So soon to take , what had so late been giv'n

And thus our Expectations to destroy
Raising a Grief , where we had form 'd a Joy

Who once believ 'd , it was the Fates Design
In Him to double an Illustrious Line

And in a second Channel spread that Race
Where ev'ry Virtue shines , with every Grace

But we mistook , and 't was not here below
That this engrafted Scion was to grow

The Seats above requir 'd him , that each Sphere
Might soon the Offspring of such Parents share

Resign him then to the supream Intent
You , who but Flesh to that blest Spirit lent

Again disrob 'd , let him to Bliss retire
And only bear from you , amidst that Choir

A Title to Rewards , from that rich store
Of Pious Works , which you have sent before

Then lay the fading Reliques , which remain
In the still Vault ( excluding farther Pain

Where Kings and Counsellors their Progress close
And his renowned Ancestors repose

Where COVENTRY withdrew All but in Name
Leaving the World his Benefits and Fame

Where his Paternal Predecessor lies
Once large of Thought , and rank 'd among the Wise

Whose Genius in Long-Leat we may behold
( A Pile , as noble as if he 'd been told

By WEYMOUTH , it shou 'd be in time possest
And strove to suit the Mansion to the Guest

Nor favour 'd , nor disgrac 'd , there ESSEX sleeps
Nor SOMERSET his Master 's Sorrows weeps

Who to the shelter of th ' unenvy 'd Grave
Convey 'd the Monarch , whom he cou 'd not save

Though , Roman-like , his own less-valu 'd Head
He proffer 'd in that injur 'd Martyr 's stead

Nor let that matchless Female 'scape my Pen
Who their Whole Duty taught to weaker Men

And of each Sex the Two best Gifts enjoyed
The Skill to write , the Modesty to hide

Whilst none shou 'd that Performance disbelieve
Who led the Life , might the Directions give

With such as These , whence He deriv 'd his Blood
Great on Record , or eminently Good

Let Him be laid , till Death 's long Night shall cease
And breaking Glory interrupt the Peace

Mean-while , ye living Parents , ease your Grief
By Tears , allow 'd as Nature 's due Relief

For when we offer to the Pow'rs above
Like You , the dearest Objects of our Love

When , with that patient Saint in Holy Writ
We 've learnt at once to Grieve , and to Submit

When contrite Sighs , like hallow 'd Incense , rise
Bearing our Anguish to th ' appeased Skies

Then may those Show'rs , which take from Sorrow birth
And still are tending tow'rd this baleful Earth

O'er all our deep and parching Cares diffuse
Like Eden 's Springs , or Hermon 's soft'ning Dews

But lend your Succours , ye Almighty Pow'rs
For as the Wound , the Balsam too is Yours

In vain are Numbers , or persuasive Speech
What Poets write , or what the Pastors teach

For when to Shades of Death our Joys are fled
When for a Loss , like This , our Tears are shed

But yet , my Muse , if thou hadst softer Verse
Than e'er bewail 'd the melancholy Herse

If thou hadst Pow ' r to dissipate the Gloom
Inherent to the Solitary Tomb

To rescue thence the Memory and Air
Of what we lately saw so Fresh , so Fair

Then shou 'd this Noble Youth thy Art engage
To shew the Beauties of his blooming Age

The pleasing Light , that from his Eyes was cast
Like hasty Beams , too Vigorous to last

Where the warm Soul , as on the Confines , lay
Ready for Flight , and for Eternal Day

Gently dispos 'd his Nature shou 'd be shown
And all the Mother 's Sweetness made his Own

The Father 's Likeness was but faintly seen
As ripen 'd Fruits are figur 'd by the Green

Nor cou 'd we hope , had he fulfill 'd his Days
He shou 'd have reach 'd WEYMOUTH 's unequal 'd Praise

Still One distinguish 'd plant each Lineage shews
And all the rest beneath it 's Stature grows

Of Tully 's Race but He possess 'd the Tongue
And none like Julius from the Caesars sprung

Next , in his harmless Sports he shou 'd be drawn
Urging his Courser , o'er the flow'ry Lawn

Sprightly Himself , as the enliven 'd Game
Bold in the Chace , and full of gen'rous Flame

Yet in the Palace , Tractable and Mild
Perfect in all the Duties of a Child

Which fond Reflection pleases , whilst it pains
Like penetrating Notes of sad Harmonious Strains

Selected Friendships timely he began
And siezed in Youth that best Delight of Man

Leaving a growing Race to mourn his End
Their earliest and their Ages promis 'd Friend

But far away alas ! that Prospect moves
Lost in the Clouds , like distant Hills and Groves

Whilst with encreasing Steps we all pursue
What Time alone can bring to nearer View

That Future State , which Darkness yet involves
Known but by Death , which ev'ry Doubt resolves

Weary , at last , of the Pindarick way
Thro ' which advent'rously the Muse wou 'd stray

To Fable I descend with soft Delight
Pleas 'd to Translate , or easily Endite

Whilst aery Fictions hastily repair
To fill my Page , and rid my Thoughts of Care

As they to Birds and Beasts new Gifts impart
And Teach , as Poets shou 'd , whilst they Divert

But here , the Critick bids me check this Vein
Fable , he crys , tho ' grown th ' affected Strain

Whilst of his Aim the lazy Trifler fails
Who seeks to purchase Fame by childish Tales

Then , let my Verse , once more attempt the Skies
The easily persuaded Poet cries

The Walls of Troy shall be our loftier Stage
Our mighty Theme the fierce Achilles Rage

The Strength of Hector , and Ulysses Arts
Shall boast such Language , to adorn their Parts

As neither Hobbes , nor Chapman cou 'd bestow
Or did from Congreve , or from Dryden flow

Amidst her Towers , the dedicated Horse
Shall be receiv 'd , big with destructive Force

Till Men shall say , when Flames have brought her down
`` Troy is no more , and Ilium was a Town

Is this the way to please the Men of Taste
The Interrupter cries , this old Bombast

I 'm sick of Troy , and in as great a Fright
When some dull Pedant wou 'd her Wars recite

To Shades and Springs shall we awhile repair
The Muse demands , and in that milder Air

Describe some gentle Swain 's unhappy Smart
Whose folded Arms still press upon his Heart

Whilst Phillis with a careless pleasure reigns
The Joy , the Grief , the Envy of the Plains

Heightens the Beauty of the verdant Woods
And softens all the Murmurs of the Floods

Oh ! stun me not with these insipid Dreams
Th ' Eternal Hush , the Lullaby of Streams

Which still , he cries , their even Measures keep
Till both the Writers , and the Readers sleep

But urge thy Pen , if thou wouldst move our Thoughts
To shew us private , or the publick Faults

Display the Times , High-Church or Low provoke
We 'll praise the Weapon , as we like the Stroke

And warmly sympathizing with the Spite
Apply to Thousands , what of One you write

Then , must that single Stream the Town supply
The harmless Fable-writer do 's reply

And when so many choice Productions swarm
Must only Satire keep your Fancies warm

Whilst even there , you praise with such Reserve
As if you 'd in the midst of Plenty starve

Happy the Men , whom we divert with Ease
Whom Opera 's and Panegyricks please

Through ev'ry Age some Tyrant Passion reigns
Now Love prevails , and now Ambition gains

Tho ' beyond Love 's , Ambition 's Empire goes
For who feels Love , Ambition also knows

And proudly still aspires to be possest
Of Her , he thinks superior to the rest

As cou 'd be prov 'd , but that our plainer Task
Do 's no such Toil , or Definitions ask

But to be so rehears 'd , as first 't was told
When such old Stories pleas 'd in Days of old

A King , observing how a Shepherd 's Skill
Improv 'd his Flocks , and did the Pastures fill

That equal Care th ' assaulted did defend
And the secur 'd and grazing Part attend

Approves the Conduct , and from Sheep and Curs
Transfers the Sway , and changed his Wool to Furrs

Lord-Keeper now , as rightly he divides
His just Decrees , and speedily decides

When his sole Neighbor , whilst he watch 'd the Fold
A Hermit poor , in Contemplation old

Hastes to his Ear , with safe , but lost Advice
Tells him such Heights are levell 'd in a trice

And that already sure 't had turn 'd his Brain
Who thought a Prince 's Favour to retain

Nor seem 'd unlike , in this mistaken Rank
The sightless Wretch , who froze upon a Bank

A Serpent found , which for a Staff he took
And us 'd as such ( his own but lately broke

Thanking the Fates , who thus his Loss supplyed
Nor marking one , that with amazement cryed

Throw quickly from thy Hand that sleeping Ill
A Serpent 't is , that when awak 'd will kill

A Serpent this ! th ' uncaution 'd Fool replies
A Staff it feels , nor shall my want of Eyes

Make me believe , I have no Senses left
And thro ' thy Malice be of this bereft

Which Fortune to my Hand has kindly sent
To guide my Steps , and stumbling to prevent

No Staff , the Man proceeds ; but to thy harm
A Snake 'twill prove : The Viper , now grown warm

Thus wilt thou find , Shepherd believe it true
Some Ill , that shall this seeming Good ensue

Thousand Distastes , t ' allay thy envy 'd Gains
Unthought of , on the parcimonious Plains

So prov 'd the Event , and Whisp'rers now defame
The candid Judge , and his Proceedings blame

By Wrongs , they say , a Palace he erects
The Good oppresses , and the Bad protects

To view this Seat the King himself prepares
Where no Magnificence or Pomp appears

But Moderation , free from each Extream
Whilst Moderation is the Builder 's Theme

Asham 'd yet still the Sycophants persist
That Wealth he had conceal 'd within a Chest

Which but attended some convenient Day
To face the Sun , and brighter Beams display

The Chest unbarr 'd , no radiant Gems they find
No secret Sums to foreign Banks designed

But humble Marks of an obscure Recess
Emblems of Care , and Instruments of Peace

The Hook , the Scrip , and for unblam 'd Delight
The merry Bagpipe , which , ere fall of Night

Cou 'd sympathizing Birds to tuneful Notes invite
Welcome ye Monuments of former Joys

Welcome ! to bless again your Master 's Eyes
And draw from Courts , th ' instructed Shepherd cries

No more dear Relicks ! we no more will part
You shall my Hands employ , who now revive my Heart

No Emulations , nor corrupted Times
Shall falsely blacken , or seduce to Crimes

Him , whom your honest Industry can please
Who on the barren Down can sing from inward Ease

How 's this ! the Monarch something mov 'd rejoins
With such low Thoughts , and Freedom from Designs

What made thee leave a Life so fondly prized
To be in Crouds , or envy 'd , or despised

Forgive me , Sir , and Humane Frailty see
The Swain replies , in my past State and Me

All peaceful that , to which I vow return
But who alas ! ( tho ' mine at length I mourn

Author of Murmurs , and of Care
Of pleasing Hopes , concluding in Despair

To thee my strange Felicity I owe
From thy Oppression did this Succour flow

Less had I gained , had'st thou propitious been
Who better by my Loss hast taught me how to Win

Those useful Pieces , which she gave
Can I again , or wou 'd I have

Yet let us quit th ' obliging Score
And whilst we borrow 'd Gold restore

Whilst readily we own the Debt
And Gratitude before her set

That also in her turn she ought
( Repaying ev'ry tender Thought

Fair Youth ! who wish the Wars may cease
We own you better form 'd for Peace

Nor Pallas you , nor Mars shou 'd follow
Your Gods are Cupid and Apollo

Who give sweet Looks , and early Rhimes
Bespeaking Joys , and Halcyon Times

Your Face , which We , as yet , may praise
Calls for the Myrtle , and the Bays

The Martial Crowns Fatigues demand
And laurell 'd Heroes must be tanned

A Fate , we never can allow
Shou 'd reach your pleasing , polish 'd Brow

But granting what so young you 've writ
From Nature flow 'd , as well as Wit

And that indeed you Peace pursue
We must begin to Treat with you

We Females , Sir , it is I mean
Whilst I , like BRISTOL for the QUEEN

For all the Ladies of your Age
As Plenipo ' betimes engage

And as first Article declare
You shall be Faithful as you 're Fair

No Sighs , when you shall know their Use
Shall be discharg 'd in Love 's Abuse

Nor kindling Words shall undermine
Till you in equal Passion join

Nor Money be alone your Aim
Tho ' you an Over-weight may claim

And fairly build on your Desert
If with your Person goes your Heart

But when this Barrier I have gained
And trust it will be well maintained

Who knows , but some imprudent She
Betraying what 's secur 'd by me

Shall yield thro ' Verse , or stronger Charms
To Treat anew on easier Terms

And I be negligently toldÃ¢
You was too Young , and I too Old

Sooner I 'd praise a Cloud which Light beguiles
Than thy rash Hand which robs this Face of Smiles

And does that sweet and pleasing Air controul
Which to us paints the fair CLEONE 's Soul

'T is vain to boast of Rules or labour 'd Art
I miss the Look that captivates my Heart

Attracts my Love , and tender Thoughts inspires
Nor can my Breast be warm 'd by common Fires

Like Jupiter 's , thy Head was sure in Pain
When this Virago struggl 'd in thy Brain

And strange it is , thou hast not made her wield
A mortal Dart , or penetrating Shield

Giving that Hand of disproportion 'd size
The Pow ' r , of which thou hast disarm 'd her Eyes

As if , like Amazons , she must oppose
And into Lovers force her vanquish 'd Foes

Had to THEANOR thus her Form been shown
To gain her Heart , he had not lost his own

Nor , by the gentlest Bands of Human Life
At once secur 'd the Mistress and the Wife

For still CLEONE 's Beauties are the same
And what first lighten 'd , still upholds his Flame

Fain his Compassion wou 'd thy Works approve
Were pitying thee consistent with his Love

Or with the Taste which Italy has wrought
In his refin 'd and daily heighten 'd Thought

Where Poetry , or Painting find no place
Unless perform 'd with a superior Grace

Cou 'd but my Wish some Influence infuse
Ne'er shou 'd the Pencil , or the Sister-Muse

But strictest Censors shou 'd of either judge
Applaud the Artist , and despise the Drudge

Then never wou 'd thy Colours have debased
CLEONE 's Features , and her Charms defaced

Nor had my Pen ( more subject to their Laws
Assay 'd to vindicate her Beauty 's Cause

A rigid Fear had kept us both in Awe
Nor I compos 'd , nor thou presum 'd to draw

But in CLEONE viewing with Surprize
That Excellence , to which we ne'er cou 'd rise

By less Attempts we safely might have gained
That humble Praise which neither has obtained

Since to thy Shadowings , or my ruder Verse
It is not giv'n to shew , or to rehearse

What Nature in CLEONE 's Face has writ
A soft Endearment , and a chearful Wit

That all-subduing , that enliv'ning Air
By which , a sympathizing Joy we share

And since my skill no worship can impart
Make you an incense of my loving heart

That poison sweet hath done me all this wrong
For now of love must needs be all my song

`` Pardon , '' he said , `` For why ? You seemed to me
My mother Venus in her pride to be

Heavens were deceived , and wrong they do esteem
She hath no heat , although she living seem

A kiss of hers , as I , poor soul , do prove
Can make the hottest freeze and coldest love

So now , sweet love , though I myself be thrall
Not her a goddess , but thyself I call

Then take my heart , and place it with your own
So shall you naked never more be known

Thus two at once by love were both undone
My heart not loved , and armless Venus ' son

Then shall I say as by trial find
These all are hard , but you , my love , are kind

No , Venus , no : she scorns them , credit me
But robbed thy son that none might care for thee

For she alone all hope all comfort gives
Men 's hearts , souls , all , led by her favour lives

She them surpasseth , when their prides are full
As far as they surpass the meanest trull

Kiss me , sweet love , this favor do for me
Then crowns and kingdoms shall I scorn for thee

Thus in the pride and beauty of her eyes
The seely boy the greatest god defies

His feathers still she used for a fan
Till by exchange my heart his feathers won

Then burn me , sweet , with brightness of your eyes
That phoenix-like from thence I may arise

Thus whilst I live for kisses I must call
Still kiss me , sweet , or kiss me not at all

Accept them , sweet , as incense due to thee
For you immortal made them so to be

So shall all these though troubles ease my grief
If that they serve to work in thee belief

A flame I took whenas I stole the kiss
Take you my life , yet can I live with this

Live but , fair love , and banish thy disease
And love , kind heart , both where and whom thou please

Speak you , sweet love , for you did all the wrong
That broke his arrows , and did bind his tongue

I call thee Venus , sweet , but be not wroth
Thou art more chaste , yet seas did favor both

Unmask you , sweet , and spare not ; dim the sun
Your light 's enough , although that his were done

Then will I hope , a goddess and so near
She can not choose my sighs and prayers but hear

Gaze at her brows , where heaven ingrafted is
Then sigh , and swear , there is no heaven but this

Live then , fair Licia , in this place alone
Then shall I joy though all of these were gone

Then if by you these streams thus blessed be
Sweet , grant me love , and be not worse to me

Thus all , sweet fair , in time must have an end
Except thy beauty , virtues , and thy friend

Heavens , let me sleep , and shows my senses feed
Or let me wake and happy be indeed

Then since thy force , heavens , earth , nor seas can move
I conquered yield , and do confess I love

Yet all these graces , blots , not graces are
If you , my love , of love do take no care

Then heavens , make Licia fair most kind to me
Or with my life my loss may finished be

Believe me , fair , and let my paper live
Or be not fair , and so me freedom give

Send but a sigh my flame for to increase
Or lend a tear and cause it so to cease

If all were mine , this envy would be gone
Then grant me all , fair sweet , or grant me none

Thus sighs and tears , flame , grief shall plead for me
So shall I pray , and you a goddess be

Then you , fair Lucia , sovereign of my heart
Read to yourself my anguish and my smart

But thoughts too rash my heart doth now repent
And as you please , they swear , they are content

Then shall I praise that heaven for such a sun
That saved my life , whenas my grief begun

Then greater graces , Licia , do impart
Not dumb replies unto a speaking heart

My thoughts presage , which time to come shall try
That thousands conquered for their love shall die

Thy fact thus , Charon , both of us shall bless
Thou save thy boat and I my love possess

Together placed so thou her scorn shalt cross
Where if we part thy boat must suffer loss

Heavens , grant that light and so me waking keep
Or shut my eyes and rock me fast asleep

Then let your love so with my fault dispense
That all my parts feel not mine eyes ' offense

Now never after soul shall live in dark
That hath the hap this western sun to mark

Like Niobe queen which made a stone did weep
Licia my heart dead and alive doth keep

Then muse not , Licia , if my Muse be slack
For when I wrote I did thy beauty lack

No , no , thou didst by chance my Licia see
Who for her look Minerva seemed to thee

Then grace me , sweet , and with thy favor raise me
So shall I live and all the world shall praise thee

But if you frown I wish that none believe me
For slain with sighs I 'll die before I grieve thee

Yet all these honors deemed are but pelf
For she is much more worthy of herself

Now if you ask where dwelleth all this bliss
Seek out my love and she will tell you this

Love , I repent me that I thought
My sighs and languish dearly bought

For sighs and languish both did prove
That he that languished sighed for love

Cruel rigor , foe to state
Looks disdainful , fraught with hate

I did blame , but had no cause
Love hath eyes , but hath no laws

She was sad and could not choose
To see me sigh and sit and muse

We both did love and both did doubt
Least any should our love find out

Our hearts did speak , by sighs most hidden
This means was left , all else forbidden

I did frown her love to try
She did sigh and straight did cry

Both of us did sighs believe
Yet either grieved friend to grieve

I did look and then did smile
She left sighing all that while

Both were glad to see that change
Things in love that are not strange

Suspicion , foolish foe to reason
Caused me seek to find some treason

I did court another dame
False in love , it is a shame

She was sorry this to view
Thinking faith was proved untrue

Then she swore she would not love
One whom false she once did prove

I did vow I never meant
From promise made for to relent

The more I said the worse she thought
My oaths and vows were deemed as naught

`` False , '' she said `` how can it be
To court another yet love me

Crowns and love no partners brook
If she be liked I am forsook

Farewell , false , and love her still
Your chance was good , but mine was ill

No harm to you , but this I crave
That your new love may you deceive

And jest with you as you have done
For light 's the love that quickly won

`` Kind , and fair-sweet , once believe me
Jest I did but not to grieve thee

Court I did , but did not love
All my speech was you to prove

Words and sighs and what I spent
In show to her , to you were meant

Fond I was your love to cross
Jesting love oft brings this loss

Forget this fault , and love your friend
Which vows his truth unto the end

`` Content , '' she said , `` if this you keep
Thus both did kiss , and both did weep

For women long they can not chide
As I by proof in this have tried

Doris the fair with Galate did chide
She liked her choice , and to her taunts replied

Neptune that doth the glassy ocean tame
Neptune , by birth from mighty Jove which came

Nay , smile not , nymphs , the truth I only tell
For few can brook that others should excel

Your look was pale , and so his stomach fed
But far from fair , where white doth want his red

My love doth tune his love unto his harp
His shape is rude , but yet his wit is sharp

I can not choose , sweet nymph , to think , but smile
That some of us thou fear'st will thee beguile

Scorn not my love , until it can be known
That you have one that 's better of your own

Now thus we learn what foolish love can do
To think him fair that 's foul and ugly too

To hear this talk , I sat behind an oak
And marked their words and penned them as they spoke

Thus eyes and thoughts , that fairest fair , my love
Blind and untrue , unkind , unconstant prove

Thus eyes and thoughts , my dearest fair may view
In sight , in love , not blind , nor yet untrue

Thus new my love , and still that fair unkind
Renews my love , and I no favour find

Thus dreams , and night , my heart , my pangs , and all
In taste , in length , conspire to work my fall

Thus dreams and nights wherein my love take sport
Are sweet , unsweet , are long , and yet too short

Thus you my love unkindly cause this smart
That will not love to ease my pangs and heart

Thus looks and days and sighs and death might move
So kind , so fair , to give consent to love

Thus looks and days increase this loving strife
Not proud , nor done , nor dead , nor giving life

Thus sighs and death my heart no comfort give
Both life deny , and both do make me live

Thus smiles and words , her lips , her hands , and she
Bold , wise , cold , ice , love 's cruel torments be

Thus smiles and words , so cruel and so bold
So blushing wise , my thoughts in prison hold

Thus lips and hands cold ice my sorrow brew
Hands , warm white snow and lips cold cherry-red

Thus hair and shape , those folding arms and waist
Did make me love , and loving made me waste

Thus smallest waist , the greatest waste doth make
And finest hair most fast a lover take

Thus shape and arms with love my heart did ply
That hers I am , and must be till I die

Thus was my heart with joy , speech , toys and stay
Possessed with love , and so stol'n quite away

Thus joy and stay , both crossed a lover 's sport
The one was sad , the other too too short

Thus speech and toys my love began in jest
Sweet , yield to love , and make thy servant blest

If not , sweet love , then this my suit deny
So shall you live , and so your servant die

I could not choose but kiss , but wake , but smile
To see how she thought us two to beguile

`` Then kiss me , sweet , that so I sleep may take
Or let me kiss to keep you still awake

Love wept for grief , and sighing made great moan
And could not sleep nor stay if she were gone

`` Ah Licia , '' still I in my dreams did cry
`` Come , Licia , come , or else my heart will die

Thus did we part in hope to meet again
Where both did vow most constant to remain

Haply he seeks his sorrows to renew
That for his love doth make another sue

Happy those lips that had so sweet a kiss
For heaven itself scarce yields so sweet a bliss

Then blame me not , that kissing sighed and swore
I kissed but her whom you had kissed before

And thus , kind love , the sum of all my bliss
Was but begun and ended in a kiss

And love me , dear , and still still kissing be
Both like and love , but none , sweet love , but me

Let me conspire and time will have an end
So both of us in time shall have a friend

REMOTE , unfriended , melancholy , slow
Or by the lazy Scheldt , or wandering Po

Or onward , where the rude Carinthian boor
Against the houseless stranger shuts the door

Or where Campania 's plain forsaken lies
A weary waste expanding to the skies

Where'er I roam , whatever realms to see
My heart untravell 'd fondly turns to thee

Still to my brother turns with ceaseless pain
And drags at each remove a lengthening chain

Eternal blessings crown my earliest friend
And round his dwelling guardian saints attend

Bless 'd be that spot , where cheerful guests retire
To pause from toil , and trim their ev'ning fire

Bless 'd that abode , where want and pain repair
And every stranger finds a ready chair

Bless 'd be those feasts with simple plenty crowned
Where all the ruddy family around

Laugh at the jests or pranks that never fail
Or sigh with pity at some mournful tale

Or press the bashful stranger to his food
And learn the luxury of doing good

But me , not destin 'd such delights to share
My prime of life in wand'ring spent and care

Impell 'd , with steps unceasing , to pursue
Some fleeting good , that mocks me with the view

That , like the circle bounding earth and skies
Allures from far , yet , as I follow , flies

My fortune leads to traverse realms alone
And find no spot of all the world my own

E'en now , where Alpine solitudes ascend
I sit me down a pensive hour to spend

And , plac 'd on high above the storm 's career
Look downward where a hundred realms appear

Lakes , forests , cities , plains , extending wide
The pomp of kings , the shepherd 's humbler pride

When thus Creation 's charms around combine
Amidst the store , should thankless pride repine

Say , should the philosophic mind disdain
That good , which makes each humbler bosom vain

Let school-taught pride dissemble all it can
These little things are great to little man

And wiser he , whose sympathetic mind
Exults in all the good of all mankind

Ye glitt'ring towns , with wealth and splendour crowned
Ye fields , where summer spreads profusion round

Ye lakes , whose vessels catch the busy gale
Ye bending swains , that dress the flow'ry vale

For me your tributary stores combine
Creation 's heir , the world , the world is mine

As some lone miser visiting his store
Bends at his treasure , counts , re-counts it o'er

Hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill
Yet still he sighs , for hoards are wanting still

Thus to my breast alternate passions rise
Pleas 'd with each good that heaven to man supplies

Yet oft a sigh prevails , and sorrows fall
To see the hoard of human bliss so small

And oft I wish , amidst the scene , to find
Some spot to real happiness consigned

Where my worn soul , each wand'ring hope at rest
May gather bliss to see my fellows blessed

But where to find that happiest spot below
Who can direct , when all pretend to know

The shudd'ring tenant of the frigid zone
Boldly proclaims that happiest spot his own

Extols the treasures of his stormy seas
And his long nights of revelry and ease

The naked negro , panting at the line
Boasts of his golden sands and palmy wine

Basks in the glare , or stems the tepid wave
And thanks his gods for all the good they gave

Such is the patriot 's boast , where'er we roam
His first , best country ever is , at home

And yet , perhaps , if countries we compare
And estimate the blessings which they share

Though patriots flatter , still shall wisdom find
An equal portion dealt to all mankind

As different good , by Art or Nature given
To different nations makes their blessings even

Nature , a mother kind alike to all
Still grants her bliss at Labour 's earnest call

With food as well the peasant is supplied
On Idra 's cliffs as Arno 's shelvy side

And though the rocky-crested summits frown
These rocks , by custom , turn to beds of down

From Art more various are the blessings sent
Wealth commerce , honour , liberty , content

Yet these each other 's power so strong contest
That either seems destructive of the rest

Where wealth and freedom reign , contentment fails
And honour sinks where commerce long prevails

Hence every state to one lov 'd blessing prone
Conforms and models life to that alone

Each to the favourite happiness attends
And spurns the plan that aims at other ends

Till , carried to excess in each domain
This favourite good begets peculiar pain

But let us try these truths with closer eyes
And trace them through the prospect as it lies

Here for a while my proper cares resigned
Here let me sit in sorrow for mankind

Like yon neglected shrub at random cast
That shades the steep , and sighs at every blast

Far to the right where Apennine ascends
Bright as the summer , Italy extends

Its uplands sloping deck the mountain 's side
Woods over woods in gay theatric pride

While oft some temple 's mould'ring tops between
With venerable grandeur mark the scene

Could Nature 's bounty satisfy the breast
The sons of Italy were surely blest

Whatever fruits in different climes were found
That proudly rise , or humbly court the ground

Whatever blooms in torrid tracts appear
Whose bright succession decks the varied year

Whatever sweets salute the northern sky
With vernal lives that blossom but to die

These here disporting own the kindred soil
Nor ask luxuriance from the planter 's toil

While sea-born gales their gelid wings expand
To winnow fragrance round the smiling land

But small the bliss that sense alone bestows
And sensual bliss is all the nation knows

In florid beauty groves and fields appear
Man seems the only growth that dwindles here

Contrasted faults through all his manner reign
Though poor , luxurious ; though submissive , vain

Though grave , yet trifling ; zealous , yet untrue
And e'en in penance planning sins anew

All evils here contaminate the mind
That opulence departed leaves behind

For wealth was theirs , not far remov 'd the date
When commerce proudly flourish 'd through the state

At her command the palace learn 'd to rise
Again the long-fall'n column sought the skies

The canvas glow 'd beyond e'en Nature warm
The pregnant quarry teem 'd with human form

Till , more unsteady than the southern gale
Commerce on other shores display 'd her sail

While nought remain 'd of all that riches gave
But towns unmann 'd , and lords without a slave

And late the nation found , with fruitless skill
Its former strength was but plethoric ill

Yet still the loss of wealth is here supplied
By arts , the splendid wrecks of former pride

From these the feeble heart and long-fall'n mind
An easy compensation seem to find

Here may be seen , in bloodless pomp arrayed
The paste-board triumph and the cavalcade

Processions form 'd for piety and love
A mistress or a saint in every grove

By sports like these are all their cares beguiled
The sports of children satisfy the child

Each nobler aim , repress 'd by long control
Now sinks at last , or feebly mans the soul

While low delights , succeeding fast behind
In happier meanness occupy the mind

As in those domes , where Caesars once bore sway
Defac 'd by time and tottering in decay

There in the ruin , heedless of the dead
The shelter-seeking peasant builds his shed

And , wond'ring man could want the larger pile
Exults , and owns his cottage with a smile

My soul , turn from them ; turn we to survey
Where rougher climes a nobler race display

Where the bleak Swiss their stormy mansions tread
And force a churlish soil for scanty bread

No product here the barren hills afford
But man and steel , the soldier and his sword

No vernal blooms their torpid rocks array
But winter ling'ring chills the lap of May

No Zephyr fondly sues the mountain 's breast
But meteors glare , and stormy glooms invest

Yet still , e'en here , content can spread a charm
Redress the clime , and all its rage disarm

Though poor the peasant 's hut , his feasts though small
He sees his little lot the lot of all

Sees no contiguous palace rear its head
To shame the meanness of his humble shed

No costly lord the sumptuous banquet deal
To make him loathe his vegetable meal

But calm , and bred in ignorance and toil
Each wish contracting , fits him to the soil

Cheerful at morn he wakes from short repose
Breasts the keen air , and carols as he goes

With patient angle trolls the finny deep
Or drives his vent'rous plough-share to the steep

Or seeks the den where snow-tracks mark the way
And drags the struggling savage into day

At night returning , every labour sped
He sits him down the monarch of a shed

Smiles by his cheerful fire , and round surveys
His children 's looks , that brighten at the blaze

While his lov 'd partner , boastful of her hoard
Displays her cleanly platter on the board

And haply too some pilgrim , thither led
With many a tale repays the nightly bed

Thus every good his native wilds impart
Imprints the patriot passion on his heart

And e'en those ills , that round his mansion rise
Enhance the bliss his scanty fund supplies

Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms
And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms

And as a child , when scaring sounds molest
Clings close and closer to the mother 's breast

So the loud torrent , and the whirlwind 's roar
But bind him to his native mountains more

Such are the charms to barren states assigned
Their wants but few , their wishes all confined

Yet let them only share the praises due
If few their wants , their pleasures are but few

For every want that stimulates the breast
Becomes a source of pleasure when redrest

Whence from such lands each pleasing science flies
That first excites desire , and then supplies

Unknown to them , when sensual pleasures cloy
To fill the languid pause with finer joy

Unknown those powers that raise the soul to flame
Catch every nerve , and vibrate through the frame

Their level life is but a smould'ring fire
Unquench 'd by want , unfann 'd by strong desire

Unfit for raptures , or , if raptures cheer
On some high festival of once a year

In wild excess the vulgar breast takes fire
Till , buried in debauch , the bliss expire

But not their joys alone thus coarsely flow
Their morals , like their pleasures , are but low

For , as refinement stops , from sire to son
Unalter 'd , unimprov 'd the manners run

And love 's and friendship 's finely pointed dart
Fall blunted from each indurated heart

Some sterner virtues o'er the mountain 's breast
May sit , like falcons cow'ring on the nest

But all the gentler morals , such as play
Through life 's more cultur 'd walks , and charm the way

These far dispers 'd , on timorous pinions fly
To sport and flutter in a kinder sky

To kinder skies , where gentler manners reign
I turn ; and France displays her bright domain

Gay sprightly land of mirth and social ease
Pleas 'd with thyself , whom all the world can please

How often have I led thy sportive choir
With tuneless pipe , beside the murmuring Loire

Where shading elms along the margin grew
And freshen 'd from the wave the Zephyr flew

And haply , though my harsh touch falt'ring still
But mock 'd all tune , and marr 'd the dancer 's skill

Yet would the village praise my wondrous power
And dance , forgetful of the noon-tide hour

Alike all ages . Dames of ancient days
Have led their children through the mirthful maze

And the gay grandsire , skill 'd in gestic lore
Has frisk 'd beneath the burthen of threescore

So bless 'd a life these thoughtless realms display
Thus idly busy rolls their world away

Theirs are those arts that mind to mind endear
For honour forms the social temper here

Honour , that praise which real merit gains
Or e'en imaginary worth obtains

Here passes current ; paid from hand to hand
It shifts in splendid traffic round the land

From courts , to camps , to cottages it strays
And all are taught an avarice of praise

They please , are pleas 'd , they give to get esteem
Till , seeming bless 'd , they grow to what they seem

But while this softer art their bliss supplies
It gives their follies also room to rise

For praise too dearly lov 'd , or warmly sought
Enfeebles all internal strength of thought

And the weak soul , within itself unblest
Leans for all pleasure on another 's breast

Hence ostentation here , with tawdry art
Pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart

Here vanity assumes her pert grimace
And trims her robes of frieze with copper lace

Here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer
To boast one splendid banquet once a year

The mind still turns where shifting fashion draws
Nor weighs the solid worth of self-applause

To men of other minds my fancy flies
Embosom 'd in the deep where Holland lies

Methinks her patient sons before me stand
Where the broad ocean leans against the land

And , sedulous to stop the coming tide
Lift the tall rampire 's artificial pride

Onward , methinks , and diligently slow
The firm-connected bulwark seems to grow

Spreads its long arms amidst the wat'ry roar
Scoops out an empire , and usurps the shore

While the pent ocean rising o'er the pile
Sees an amphibious world beneath him smile

The slow canal , the yellow-blossom 'd vale
The willow-tufted bank , the gliding sail

The crowded mart , the cultivated plain
A new creation rescu 'd from his reign

Thus , while around the wave-subjected soil
Impels the native to repeated toil

Industrious habits in each bosom reign
And industry begets a love of gain

Hence all the good from opulence that springs
With all those ills superfluous treasure brings

Are here displayed . Their much-lov 'd wealth imparts
Convenience , plenty , elegance , and arts

But view them closer , craft and fraud appear
E'en liberty itself is barter 'd here

At gold 's superior charms all freedom flies
The needy sell it , and the rich man buys

A land of tyrants , and a den of slaves
Here wretches seek dishonourable graves

And calmly bent , to servitude conform
Dull as their lakes that slumber in the storm

Heavens ! how unlike their Belgic sires of old
Rough , poor , content , ungovernably bold

War in each breast , and freedom on each brow
How much unlike the sons of Britain now

Fir 'd at the sound , my genius spreads her wing
And flies where Britain courts the western spring

Where lawns extend that scorn Arcadian pride
And brighter streams than fam 'd Hydaspes glide

There all around the gentlest breezes stray
There gentle music melts on ev'ry spray

Creation 's mildest charms are there combined
Extremes are only in the master 's mind

Stern o'er each bosom reason holds her state
With daring aims irregularly great

Pride in their port , defiance in their eye
I see the lords of human kind pass by

Intent on high designs , a thoughtful band
By forms unfashion 'd , fresh from Nature 's hand

Fierce in their native hardiness of soul
True to imagin 'd right , above control

While e'en the peasant boasts these rights to scan
And learns to venerate himself as man

Thine , Freedom , thine the blessings pictur 'd here
Thine are those charms that dazzle and endear

Too bless 'd , indeed , were such without alloy
But foster 'd e'en by Freedom , ills annoy

That independence Britons prize too high
Keeps man from man , and breaks the social tie

The self-dependent lordlings stand alone
All claims that bind and sweeten life unknown

Here by the bonds of nature feebly held
Minds combat minds , repelling and repelled

Ferments arise , imprison 'd factions roar
Repress 'd ambition struggles round her shore

Till over-wrought , the general system feels
Its motions stop , or frenzy fire the wheels

Nor this the worst . As nature 's ties decay
As duty , love , and honour fail to sway

Fictitious bonds , the bonds of wealth and law
Still gather strength , and force unwilling awe

Hence all obedience bows to these alone
And talent sinks , and merit weeps unknown

Time may come , when stripp 'd of all her charms
The land of scholars , and the nurse of arms

Where noble stems transmit the patriot flame
Where kings have toil 'd , and poets wrote for fame

One sink of level avarice shall lie
And scholars , soldiers , kings , unhonour 'd die

Yet think not , thus when Freedom 's ills I state
I mean to flatter kings , or court the great

Ye powers of truth , that bid my soul aspire
Far from my bosom drive the low desire

And thou , fair Freedom , taught alike to feel
The rabble 's rage , and tyrant 's angry steel

Thou transitory flower , alike undone
By proud contempt , or favour 's fostering sun

Still may thy blooms the changeful clime endure
I only would repress them to secure

For just experience tells , in every soil
That those who think must govern those that toil

And all that freedom 's highest aims can reach
Is but to lay proportion 'd loads on each

Hence , should one order disproportion 'd grow
Its double weight must ruin all below

O then how blind to all that truth requires
Who think it freedom when a part aspires

Calm is my soul , nor apt to rise in arms
Except when fast-approaching danger warms

But when contending chiefs blockade the throne
Contracting regal power to stretch their own

When I behold a factious band agree
To call it freedom when themselves are free

Each wanton judge new penal statutes draw
Laws grind the poor , and rich men rule the law

The wealth of climes , where savage nations roam
Pillag 'd from slaves to purchase slaves at home

Fear , pity , justice , indignation start
Tear off reserve , and bare my swelling heart

Till half a patriot , half a coward grown
I fly from petty tyrants to the throne

Yes , brother , curse with me that baleful hour
When first ambition struck at regal power

And thus polluting honour in its source
Gave wealth to sway the mind with double force

Have we not seen , round Britain 's peopled shore
Her useful sons exchang 'd for useless ore

Seen all her triumphs but destruction haste
Like flaring tapers bright'ning as they waste

Seen opulence , her grandeur to maintain
Lead stern depopulation in her train

And over fields where scatter 'd hamlets rose
In barren solitary pomp repose

Have we not seen , at pleasure 's lordly call
The smiling long-frequented village fall

Beheld the duteous son , the sire decayed
The modest matron , and the blushing maid

Forc 'd from their homes , a melancholy train
To traverse climes beyond the western main

Where wild Oswego spreads her swamps around
And Niagara stuns with thund'ring sound

E'en now , perhaps as there some pilgrim strays
Through tangled forests , and through dangerous ways

Where beasts with man divided empire claim
And the brown Indian marks with murd'rous aim

There , while above the giddy tempest flies
And all around distressful yells arise

The pensive exile , bending with his woe
To stop too fearful , and too faint to go

Casts a long look where England 's glories shine
And bids his bosom sympathise with mine

Vain , very vain , my weary search to find
That bliss which only centres in the mind

Why have I stray 'd from pleasure and repose
To seek a good each government bestows

In every government , though terrors reign
Though tyrant kings , or tyrant laws restrain

How small , of all that human hearts endure
That part which laws or kings can cause or cure

Still to ourselves in every place consigned
Our own felicity we make or find

With secret course , which no loud storms annoy
Glides the smooth current of domestic joy

The lifted axe , the agonising wheel
Luke 's iron crown , and Damiens ' bed of steel

To men remote from power but rarely known
Leave reason , faith , and conscience all our own

SWEET AUBURN ! loveliest village of the plain
Where health and plenty cheer 'd the labouring swain

Where smiling spring its earliest visit paid
And parting summer 's lingering blooms delayed

Dear lovely bowers of innocence and ease
Seats of my youth , when every sport could please

How often have I loiter 'd o'er thy green
Where humble happiness endear 'd each scene

How often have I paus 'd on every charm
The shelter 'd cot , the cultivated farm

The never-failing brook , the busy mill
The decent church that topp 'd the neighbouring hill

The hawthorn bush , with seats beneath the shade
For talking age and whisp'ring lovers made

How often have I bless 'd the coming day
When toil remitting lent its turn to play

And all the village train , from labour free
Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree

While many a pastime circled in the shade
The young contending as the old surveyed

And many a gambol frolick 'd o'er the ground
And sleights of art and feats of strength went round

And still as each repeated pleasure tired
Succeeding sports the mirthful band inspired

The dancing pair that simply sought renown
By holding out to tire each other down

The swain mistrustless of his smutted face
While secret laughter titter 'd round the place

The bashful virgin 's side-long looks of love
The matron 's glance that would those looks reprove

These were thy charms , sweet village ; sports like these
With sweet succession , taught e'en toil to please

These round thy bowers their cheerful influence shed
These were thy charms -- But all these charms are fled

Sweet smiling village , loveliest of the lawn
Thy sports are fled , and all thy charms withdrawn

Amidst thy bowers the tyrant 's hand is seen
And desolation saddens all thy green

One only master grasps the whole domain
And half a tillage stints thy smiling plain

No more thy glassy brook reflects the day
But chok 'd with sedges , works its weedy way

Along thy glades , a solitary guest
The hollow-sounding bittern guards its nest

Amidst thy desert walks the lapwing flies
And tires their echoes with unvaried cries

Sunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all
And the long grass o'ertops the mould'ring wall

And trembling , shrinking from the spoiler 's hand
Far , far away , thy children leave the land

Ill fares the land , to hast'ning ills a prey
Where wealth accumulates , and men decay

Princes and lords may flourish , or may fade
A breath can make them , as a breath has made

But a bold peasantry , their country 's pride
When once destroy 'd , can never be supplied

A time there was , ere England 's griefs began
When every rood of ground maintain 'd its man

For him light labour spread her wholesome store
Just gave what life requir 'd , but gave no more

His best companions , innocence and health
And his best riches , ignorance of wealth

But times are alter 'd ; trade 's unfeeling train
Usurp the land and dispossess the swain

Along the lawn , where scatter 'd hamlets rose
Unwieldy wealth , and cumbrous pomp repose

And every want to opulence allied
And every pang that folly pays to pride

Those gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom
Those calm desires that ask 'd but little room

Those healthful sports that grac 'd the peaceful scene
Liv 'd in each look , and brighten 'd all the green

These , far departing , seek a kinder shore
And rural mirth and manners are no more

Sweet AUBURN ! parent of the blissful hour
Thy glades forlorn confess the tyrant 's power

Here as I take my solitary rounds
Amidst thy tangling walks , and ruin 'd grounds

And , many a year elaps 'd , return to view
Where once the cottage stood , the hawthorn grew

Remembrance wakes with all her busy train
Swells at my breast , and turns the past to pain

In all my wand'rings round this world of care
In all my griefs -- and GOD has given my share

I still had hopes my latest hours to crown
Amidst these humble bowers to lay me down

To husband out life 's taper at the close
And keep the flame from wasting by repose

I still had hopes , for pride attends us still
Amidst the swains to show my book-learn 'd skill

Around my fire an evening group to draw
And tell of all I felt , and all I saw

And , as a hare , whom hounds and horns pursue
Pants to the place from whence at first she flew

I still had hopes , my long vexations passed
Here to return -- and die at home at last

O blest retirement , friend to life 's decline
Retreats from care , that never must be mine

How happy he who crowns in shades like these
A youth of labour with an age of ease

Who quits a world where strong temptations try
And , since 't is hard to combat , learns to fly

For him no wretches , born to work and weep
Explore the mine , or tempt the dangerous deep

No surly porter stands in guilty state
To spurn imploring famine from the gate

But on he moves to meet his latter end
Angels around befriending Virtue 's friend

Bends to the grave with unperceiv 'd decay
While Resignation gently slopes the way

And , all his prospects bright'ning to the last
His Heaven commences ere the world be passed

Sweet was the sound , when oft at evening 's close
Up yonder hill the village murmur rose

There , as I pass 'd with careless steps and slow
The mingling notes came soften 'd from below

The swain responsive as the milk-maid sung
The sober herd that low 'd to meet their young

The noisy geese that gabbled o'er the pool
The playful children just let loose from school

The watchdog 's voice that bay 'd the whisp'ring wind
And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind

These all in sweet confusion sought the shade
And fill 'd each pause the nightingale had made

But now the sounds of population fail
No cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale

No busy steps the grass-grown foot-way tread
For all the bloomy flush of life is fled

All but yon widow 'd , solitary thing
That feebly bends beside the plashy spring

She , wretched matron , forc 'd in age , for bread
To strip the brook with mantling cresses spread

To pick her wintry faggot from the thorn
To seek her nightly shed , and weep till morn

She only left of all the harmless train
The sad historian of the pensive plain

Near yonder copse , where once the garden smiled
And still where many a garden flower grows wild

There , where a few torn shrubs the place disclose
The village preacher 's modest mansion rose

A man he was to all the country dear
And passing rich with forty pounds a year

Remote from towns he ran his godly race
Nor e'er had chang 'd , nor wished to change his place

Unpractis 'd he to fawn , or seek for power
By doctrines fashion 'd to the varying hour

Far other aims his heart had learned to prize
More skill 'd to raise the wretched than to rise

His house was known to all the vagrant train
He chid their wand'rings , but reliev 'd their pain

The long-remember 'd beggar was his guest
Whose beard descending swept his aged breast

The ruin 'd spendthrift , now no longer proud
Claim 'd kindred there , and had his claims allowed

The broken soldier , kindly bade to stay
Sat by his fire , and talk 'd the night away

Wept o'er his wounds , or tales of sorrow done
Shoulder 'd his crutch , and show 'd how fields were won

Pleas 'd with his guests , the good man learn 'd to glow
And quite forgot their vices in their woe

Careless their merits , or their faults to scan
His pity gave ere charity began

Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride
And e'en his failings lean 'd to Virtue 's side

But in his duty prompt at every call
He watch 'd and wept , he pray 'd and felt , for all

And , as a bird each fond endearment tries
To tempt its new-fledg 'd offspring to the skies

He tried each art , reprov 'd each dull delay
Allur 'd to brighter worlds , and led the way

Beside the bed where parting life was laid
And sorrow , guilt , and pain , by turns dismayed

The reverend champion stood . At his control
Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul

Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise
And his last falt'ring accents whisper 'd praise

At church , with meek and unaffected grace
His looks adorn 'd the venerable place

Truth from his lips prevail 'd with double sway
And fools , who came to scoff , remain 'd to pray

The service pass 'd , around the pious man
With steady zeal , each honest rustic ran

Even children follow 'd with endearing wile
And pluck 'd his gown , to share the good man 's smile

His ready smile a parent 's warmth expressed
Their welfare pleas 'd him , and their cares distressed

To them his heart , his love , his griefs were given
But all his serious thoughts had rest in Heaven

As some tall cliff , that lifts its awful form
Swells from the vale , and midway leaves the storm

Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread
Eternal sunshine settles on its head

Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way
With blossom 'd furze unprofitably gay

There , in his noisy mansion , skill 'd to rule
The village master taught his little school

A man severe he was , and stern to view
I knew him well , and every truant knew

Well had the boding tremblers learn 'd to trace
The day 's disasters in his morning face

Full well they laugh 'd , with counterfeited glee
At all his jokes , for many a joke had he

Full well the busy whisper , circling round
Convey 'd the dismal tidings when he frowned

Yet he was kind ; or if severe in aught
The love he bore to learning was in fault

The village all declar 'd how much he knew
'T was certain he could write , and cypher too

Lands he could measure , terms and tides presage
And e'en the story ran that he could gauge

In arguing too , the parson own 'd his skill
For e'en though vanquish 'd , he could argue still

While words of learned length and thund'ring sound
Amazed the gazing rustics rang 'd around

And still they gaz 'd , and still the wonder grew
That one small head could carry all he knew

But past is all his fame . The very spot
Where many a time he triumph 'd , is forgot

Near yonder thorn , that lifts its head on high
Where once the sign-post caught the passing eye

Low lies that house where nut-brown draughts inspired
Where grey-beard mirth and smiling toil retired

Where village statesmen talk 'd with looks profound
And news much older than their ale went round

Imagination fondly stoops to trace
The parlour splendours of that festive place

The white-wash 'd wall , the nicely sanded floor
The varnish 'd clock that click 'd behind the door

The chest contriv 'd a double debt to pay
A bed by night , a chest of drawers by day

The pictures plac 'd for ornament and use
The twelve good rules , the royal game of goose

The hearth , except when winter chill 'd the day
With aspen boughs , and flowers , and fennel gay

While broken tea-cups , wisely kept for show
Rang 'd o'er the chimney , glisten 'd in a row

Vain , transitory splendours ! Could not all
Reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall

Obscure it sinks , nor shall it more impart
An hour 's importance to the poor man 's heart

Thither no more the peasant shall repair
To sweet oblivion of his daily care

No more the farmer 's news , the barber 's tale
No more the wood-man 's ballad shall prevail

No more the smith his dusky brown shall clear
Relax his pond'rous strength , and lean to hear

The host himself no longer shall be found
Careful to see the mantling bliss go round

Nor the coy maid , half willing to be pressed
Shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest

Yes ! let the rich deride , the proud disdain
These simple blessings of the lowly train

To me more dear , congenial to my heart
One native charm , than all the gloss of art

Spontaneous joys , where Nature has its play
The soul adopts , and owns their first-born sway

Lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind
Unenvied , unmolested , unconfined

But the long pomp , the midnight masquerade
With all the freaks of wanton wealth arrayed

In these , ere triflers half their wish obtain
The toiling pleasure sickens into pain

And , e'en while fashion 's brightest arts decoy
The heart distrusting asks , if this be joy

Ye friends to truth , ye statesmen , who survey
The rich man 's joys increase , the poor 's decay

'T is yours to judge , how wide the limits stand
Between a splendid and a happy land

Proud swells the tide with loads of freighted ore
And shouting Folly hails them from her shore

Hoards , e'en beyond the miser 's wish abound
And rich men flock from all the world around

Yet count our gains . This wealth is but a name
That leaves our useful products still the same

Nor so the loss . The man of wealth and pride
Takes up a space that many poor supplied

Space for his lake , his park 's extended bounds
Space for his horses , equipage , and hounds

The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth
Has robb 'd the neighbouring fields of half their growth

His seat , where solitary sports are seen
Indignant spurns the cottage from the green

Around the world each needful product flies
For all the luxuries the world supplies

While thus the land adorn 'd for pleasure , all
In barren splendour feebly waits the fall

As some fair female unadorn 'd and plain
Secure to please while youth confirms her reign

Slights every borrow 'd charm that dress supplies
Nor shares with art the triumph of her eyes

But when those charms are pass 'd , for charms are frail
When time advances , and when lovers fail

She then shines forth , solicitous to bless
In all the glaring impotence of dress

Thus fares the land , by luxury betrayed
In nature 's simplest charms at first arrayed

But verging to decline , its splendours rise
Its vistas strike , its palaces surprise

While scourg 'd by famine from the smiling land
The mournful peasant leads his humble band

And while he sinks , without one arm to save
The country blooms -- a garden , and a grave

Where then , ah ! where , shall poverty reside
To 'scape the pressure of continuous pride

If to some common 's fenceless limits strayed
He drives his flock to pick the scanty blade

Those fenceless fields the sons of wealth divide
And e'en the bare-worn common is denied

If to the city sped -- What waits him there
To see profusion that he must not share

To see ten thousand baneful arts combined
To pamper luxury , and thin mankind

To see those joys the sons of pleasure know
Extorted from his fellow creature 's woe

Here , while the courtier glitters in brocade
There the pale artist plies the sickly trade

Here , while the proud their long-drawn pomps display
There the black gibbet glooms beside the way

The dome where Pleasure holds her midnight reign
Here , richly deck 'd , admits the gorgeous train

Tumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing square
The rattling chariots clash , the torches glare

Sure scenes like these no troubles e'er annoy
Sure these denote one universal joy

Are these thy serious thoughts ? -- Ah , turn thine eyes
Where the poor houseless shiv'ring female lies

She once , perhaps , in village plenty blessed
Has wept at tales of innocence distressed

Her modest looks the cottage might adorn
Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn

Now lost to all ; her friends , her virtue fled
Near her betrayer 's door she lays her head

And , pinch 'd with cold , and shrinking from the shower
With heavy heart deplores that luckless hour

When idly first , ambitious of the town
She left her wheel and robes of country brown

Do thine , sweet AUBURN , thine , the loveliest train
Do thy fair tribes participate her pain

E'en now , perhaps by cold and hunger led
At proud men 's doors they ask a little bread

Ah , no . To distant climes , a dreary scene
Where half the convex world intrudes between

Through torrid tracts with fainting steps they go
Where wild Altama murmurs to their woe

Far different there from all that charm 'd before
The various terrors of that horrid shore

Those blazing suns that dart a downward ray
And fiercely shed intolerable day

Those matted woods where birds forget to sing
But silent bats in drowsy clusters cling

Those pois'nous fields with rank luxuriance crowned
Where the dark scorpion gathers death around

Where at each step the stranger fears to wake
The rattling terrors of the vengeful snake

Where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey
And savage men more murd'rous still than they

While oft in whirls the mad tornado flies
Mingling the ravag 'd landscape with the skies

Far different these from every former scene
The cooling brook , the grassy-vested green

The breezy covert of the warbling grove
That only shelter 'd thefts of harmless love

Good heaven ! what sorrows gloom 'd that parting day
That call 'd them from their native walks away

When the poor exiles , every pleasure passed
Hung round their bowers , and fondly look 'd their last

And took a long farewell , and wish 'd in vain
For seats like these beyond the western main

And shudd'ring still to face the distant deep
Return 'd and wept , and still return 'd to weep

The good old sire , the first prepar 'd to go
To new-found worlds , and wept for others ' woe

But for himself , in conscious virtue brave
He only wish 'd for worlds beyond the grave

His lovely daughter , lovlier in her tears
The fond companion of his helpless years

Silent went next , neglectful of her charms
And left a lover 's for a father 's arms

With louder plaints the mother spoke her woes
And bless 'd the cot where every pleasure rose

And kiss 'd her thoughtless babes with many a tear
And clasp 'd them close , in sorrow doubly dear

Whilst her fond husband strove to lend relief
In all the silent manliness of grief

O Luxury ! thou curs 'd by Heaven 's decree
How ill exchang 'd are things like these for thee

How do thy potions , with insidious joy
Diffuse their pleasures only to destroy

Kingdoms , by thee , to sickly greatness grown
Boast of a florid vigour not their own

At every draught more large and large they grow
A bloated mass of rank unwieldy woe

Till sapp 'd their strength , and every part unsound
Down , down they sink , and spread a ruin round

E'en now the devastation is begun
And half the business of destruction done

E'en now , methinks , as pond'ring here I stand
I see the rural virtues leave the land

Down where yon anchoring vessel spreads the sail
That idly waiting flaps with ev'ry gale

Downward they move , a melancholy band
Pass from the shore , and darken all the strand

Contented toil , and hospitable care
And kind connubial tenderness , are there

And piety , with wishes plac 'd above
And steady loyalty , and faithful love

And thou , sweet Poetry , thou loveliest maid
Still first to fly where sensual joys invade

Unfit in these degenerate times of shame
To catch the heart , or strike for honest fame

Dear charming nymph , neglected and decried
My shame in crowds , my solitary pride

Thou source of all my bliss , and all my woe
That found'st me poor at first , and keep'st me so

Thou guide by which the nobler arts excel
Thou nurse of every virtue , fare thee well

Farewell , and Oh ! where'er thy voice be tried
On Torno 's cliffs , or Pambamarca 's side

Whether where equinoctial fervours glow
Or winter wraps the polar world in snow

Still let thy voice , prevailing over time
Redress the rigours of th ' inclement clime

Aid slighted truth ; with thy persuasive strain
Teach erring man to spurn the rage of gain

Teach him , that states of native strength possessed
Though very poor , may still be very blessed

That trade 's proud empire hastes to swift decay
As ocean sweeps the labour 'd mole away

While self-dependent power can time defy
As rocks resist the billows and the sky

WHAT ! no way left to shun th ' inglorious stage
And save from infamy my sinking age

Scarce half alive , oppress 'd with many a year
What in the name of dotage drives me here

A time there was , when glory was my guide
Nor force nor fraud could turn my steps aside

Unaw 'd by pow ' r , and unappall 'd by fear
With honest thrift I held my honour dear

But this vile hour disperses all my store
And all my hoard of honour is no more

For ah ! too partial to my life 's decline
Caesar persuades , submission must be mine

Him I obey , whom heaven itself obeys
Hopeless of pleasing , yet inclin 'd to please

Here then at once , I welcome every shame
And cancel at threescore a life of fame

No more my titles shall my children tell
The old buffoon will fit my name as well

This day beyond its term my fate extends
For life is ended when our honour ends

LOGICIANS have but ill defined
As rational , the human kind

Reason , they say , belongs to man
But let them prove it if they can

Wise Aristotle and Smiglecius
By ratiocinations specious

Have strove to prove with great precision
With definition and division

'Homo est ratione praeditum
But for my soul I can not credit 'em

And must in spite of them maintain
That man and all his ways are vain

And that this boasted lord of nature
Is both a weak and erring creature

That instinct is a surer guide
Than reason-boasting mortals ' pride

And that brute beasts are far before 'em
'Deus est anima brutorum

Who ever knew an honest brute
At law his neighbour prosecute

Bring action for assault and battery
Or friend beguile with lies and flattery

O'er plains they ramble unconfined
No politics disturb their mind

They eat their meals , and take their sport
Nor know who 's in or out at court

They never to the levee go
To treat as dearest friend , a foe

They never importune his grace
Nor ever cringe to men in place

Nor undertake a dirty job
Nor draw the quill to write for B -- b

Fraught with invective they ne'er go
To folks at Pater-Noster-Row

No judges , fiddlers , dancing-masters
No pick-pockets , or poetasters

Are known to honest quadrupeds
No single brute his fellow leads

Brutes never meet in bloody fray
Nor cut each others ' throats , for pay

Of beasts , it is confess 'd , the ape
Comes nearest us in human shape

Like man he imitates each fashion
And malice is his ruling passion

But both in malice and grimaces
A courtier any ape surpasses

Behold him humbly cringing wait
Upon a minister of state

View him soon after to inferiors
Aping the conduct of superiors

He promises with equal air
And to perform takes equal care

He in his turn finds imitators
At court , the porters , lacqueys , waiters

Their master 's manners still contract
And footmen , lords and dukes can act

Thus at the court both great an small
Behave alike -- for all ape all

WHERE the Red Lion flaring o'er the way
Invites each passing stranger that can pay

Where Calvert 's butt , and Parsons ' black champagne
Regale the drabs and bloods of Drury-lane

There in a lonely room , from bailiffs snug
The Muse found Scroggen stretch 'd beneath a rug

A window , patch 'd with paper , lent a ray
That dimly show 'd the state in which he lay

The sanded floor that grits beneath the tread
The humid wall with paltry pictures spread

The royal game of goose was there in view
And the twelve rules the royal martyr drew

The seasons , fram 'd with listing , found a place
And brave prince William show 'd his lamp-black face

The morn was cold , he views with keen desire
The rusty grate unconscious of a fire

With beer and milk arrears the frieze was scored
And five crack 'd teacups dress 'd the chimney board

A nightcap deck 'd his brows instead of bay
A cap by night -- a stocking all the day

FOR you , bright fair , the nine address their lays
And tune my feeble voice to sing thy praise

The heartfelt power of every charm divine
Who can withstand their all-commanding shine

See how she moves along with every grace
While soul-brought tears steal down each shining face

She speaks ! 't is rapture all , and nameless bliss
Ye gods ! what transport e'er compared to this

As when in Paphian groves the Queen of Love
With fond complaint addressed the listening Jove

'T was joy , and endless blisses all around
And rocks forgot their hardness at the sound

Then first , at last even Jove was taken in
And felt her charms , without disguise , within

LET not the 'hungry ' Bavius ' angry stroke
Awake resentment , or your rage provoke

But pitying his distress , let virtue shine
And giving each your bounty , 'let him dine

For thus retain 'd , as learned counsel can
Each case , however bad , he 'll new japan

And by a quick transition , plainly show
'T was no defect of yours , but 'pocket low

'T WAS you , or I , or he , or all together
'T was one , both , three of them , they know not whether

This , I believe , between us great or small
You , I , he , wrote it not -- 't was Churchill 's all

SECLUDED from domestic strife
Jack Book-worm led a college life

A fellowship at twenty-five
Made him the happiest man alive

He drank his glass and crack 'd his joke
And freshmen wonder 'd as he spoke

Such pleasures , unalloy 'd with care
Could any accident impair

Could Cupid 's shaft at length transfix
Our swain , arriv 'd at thirty-six

O had the archer ne'er come down
To ravage in a country town

Or Flavia been content to stop
At triumphs in a Fleet-street shop

O had her eyes forgot to blaze
Or Jack had wanted eyes to gaze

O ! -- But let exclamation cease
Her presence banish 'd all his peace

So with decorum all things carried
Miss frown 'd , and blush 'd , and then was -- married

Need we expose to vulgar sight
The raptures of the bridal night

Need we intrude on hallow 'd ground
Or draw the curtains clos 'd around

Let it suffice , that each had charms
He clasp 'd a goddess in his arms

And though she felt his usage rough
Yet in a man 't was well enough

The honey-moon like lightning flew
The second brought its transports too

A third , a fourth , were not amiss
The fifth was friendship mix 'd with bliss

But when a twelvemonth pass 'd away
Jack found his goddess made of clay

Found half the charms that deck 'd her face
Arose from powder , shreds , or lace

But still the worst remain 'd behind
That very face had robb 'd her mind

Skill 'd in no other arts was she
But dressing , patching , repartee

And , just as humour rose or fell
By turns a slattern or a belle

'T is true she dress 'd with modern grace
Half naked at a ball or race

But when at home , at board or bed
Five greasy nightcaps wrapp 'd her head

Could so much beauty condescend
To be a dull domestic friend

Could any curtain-lectures bring
To decency so fine a thing

In short , by night , 't was fits or fretting
By day , 't was gadding or coquetting

Fond to be seen , she kept a bevy
Of powder 'd coxcombs at her levy

The 'squire and captain took their stations
And twenty other near relations

Jack suck 'd his pipe , and often broke
A sigh in suffocating smoke

While all their hours were pass 'd between
Insulting repartee or spleen

Thus as her faults each day were known
He thinks her features coarser grown

He fancies every vice she shows
Or thins her lip , or points her nose

Whenever rage or envy rise
How wide her mouth , how wild her eyes

He knows not how , but so it is
Her face is grown a knowing phiz

And , though her fops are wond'rous civil
He thinks her ugly as the devil

Now , to perplex the ravell 'd noose
As each a different way pursues

While sullen or loquacious strife
Promis 'd to hold them on for life

That dire disease , whose ruthless power
Withers the beauty 's transient flower

Lo ! the small-pox , whose horrid glare
Levell 'd its terrors at the fair

And , rifling ev'ry youthful grace
Left but the remnant of a face

The glass , grown hateful to her sight
Reflected now a perfect fright

Each former art she vainly tries
To bring back lustre to her eyes

In vain she tries her paste and creams
To smooth her skin , or hide its seams

Her country beaux and city cousins
Lovers no more , flew off by dozens

The 'squire himself was seen to yield
And e'en the captain quit the field

Poor Madam , now condemn 'd to hack
The rest of life with anxious Jack

Perceiving others fairly flown
Attempted pleasing him alone

Jack soon was dazzl 'd to behold
Her present face surpass the old

With modesty her cheeks are dyed
Humility displaces pride

For tawdry finery is seen
A person ever neatly clean

No more presuming on her sway
She learns good-nature every day

Serenely gay , and strict in duty
Jack finds his wife a perfect beauty

LONG had I sought in vain to find
A likeness for the scribbling kind

The modern scribbling kind , who write
In wit , and sense , and nature 's spite

Till reading , I forget what day on
A chapter out of Tooke 's Pantheon

I think I met with something there
To suit my purpose to a hair

But let us not proceed too furious
First please to turn to god Mercurius

You 'll find him pictur 'd at full length
In book the second , page the tenth

The stress of all my proofs on him I lay
And now proceed we to our simile

Imprimis , pray observe his hat
Wings upon either side -- mark that

Well ! what is it from thence we gather
Why these denote a brain of feather

A brain of feather ! very right
With wit that 's flighty , learning light

Such as to modern bard 's decreed
A just comparison , -- proceed

In the next place , his feet peruse
Wings grow again from both his shoes

Design 'd , no doubt , their part to bear
And waft his godship through the air

And here my simile unites
For in a modern poet 's flights

I 'm sure it may be justly said
His feet are useful as his head

Lastly , vouchsafe t'observe his hand
Filled with a snake-encircl 'd wand

By classic authors term 'd caduceus
And highly fam 'd for several uses

To wit -- most wond'rously endued
No poppy water half so good

For let folks only get a touch
Its soporific virtue 's such

Though ne'er so much awake before
That quickly they begin to snore

Add too , what certain writers tell
With this he drives men 's souls to hell

Now to apply , begin we then
His wand 's a modern author 's pen

The serpents round about it twined
Denote him of the reptile kind

Denote the rage with which he writes
His frothy slaver , venom 'd bites

An equal semblance still to keep
Alike too both conduce to sleep

This diff'rence only , as the god
Drove souls to Tart'rus with his rod

With his goosequill the scribbling elf
Instead of others , damns himself

And here my simile almost tript
Yet grant a word by way of postscript

Moreover , Merc'ry had a failing
Well ! what of that ? out with it -- stealing

In which all modern bards agree
Being each as great a thief as he

But ev'n this deity 's existence
Shall lend my simile assistance

Our modern bards ! why what a pox
Are they but senseless stones and blocks

As puffing quacks some caitiff wretch procure
To swear the pill , or drop , has wrought a cure

Thus on the stage , our play-wrights still depend
For Epilogues and Prologues on some friend

Who knows each art of coaxing up the town
And make full many a bitter pill go down

Conscious of this , our bard has gone about
And teas 'd each rhyming friend to help him out

'An Epilogue -- things ca n't go on without it
It could not fail , would you but set about it

'Young man , ' cries one -- a bard laid up in clover
'Alas , young man , my writing days are over

Let boys play tricks , and kick the straw ; not I
Your brother Doctor there , perhaps , may try

'What I ? dear Sir , ' the Doctor interposes
'What plant my thistle , Sir , among his roses

No , no ; I 've other contests to maintain
To-night I head our troops at Warwick Lane

Go , ask your manager . ' 'Who , me ? Your pardon
Those things are not our forte at Covent Garden

Our Author 's friends , thus plac 'd at happy distance
Give him good words indeed , but no assistance

As some unhappy wight , at some new play
At the Pit door stands elbowing a way

While oft , with many a smile , and many a shrug
He eyes the centre , where his friends sit snug

His simp'ring friends , with pleasure in their eyes
Sink as he sinks , and as he rises rise

He nods , they nod ; he cringes , they grimace
But not a soul will budge to give him place

Since then , unhelp 'd , our bard must now conform
'To 'bide the pelting of this pitiless storm

Blame where you must , be candid where you can
And be each critic the 'Good Natur 'd Man

WHAT ! five long acts -- and all to make us wiser
Our authoress sure has wanted an adviser

Had she consulted 'me ' , she should have made
Her moral play a speaking masquerade

Warm 'd up each bustling scene , and in her rage
Have emptied all the green-room on the stage

My life o n't , this had kept her play from sinking
Have pleas 'd our eyes , and sav 'd the pain of thinking

Well ! since she thus has shown her want of skill
What if I give a masquerade ? -- I will

Statesmen with bridles on ; and , close beside 'em
Patriots , in party-coloured suits , that ride 'em

There Hebes , turn 'd of fifty , try once more
To raise a flame in Cupids of threescore

These in their turn , with appetites as keen
Deserting fifty , fasten on fifteen

Miss , not yet full fifteen , with fire uncommon
Flings down her sampler , and takes up the woman

The little urchin smiles , and spreads her lure
And tries to kill , ere she 's got power to cure

Thus 't is with all -- their chief and constant care
Is to seem everything but what they are

Yon broad , bold , angry spark , I fix my eye on
Who seems to have robb 'd his vizor from the lion

Who frowns , and talks , and swears , with round parade
Looking as who should say , D__ __ ! who 's afraid

Strip but his vizor off , and sure I am
You 'll find his lionship a very lamb

Yon politician , famous in debate
Perhaps , to vulgar eyes , bestrides the state

Yet , when he deigns his real shape t ' assume
He turns old woman , and bestrides a broom

Yon patriot , too , who presses on your sight
And seems to every gazer all in white

If with a bribe his candour you attack
He bows , turns round , and whip -- the man 's a black

Yon critic , too -- but whither do I run
If I proceed , our bard will be undone

Well then a truce , since she requests it too
Do you spare her , and I 'll for once spare you

IN these bold times , when Learning 's sons explore
The distant climate and the savage shore

When wise Astronomers to India steer
And quit for Venus , many a brighter here

While Botanists , all cold to smiles and dimpling
Forsake the fair , and patiently -- go simpling

When every bosom swells with wond'rous scenes
Priests , cannibals , and hoity-toity queens

Our bard into the general spirit enters
And fits his little frigate for adventures

With Scythian stores , and trinkets deeply laden
He this way steers his course , in hopes of trading

Yet ere he lands he 'as ordered me before
To make an observation on the shore

Where are we driven ? our reck'ning sure is lost
This seems a barren and a dangerous coast

The place is uninhabited , I fear
I heard a hissing -- there are serpents here

O there the natives are -- a dreadful race
The men have tails , the women paint the face

No doubt they 're all barbarians . -- Yes , 't is so
I 'll try to make palaver with them though

'T is best , however , keeping at a distance
Good Savages , our Captain craves assistance

Our ship 's well stor 'd ; -- in yonder creek we 've laid her
His honour is no mercenary trader

This is his first adventure ; lend him aid
Or you may chance to spoil a thriving trade

His goods , he hopes are prime , and brought from far
Equally fit for gallantry and war

What ! no reply to promises so ample
I 'd best step back -- and order up a sample

WELL , having stoop 'd to conquer with success
And gain 'd a husband without aid from dress

Still , as a Bar-maid , I could wish it too
As I have conquer 'd him , to conquer you

And let me say , for all your resolution
That pretty Bar-maids have done execution

Our life is all a play , compos 'd to please
'We have our exits and our entrances

The First Act shows the simple country maid
Harmless and young , of ev'ry thing afraid

Blushes when hir 'd , and , with unmeaning action
' I hopes as how to give you satisfaction

Her Second Act displays a livelier scene
Th ' unblushing Bar-maid of a country inn

Who whisks about the house , at market caters
Talks loud , coquets the guests , and scolds the waiters

Next the scene shifts to town , and there she soars
The chop-house toast of ogling connoisseurs

On 'Squires and Cits she there displays her arts
And on the gridiron broils her lovers ' hearts

And as she smiles , her triumphs to complete
Even Common-Councilmen forget to eat

The Fourth Act shows her wedded to the 'Squire
And Madam now begins to hold it higher

Pretends to taste , at Operas cries 'caro
And quits her 'Nancy Dawson ' , for 'Che faro

Doats upon dancing , and in all her pride
Swims round the room , the Heinel of Cheapside

Ogles and leers with artificial skill
'Till having lost in age the power to kill

Such , through our lives , the eventful history
The Fifth and Last Act still remains for me

The Bar-maid now for your protection prays
Turns Female Barrister , and pleads for Bayes

OF old , when Scarron his companions invited
Each guest brought his dish , and the feast was united

If our landlord supplies us with beef , and with fish
Let each guest bring himself , and he brings the best dish

Our Dean shall be venison , just fresh from the plains
Our Burke shall be tongue , with a garnish of brains

Our Will shall be wild-fowl , of excellent flavour
And Dick with his pepper shall heighten their savour

Our Cumberland 's sweet-bread its place shall obtain
And Douglas is pudding , substantial and plain

Our Garrick 's a salad ; for in him we see
Oil , vinegar , sugar , and saltness agree

To make out the dinner , full certain I am
That Ridge is anchovy , and Reynolds is lamb

That Hickey 's a capon , and by the same rule
Magnanimous Goldsmith a gooseberry fool

At a dinner so various , at such a repast
Who 'd not be a glutton , and stick to the last

Here , waiter ! more wine , let me sit while I 'm able
Till all my companions sink under the table

Then , with chaos and blunders encircling my head
Let me ponder , and tell what I think of the dead

Here lies the good Dean , re-united to earth
Who mix 'd reason with pleasure , and wisdom with mirth

If he had any faults , he has left us in doubt
At least , in six weeks , I could not find 'em out

Yet some have declar 'd , and it ca n't be denied 'em
That sly-boots was cursedly cunning to hide 'em

Here lies our good Edmund , whose genius was such
We scarcely can praise it , or blame it too much

Who , born for the Universe , narrow 'd his mind
And to party gave up what was meant for mankind

Though fraught with all learning , yet straining his throat
To persuade Tommy Townshend to lend him a vote

Who , too deep for his hearers , still went on refining
And thought of convincing , while they thought of dining

Though equal to all things , for all things unfit
Too nice for a statesman , too proud for a wit

For a patriot , too cool ; for a drudge , disobedient
And too fond of the 'right ' to pursue the 'expedient

In short , 't was his fate , unemploy 'd , or in place , Sir
To eat mutton cold , and cut blocks with a razor

Here lies honest William , whose heart was a mint
While the owner ne'er knew half the good that was i n't

The pupil of impulse , it forc 'd him along
His conduct still right , with his argument wrong

Still aiming at honour , yet fearing to roam
The coachman was tipsy , the chariot drove home

Would you ask for his merits ? alas ! he had none
What was good was spontaneous , his faults were his own

Here lies honest Richard , whose fate I must sigh at
Alas , that such frolic should now be so quiet

What spirits were his ! what wit and what whim
Now breaking a jest , and now breaking a limb

Now wrangling and grumbling to keep up the ball
Now teasing and vexing , yet laughing at all

In short , so provoking a devil was Dick
That we wish 'd him full ten times a day at Old Nick

But , missing his mirth and agreeable vein
As often we wish 'd to have Dick back again

Here Cumberland lies , having acted his parts
The Terence of England , the mender of hearts

A flattering painter , who made it his care
To draw men as they ought to be , not as they are

His gallants are all faultless , his women divine
And comedy wonders at being so fine

Like a tragedy queen he has dizen 'd her out
Or rather like tragedy giving a rout

His fools have their follies so lost in a crowd
Of virtues and feelings , that folly grows proud

And coxcombs , alike in their failings alone
Adopting his portraits , are pleas 'd with their own

Say , where has our poet this malady caught
Or , wherefore his characters thus without fault

Say , was it that vainly directing his view
To find out men 's virtues , and finding them few

Quite sick of pursuing each troublesome elf
He grew lazy at last , and drew from himself

Here Douglas retires , from his toils to relax
The scourge of impostors , the terror of quacks

Come , all ye quack bards , and ye quacking divines
Come , and dance on the spot where your tyrant reclines

When Satire and Censure encircl 'd his throne
I fear 'd for your safety , I fear 'd for my own

But now he is gone , and we want a detector
Our Dodds shall be pious , our Kenricks shall lecture

Macpherson write bombast , and call it a style
Our Townshend make speeches , and I shall compile

New Lauders and Bowers the Tweed shall cross over
No countryman living their tricks to discover

Detection her taper shall quench to a spark
And Scotchman meet Scotchman , and cheat in the dark

Here lies David Garrick , describe me , who can
An abridgment of all that was pleasant in man

As an actor , confess 'd without rival to shine
As a wit , if not first , in the very first line

Yet , with talents like these , and an excellent heart
The man had his failings , a dupe to his art

Like an ill-judging beauty , his colours he spread
And beplaster 'd with rouge his own natural red

On the stage he was natural , simple , affecting
'T was only that when he was off he was acting

With no reason on earth to go out of his way
He turn 'd and he varied full ten times a day

Though secure of our hearts , yet confoundedly sick
If they were not his own by finessing and trick

He cast off his friends , as a huntsman his pack
For he knew when he pleas 'd he could whistle them back

Of praise a mere glutton , he swallow 'd what came
And the puff of a dunce he mistook it for fame

Till his relish grown callous , almost to disease
Who pepper 'd the highest was surest to please

But let us be candid , and speak out our mind
If dunces applauded , he paid them in kind

Ye Kenricks , ye Kellys , and Woodfalls so grave
What a commerce was yours , while you got and you gave

How did Grub-street re-echo the shouts you raised
While he was be-Roscius 'd , and you were be-praised

But peace to his spirit , wherever it flies
To act as an angel , and mix with the skies

Those poets , who owe their best fame to his skill
Shall still be his flatterers , go where he will

Old Shakespeare , receive him , with praise and with love
And Beaumonts and Bens be his Kellys above

Here Hickey reclines , a most blunt , pleasant creature
And slander itself must allow him good nature

He cherish 'd his friend , and he relish 'd a bumper
Yet one fault he had , and that one was a thumper

Perhaps you may ask if the man was a miser
I answer , no , no , for he always was wiser

Too courteous , perhaps , or obligingly flat
His very worst foe ca n't accuse him of that

Perhaps he confided in men as they go
And so was too foolishly honest ! Ah no

Then what was his failing ? come , tell it , and burn ye
He was , could he help it ? -- a special attorney

Here Reynolds is laid , and , to tell you my mind
He has not left a better or wiser behind

His pencil was striking , resistless , and grand
His manners were gentle , complying , and bland

Still born to improve us in every part
His pencil our faces , his manners our heart

To coxcombs averse , yet most civilly steering
When they judg 'd without skill he was still hard of hearing

When they talk 'd of their Raphaels , Correggios , and stuff
He shifted his trumpet , and only took snuff

HERE Whitefoord reclines , and deny it who can
Though he 'merrily ' liv 'd , he is now a 'grave ' man

Rare compound of oddity , frolic , and fun
Who relish 'd a joke , and rejoic 'd in a pun

Whose temper was generous , open , sincere
A stranger to flatt'ry , a stranger to fear

Who scatter 'd around wit and humour at will
Whose daily 'bons mots ' half a column might fill

A Scotchman , from pride and from prejudice free
A scholar , yet surely no pedant was he

What pity , alas ! that so lib'ral a mind
Should so long be to news-paper essays confined

Who perhaps to the summit of science could soar
Yet content 'if the table he set on a roar

Whose talents to fill any station were fit
Yet happy if Woodfall confess 'd him a wit

Ye news-paper witlings ! ye pert scribbling folks
Who copied his squibs , and re-echoed his jokes

Ye tame imitators , ye servile herd , come
Still follow your master , and visit his tomb

To deck it , bring with you festoons of the vine
And copious libations bestow on his shrine

Then strew all around it ( you can do no less
'Cross-readings , Ship-news ' , and 'Mistakes of the Press

Merry Whitefoord , farewell ! for 'thy ' sake I admit
That a Scot may have humour , I had almost said wit

This debt to thy mem'ry I can not refuse
'Thou best humour 'd man with the worst humour 'd muse

AH me ! when shall I marry me
Lovers are plenty ; but fail to relieve me

He , fond youth , that could carry me
Offers to love , but means to deceive me

But I will rally , and combat the ruiner
Not a look , not a smile shall my passion discover

She that gives all to the false one pursuing her
Makes but a penitent , loses a lover

CHASTE are their instincts , faithful is their fire
No foreign beauty tempts to false desire

The snow-white vesture , and the glittering crown
The simple plumage , or the glossy down

Prompt not their loves : -- the patriot bird pursues
His well acquainted tints , and kindred hues

Hence through their tribes no mix 'd polluted flame
No monster-breed to mark the groves with shame

But the chaste blackbird , to its partner true
Thinks black alone is beauty 's favourite hue

The nightingale , with mutual passion blest
Sings to its mate , and nightly charms the nest

While the dark owl to court its partner flies
And owns its offspring in their yellow eyes

THANKS , my Lord , for your venison , for finer or fatter
Never rang 'd in a forest , or smok 'd in a platter

The haunch was a picture for painters to study
The fat was so white , and the lean was so ruddy

Though my stomach was sharp , I could scarce help regretting
To spoil such a delicate picture by eating

I had thoughts , in my chambers , to place it in view
To be shown to my friends as a piece of 'virtu

As in some Irish houses , where things are so so
One gammon of bacon hangs up for a show

But for eating a rasher of what they take pride in
They 'd as soon think of eating the pan it is fried in

But hold -- let me pause -- Do n't I hear you pronounce
This tale of the bacon a damnable bounce

Well , suppose it a bounce -- sure a poet may try
By a bounce now and then , to get courage to fly

But , my Lord , it 's no bounce : I protest in my turn
It 's a truth -- and your Lordship may ask Mr. Byrne

To go on with my tale -- as I gaz 'd on the haunch
I thought of a friend that was trusty and staunch

So I cut it , and sent it to Reynolds undressed
To paint it , or eat it , just as he lik 'd best

Of the neck and the breast I had next to dispose
'T was a neck and a breast -- that might rival M -- r -- 's

But in parting with these I was puzzled again
With the how , and the who , and the where , and the when

There 's H -- d , and C -- y , and H -- rth , and H -- ff
I think they love venison -- I know they love beef

There 's my countryman H -- gg -- ns -- Oh ! let him alone
For making a blunder , or picking a bone

But hang it -- to poets who seldom can eat
Your very good mutton 's a very good treat

Such dainties to them , their health it might hurt
It 's like sending them ruffles , when wanting a shirt

While thus I debated , in reverie centred
An acquaintance , a friend as he call 'd himself , entered

An under-bred , fine-spoken fellow was he
And he smil 'd as he look 'd at the venison and me

'What have we got here ? -- Why , this is good eating
Your own , I suppose -- or is it in waiting

'Why , whose should it be ? ' cried I with a flounce
' I get these things often ; ' -- but that was a bounce

'Some lords , my acquaintance , that settle the nation
Are pleas 'd to be kind -- but I hate ostentation

'If that be the case , then , ' cried he , very gay
' I 'm glad I have taken this house in my way

To-morrow you take a poor dinner with me
No words -- I insist o n't -- precisely at three

We 'll have Johnson , and Burke ; all the wits will be there
My acquaintance is slight , or I 'd ask my Lord Clare

And now that I think o n't , as I am a sinner
We wanted this venison to make out the dinner

What say you -- a pasty ? it shall , and it must
And my wife , little Kitty , is famous for crust

Here , porter ! -- this venison with me to Mile-end
No stirring -- I beg -- my dear friend -- my dear friend

Thus snatching his hat , he brush 'd off like the wind
And the porter and eatables follow 'd behind

Left alone to reflect , having emptied my shelf
'And nobody with me at sea but myself

Though I could not help thinking my gentleman hasty
Yet Johnson , and Burke , and a good venison pasty

Were things that I never dislik 'd in my life
Though clogg 'd with a coxcomb , and Kitty his wife

So next day , in due splendour to make my approach
I drove to his door in my own hackney coach

When come to the place where we all were to dine
( A chair-lumber 'd closet just twelve feet by nine

My friend bade me welcome , but struck me quite dumb
With tidings that Johnson and Burke would not come

'For I knew it , ' he cried , 'both eternally fail
The one with his speeches , and t'other with Thrale

But no matter , I 'll warrant we 'll make up the party
With two full as clever , and ten times as hearty

The one is a Scotchman , the other a Jew
They [ 're ] both of them merry and authors like you

The one writes the 'Snarler ' , the other the 'Scourge
Some think he writes 'Cinna ' -- he own to 'Panurge

While thus he describ 'd them by trade , and by name
They enter 'd and dinner was serv 'd as they came

At the top a fried liver and bacon were seen
At the bottom was tripe in a swinging tureen

At the sides there was spinach and pudding made hot
In the middle a place where the pasty -- was not

Now , my Lord as for tripe , it 's my utter aversion
And your bacon I hate like a Turk or a Persian

So there I sat stuck , like a horse in a pound
While the bacon and liver went merrily round

But what vex 'd me most was that d -- 'd Scottish rogue
With his long-winded speeches , his smiles and his brogue

And , 'Madam , ' quoth he , 'may this bit be my poison
A prettier dinner I never set eyes on

Pray a slice of your liver , though may I be cursed
But I 've eat of your tripe till I 'm ready to burst

'The tripe , ' quoth the Jew , with his chocolate cheek
' I could dine on this tripe seven days in the week

I like these here dinners so pretty and small
But your friend there , the Doctor , eats nothing at all

' O -- Oh ! ' quoth my friend , 'he 'll come on in a trice
He 's keeping a corner for something that 's nice

There 's a pasty ' -- ' A pasty ! ' repeated the Jew
' I do n't care if I keep a corner for't too

'What the de'il , mon , a pasty ! ' re-echoed the Scot
'Though splitting , I 'll still keep a corner for thot

'We 'll all keep a corner , ' the lady cried out
'We 'll all keep a corner , ' was echoed about

While thus we resolv 'd , and the pasty delayed
With look that quite petrified , enter 'd the maid

A visage so sad , and so pale with affright
Wak 'd Priam in drawing his curtains by night

But we quickly found out , for who could mistake her
That she came with some terrible news from the baker

And so it fell out , for that negligent sloven
Had shut out the pasty on shutting his oven

Sad Philomel thus -- but let similes drop
And now that I think o n't , the story may stop

To be plain , my good Lord , it 's but labour misplaced
To send such good verses to one of your taste

You 've got an odd something -- a kind of discerning
A relish -- a taste -- sicken 'd over by learning

At least , it 's your temper , as very well known
That you think very slightly of all that 's your own

So , perhaps , in your habits of thinking amiss
You may make a mistake , and think slightly of this

THIS tomb , inscrib 'd to gentle Parnell 's name
May speak our gratitude , but not his fame

What heart but feels his sweetly-moral lay
That leads to truth through pleasure 's flowery way

Celestial themes confess 'd his tuneful aid
And Heaven , that lent him genius , was repaid

Needless to him the tribute we bestow
The transitory breath of fame below

More lasting rapture from his works shall rise
While Converts thank their poet in the skies

JOHN TROTT was desired by two witty peers
To tell them the reason why asses had ears

'A n't please you , ' quoth John , ' I 'm not given to letters
Nor dare I pretend to know more than my betters

Howe'er , from this time I shall ne'er see your graces
As I hope to be saved ! without thinking on asses

HOLD ! Prompter , hold ! a word before your nonsense
I 'd speak a word or two , to ease my conscience

My pride forbids it ever should be said
My heels eclips 'd the honours of my head

That I found humour in a piebald vest
Or ever thought that jumping was a jest

Whence , and what art thou , visionary birth
Nature disowns , and reason scorns thy mirth

In thy black aspect every passion sleeps
The joy that dimples , and the woe that weeps

How has thou fill 'd the scene with all thy brood
Of fools pursuing , and of fools pursued

Whose ins and outs no ray of sense discloses
Whose only plot it is to break our noses

Whilst from below the trap-door Demons rise
And from above the dangling deities

And shall I mix in this unhallow 'd crew
May rosined lightning blast me , if I do

No -- I will act , I 'll vindicate the stage
Shakespeare himself shall feel my tragic rage

Off ! off ! vile trappings ! a new passion reigns
The madd'ning monarch revels in my veins

Aye , 't was but a dream , for now there 's no retreating
If I cease Harlequin , I cease from eating

'T was thus that Aesop 's stag , a creature blameless
Yet something vain , like one that shall be nameless

Once on the margin of a fountain stood
And cavill 'd at his image in the flood

'The deuce confound , ' he cries , 'these drumstick shanks
They never have my gratitude nor thanks

They 're perfectly disgraceful ! strike me dead
But for a head , yes , yes , I have a head

How piercing is that eye ! how sleek that brow
My horns ! I 'm told horns are the fashion now

Whilst thus he spoke , astonish 'd , to his view
Near , and more near , the hounds and huntsmen drew

'Hoicks ! hark forward ! ' came thund'ring from behind
He bounds aloft , outstrips the fleeting wind

He quits the woods , and tries the beaten ways
He starts , he pants , he takes the circling maze

At length his silly head , so priz 'd before
Is taught his former folly to deplore

Whilst his strong limbs conspire to set him free
And at one bound he saves himself , -- like me

THERE is a place , so Ariosto sings
A treasury for lost and missing things

Lost human wits have places assign 'd them
And they , who lose their senses , there may find them

But where 's this place , this storehouse of the age
The Moon , says he : -- but ' I ' affirm the Stage

At least in many things , I think , I see
His lunar , and our mimic world agree

Both shine at night , for , but at Foote 's alone
We scarce exhibit till the sun goes down

Both prone to change , no settled limits fix
And sure the folks of both are lunatics

But in this parallel my best pretence is
That mortals visit both to find their senses

To this strange spot , Rakes , Macaronies , Cits
Come thronging to collect their scatter 'd wits

The gay coquette , who ogles all the day
Comes here at night , and goes a prude away

Hither the affected city dame advancing
Who sighs for operas , and dotes on dancing

Taught by our art her ridicule to pause on
Quits the 'Ballet ' , and calls for 'Nancy Dawson

The Gamester too , whose wit 's all high or low
Oft risks his fortune on one desperate throw

Comes here to saunter , having made his bets
Finds his lost senses out , and pay his debts

The Mohawk too -- with angry phrases stored
As 'D -- -- , Sir , ' and 'Sir , I wear a sword

Here lesson 'd for a while , and hence retreating
Goes out , affronts his man , and takes a beating

Here come the sons of scandal and of news
But find no sense -- for they had none to lose

Of all the tribe here wanting an adviser
Our Author 's the least likely to grow wiser

Has he not seen how you your favour place
On sentimental Queens and Lords in lace

Without a star , a coronet or garter
How can the piece expect or hope for quarter

No high-life scenes , no sentiment : -- the creature
Still stoops among the low to copy nature

Yes , he 's far gone : -- and yet some pity fix
The English laws forbid to punish lunatics

YOUR mandate I got
You may all go to pot

Had your senses been right
You 'd have sent before night

As I hope to be saved
I put off being shaved

For I could not make bold
While the matter was cold

To meddle in suds
Or to put on my duds

So tell Horneck and Nesbitt
And Baker and his bit

And Kauffmann beside
And the Jessamy Bride

With the rest of the crew
The Reynoldses two

Little Comedy 's face
And the Captain in lace

( By-the-bye you may tell him
I have something to sell him

Of use I insist
When he comes to enlist

Your worships must know
That a few days ago

An order went out
For the foot guards so stout

To wear tails in high taste
Twelve inches at least

Now I 've got him a scale
To measure each tail

To lengthen a short tail
And a long one to curtail

Yet how can I when vext
Thus stray from my text

Tell each other to rue
Your Devonshire crew

For sending so late
To one of my state

But 't is Reynolds 's way
From wisdom to stray

And Angelica 's whim
To be frolick like him

But , alas ! Your good worships , how could they be wiser
When both have been spoil 'd in to-day 's 'Advertiser

First let me suppose , what may shortly be true
The company set , and the word to be , Loo

All smirking , and pleasant , and big with adventure
And ogling the stake which is fix 'd in the centre

Round and round go the cards , while I inwardly damn
At never once finding a visit from Pam

I lay down my stake , apparently cool
While the harpies about me all pocket the pool

I fret in my gizzard , yet , cautious and sly
I wish all my friends may be bolder than I

Yet still they sit snug , not a creature will aim
By losing their money to venture at fame

'T is in vain that at niggardly caution I scold
'T is in vain that I flatter the brave and the bold

All play their own way , and they think me an ass
'What does Mrs . Bunbury ? ' ' I , Sir ? I pass

'Pray what does Miss Horneck ? Take courage , come do
'Who , I ? let me see , Sir , why I must pass too

Mr. Bunbury frets , and I fret like the devil
To see them so cowardly , lucky , and civil

Yet still I sit snug , and continue to sigh on
Till made by my losses as bold as a lion

I venture at all , -- while my avarice regards
The whole pool as my own -- 'Come , give me five cards

'Well done ! ' cry the ladies ; 'Ah , Doctor , that 's good
The pool 's very rich -- ah ! the Doctor is looed

Thus foil 'd in my courage , on all sides perplexed
I ask for advice from the lady that 's next

'Pray , Ma'am , be so good as to give your advice
Do n't you think the best way is to venture for 't twice

' I advise , ' cries the lady , 'to try it , I own
Ah ! the Doctor is loo 'd ! Come , Doctor , put down

Thus , playing , and playing , I still grow more eager
And so bold , and so bold , I 'm at last a bold beggar

Now , ladies , I ask , if law-matters you 're skill 'd in
Whether crimes such as yours should not come before Fielding

For giving advice that is not worth a straw
May well be call 'd picking of pockets in law

And picking of pockets , with which I now charge ye
Is , by quinto Elizabeth , Death without Clergy

What justice , when both to the Old Bailey brought
By the gods , I 'll enjoy it ; though 't is but in thought

Both are plac 'd at the bar , with all proper decorum
With bunches of fennel , and nosegays before 'em

Both cover their faces with mobs and all that
But the judge bids them , angrily , take off their hat

When uncover 'd , a buzz of enquiry runs round
'Pray what are their crimes ? ' -- 'They 've been pilfering found

'But , pray , whom have they pilfer 'd ? ' -- ' A Doctor , I hear
'What , yon solemn-faced , odd-looking man that stands near

'The same . ' -- 'What a pity ! how does it surprise one
Two handsomer culprits I never set eyes on

Then their friends all come round me with cringing and leering
To melt me to pity , and soften my swearing

First Sir Charles advances with phrases well strung
'Consider , dear Doctor , the girls are but young

'The younger the worse , ' I return him again
'It shows that their habits are all dyed in grain

'But then they 're so handsome , one 's bosom it grieves
'What signifies 'handsome ' , when people are thieves

'But where is your justice ? their cases are hard
'What signifies 'justice ' ? I want the 'reward

ARMIES of box that sportively engage
And mimic real battles in their rage

Pleased I recount ; how , smit with glory 's charms
Two mighty Monarchs met in adverse arms

Sable and white ; assist me to explore
Ye Serian Nymphs , what ne'er was sung before

No path appears : yet resolute I stray
Where youth undaunted bids me force my way

O'er rocks and cliffs while I the task pursue
Guide me , ye Nymphs , with your unerring clue

For you the rise of this diversion know
You first were pleased in Italy to show

This studious sport ; from Scacchis was its name
The pleasing record of your Sister 's fame

When Jove through Ethiopia 's parch 'd extent
To grace the nuptials of old Ocean went

Each god was there ; and mirth and joy around
To shores remote diffused their happy sound

Then when their hunger and their thirst no more
Claim 'd their attention , and the feast was o'er

Ocean with pastime to divert the thought
Commands a painted table to be brought

Sixty-four spaces fill the chequer 'd square
Eight in each rank eight equal limits share

Alike their form , but different are their dyes
They fade alternate , and alternate rise

White after black ; such various stains as those
The shelving backs of tortoises disclose

Then to the gods that mute and wondering sate
You see ( says he ) the field prepared for fate

Here will the little armies please your sight
With adverse colours hurrying to the fight

On which so oft , with silent sweet surprise
The Nymphs and Nereids used to feast their eyes

And all the neighbours of the hoary deep
When calm the sea , and winds were lull 'd asleep

But see , the mimic heroes tread the board
He said , and straightway from an urn he poured

The sculptured box , that neatly seem 'd to ape
The graceful figure of a human shape

Equal the strength and number of each foe
Sixteen appear 'd like jet , sixteen like snow

As their shape varies various is the name
Different their posts , nor is their strength the same

There might you see two Kings with equal pride
Gird on their arms , their Consorts by their side

Here the Foot-warriors glowing after fame
There prancing Knights and dexterous Archers came

And Elephants , that on their backs sustain
Vast towers of war , and fill and shake the plain

And now both hosts , preparing for the storm
Of adverse battle , their encampments form

In the fourth space , and on the farthest line
Directly opposite the Monarchs shine

The swarthy on white ground , on sable stands
The silver King ; and then they send commands

Nearest to these the Queens exert their might
One the left side , and t'other guards the right

Where each , by her respective armour known
Chooses the colour that is like her own

Then the young Archers , two that snowy-white
Bend the tough yew , and two as black as night

( Greece call 'd them Mars 's favourites heretofore
From their delight in war , and thirst of gore

These on each side the Monarch and his Queen
Surround obedient ; next to these are seen

The crested Knights in golden armour gay
Their steeds by turns curvet , or snort or neigh

In either army on each distant wing
Two mighty Elephants their castles bring

Bulwarks immense ! and then at last combine
Eight of the Foot to form the second line

The vanguard to the King and Queen ; from far
Prepared to open all the fate of war

So moved the boxen hosts , each double-lined
Their different colours floating in the wind

As if an army of the Gauls should go
With their white standards , o'er the Alpine snow

To meet in rigid fight on scorching sands
The sun-burnt Moors and Memnon 's swarthy bands

Then Father Ocean thus ; you see them here
Celestial powers , what troops , what camps appear

Learn now the sev'ral orders of the fray
For e'en these arms their stated laws obey

To lead the fight , the Kings from all their bands
Choose whom they please to bear their great commands

Should a black hero first to battle go
Instant a white one guards against the blow

Their gen'ral purpose on one scheme is bent
So to besiege the King within the tent

That there remains no place by subtle flight
From danger free ; and that decides the fight

Meanwhile , howe'er , the sooner to destroy
Th ' imperial Prince , remorseless they employ

Their swords in blood ; and whosoever dare
Oppose their vengeance , in the ruin share

Fate thins their camp ; the parti-coloured field
Widens apace , as they o'ercome or yield

But the proud victor takes the captive 's post
There fronts the fury of th ' avenging host

One single shock : and ( should he ward the blow
May then retire at pleasure from the foe

The Foot alone ( so their harsh laws ordain
When they proceed can ne'er return again

But neither all rush on alike to prove
The terror of their arms : The Foot must move

Directly on , and but a single square
Yet may these heroes , when they first prepare

To mix in combat on the bloody mead
Double their sally , and two steps proceed

But when they wound , their swords they subtly guide
With aim oblique , and slanting pierce his side

But the great Indian beasts , whose backs sustain
Vast turrets arm 'd , when on the redd'ning plain

They join in all the terror of the fight
Forward or backward , to the left or right

Run furious , and impatient of confine
Scour through the field , and threat the farthest line

Yet must they ne'er obliquely aim their blows
That only manner is allow 'd to those

Whom Mars has favour 'd most , who bend the stubborn bows
These glancing sidewards in a straight career

Yet each confin 'd to their respective sphere
Or white or black , can send th ' unerring dart

Wing 'd with swift death to pierce through ev'ry part
The fiery steed , regardless of the reins

Comes prancing on ; but sullenly disdains
The path direct , and boldly wheeling round

Leaps o'er a double space at ev'ry bound
And shifts from white or black to diff'rent colour 'd ground

But the fierce Queen , whom dangers ne'er dismay
The strength and terror of the bloody day

In a straight line spreads her destruction wide
To left or right , before , behind , aside

Yet may she never with a circling course
Sweep to the battle like the fretful Horse

But unconfin 'd may at her pleasure stray
If neither friend nor foe block up the way

For to o'erleap a warrior , 't is decreed
Those only dare who curb the snorting steed

With greater caution and majestic state
The warlike Monarchs in the scene of fate

Direct their motions , since for these appear
Zealous each hope , and anxious ev'ry fear

While the King 's safe , with resolution stern
They clasp their arms ; but should a sudden turn

Make him a captive , instantly they yield
Resolved to share his fortune in the field

He moves on slow ; with reverence profound
His faithful troops encompass him around

And oft , to break some instant fatal scheme
Rush to their fates , their sov'reign to redeem

While he , unanxious where to wound the foe
Need only shift and guard against a blow

But none , however , can presume t ' appear
Within his reach , but must his vengeance fear

For he on ev'ry side his terror throws
But when he changes from his first repose

Moves but one step , most awfully sedate
Or idly roving , or intent on fate

These are the sev'ral and establish 'd laws
Now see how each maintains his bloody cause

Here paused the god , but ( since whene'er they wage
War here on earth the gods themselves engage

In mutual battle as they hate or love
And the most stubborn war is oft above

Almighty Jove commands the circling train
Of gods from fav'ring either to abstain

And let the fight be silently surveyed
And added solemn threats if disobeyed

Then call 'd he Phoebus from among the Powers
And subtle Hermes , whom in softer hours

Fair Maia bore : youth wanton 'd in their face
Both in life 's bloom , both shone with equal grace

Hermes as yet had never wing 'd his feet
As yet Apollo in his radiant seat

Had never driv'n his chariot through the air
Known by his bow alone and golden hair

These Jove commission 'd to attempt the fray
And rule the sportive military day

Bid them agree which party each maintains
And promised a reward that 's worth their pains

The greater took their seats ; on either hand
Respectful the less gods in order stand

But careful not to interrupt their play
By hinting when t ' advance or run away

Then they examine , who shall first proceed
To try their courage , and their army lead

Chance gave it for the White , that he should go
First with a brave defiance to the foe

Awhile he ponder 'd which of all his train
Should bear his first commission o'er the plain

And then determined to begin the scene
With him that stood before to guard the Queen

He took a double step : with instant care
Does the black Monarch in his turn prepare

The adverse champion , and with stern command
Bid him repel the charge with equal hand

There front to front , the midst of all the field
With furious threats their shining arms they wield

Yet vain the conflict , neither can prevail
While in one path each other they assail

On ev'ry side to their assistance fly
Their fellow soldiers , and with strong supply

Crowd to the battle , but no bloody stain
Tinctures their armour ; sportive in the plain

Mars plays awhile , and in excursion slight
Harmless they sally forth , or wait the fight

But now the swarthy Foot , that first appeared
To front the foe , his pond'rous jav'lin reared

Leftward aslant , and a pale warrior slays
Spurns him aside , and boldly takes his place

Unhappy youth , his danger not to spy
Instant he fell , and triumph 'd but to die

At this the sable King with prudent care
Removed his station from the middle square

And slow retiring to the farthest ground
There safely lurk 'd , with troops entrench 'd around

Then from each quarter to the war advance
The furious Knights , and poise the trembling lance

By turns they rush , by turns the victors yield
Heaps of dead Foot choke up the crimson 'd field

They fall unable to retreat ; around
The clang of arms and iron hoofs resound

But while young Phoebus pleased himself to view
His furious Knight destroy the vulgar crew

Sly Hermes long 'd t ' attempt with secret aim
Some noble act of more exalted fame

For this , he inoffensive pass 'd along
Through ranks of Foot , and midst the trembling throng

Sent his left Horse , that free without confine
Rov 'd o'er the plain , upon some great design

Against the King himself . At length he stood
And having fix 'd his station as he would

Threaten 'd at once with instant fate the King
And th ' Indian beast that guarded the right wing

Apollo sigh 'd , and hast'ning to relieve
The straiten 'd Monarch , griev 'd that he must leave

His martial Elephant expos 'd to fate
And view 'd with pitying eyes his dang'rous state

First in his thoughts however was his care
To save his King , whom to the neighbouring square

On the right hand , he snatch 'd with trembling flight
At this with fury springs the sable Knight

Drew his keen sword , and rising to the blow
Sent the great Indian brute to shades below

O fatal loss ! for none except the Queen
Spreads such a terror through the bloody scene

Thus close besieg 'd trembling he cast his eye
Around the plain , but saw no shelter nigh

No way for flight ; for here the Queen opposed
The Foot in phalanx there the passage closed

At length he fell ; yet not unpleas 'd with fate
Since victim to a Queen 's vindictive hate

With grief and fury burns the whiten 'd host
One of their Tow'rs thus immaturely lost

As when a bull has in contention stern
Lost his right horn , with double vengeance burn

His thoughts for war , with blood he 's cover 'd o'er
And the woods echo to his dismal roar

So look 'd the flaxen host , when angry fate
O'erturn 'd the Indian bulwark of their state

Fired at this great success , with double rage
Apollo hurries on his troops t ' engage

For blood and havoc wild ; and , while he leads
His troops thus careless , loses both his steeds

For if some adverse warriors were o'erthrown
He little thought what dangers threat his own

But slyer Hermes with observant eyes
March 'd slowly cautious , and at distance spies

Often would he , the stately Queen to snare
The slender Foot to front her arms prepare

And to conceal his scheme he sighs and feigns
Such a wrong step would frustrate all his pains

Just then an Archer , from the right-hand view
At the pale Queen his arrow boldly drew

Unseen by Phoebus , who , with studious thought
From the left side a vulgar hero brought

But tender Venus , with a pitying eye
Viewing the sad destruction that was nigh

Wink 'd upon Phoebus ( for the Goddess sat
By chance directly opposite ) ; at that

Roused in an instant , young Apollo threw
His eyes around the field his troops to view

Perceiv 'd the danger , and with sudden fright
Withdrew the Foot that he had sent to fight

But Maia 's son with shouts fill 'd all the coast
The Queen , he cried , the important Queen is lost

Phoebus , howe'er , resolving to maintain
What he had done , bespoke the heavenly train

What mighty harm , in sportive mimic flight
Is it to set a little blunder right

When no preliminary rule debarred
If you henceforward , Mercury , would guard

Against such practice , let us make the law
And whosoe'er shall first to battle draw

Or white , or black , remorseless let him go
At all events , and dare the angry foe

He said , and this opinion pleased around
Jove turn 'd aside , and on his daughter frowned

Unmark 'd by Hermes , who , with strange surprise
Fretted and foam 'd , and roll 'd his ferret eyes

And but with great reluctance could refrain
From dashing at a blow all off the plain

Then he resolved to interweave deceits
To carry on the war by tricks and cheats

Instant he call 'd an Archer from the throng
And bid him like the courser wheel along

Bounding he springs , and threats the pallid Queen
The fraud , however , was by Phoebus seen

He smiled , and , turning to the Gods , he said
Though , Hermes , you are perfect in your trade

And you can trick and cheat to great surprise
These little sleights no more shall blind my eyes

The circle laugh 'd aloud ; and Maia 's son
( As if it had but by mistake been done

Recall 'd his Archer , and with motion due
Bid him advance , the combat to renew

But Phoebus watch 'd him with a jealous eye
Fearing some trick was ever lurking nigh

For he would oft , with sudden sly design
Send forth at once two combatants to join

His warring troops , against the law of arms
Unless the wary foe was ever in alarms

Now the white Archer with his utmost force
Bent the tough bow against the sable Horse

And drove him from the Queen , where he had stood
Hoping to glut his vengeance with her blood

Then the right Elephant with martial pride
Roved here and there , and spread his terrors wide

Glittering in arms from far a courser came
Threaten 'd at once the King and Royal Dame

Thought himself safe when he the post had seized
And with the future spoils his fancy pleased

Fired at the danger a young Archer came
Rush 'd on the foe , and levell 'd sure his aim

( And though a Pawn his sword in vengeance draws
Gladly he 'd lose his life in glory 's cause

The whistling arrow to his bowels flew
And the sharp steel his blood profusely drew

He drops the reins , he totters to the ground
And his life issued murm'ring through the wound

Pierced by the Foot , this Archer bit the plain
The Foot himself was by another slain

Towers , Archers , Knights , meet on the crimson ground
And the field echoes to the martial sound

Their thoughts are heated , and their courage fired
Thick they rush on with double zeal inspired

Generals and Foot , with different colour 'd mien
Confusedly warring in the camps are seen

Now these victorious , lord it o'er the field
Now the foe rallies , the triumphant yield

Just as the tide of battle ebbs or flows
As when the conflict more tempestuous grows

Between the winds , with strong and boisterous sweep
They plough th ' Ionian or Atlantic deep

By turns prevail the mutual blustering roar
And the big waves alternate lash the shore

But in the midst of all the battle raged
The snowy Queen , with troops at once engaged

She fell 'd an Archer as she sought the plain
As she retired an Elephant was slain

To right and left her fatal spears she sent
Burst through the ranks , and triumph 'd as she went

Through arms and blood she seeks a glorious fate
Pierces the farthest lines , and nobly great

Leads on her army with a gallant show
Breaks the battalions , and cuts through the foe

At length the sable King his fears betrayed
And begg 'd his military consort 's aid

With cheerful speed she flew to his relief
And met in equal arms the female chief

Who first , great Queen , and who at last did bleed
How many Whites lay gasping on the mead

Half dead , and floating in a bloody tide
Foot , Knights , and Archer lie on every side

Who can recount the slaughter of the day
How many leaders threw their lives away

The chequer 'd plain is fill 'd with dying box
Havoc ensues , and with tumultuous shocks

The different colour 'd ranks in blood engage
And Foot and Horse promiscuously rage

With nobler courage and superior might
The dreadful Amazons sustain the fight

Resolved alike to mix in glorious strife
Till to imperious fate they yield their life

Meanwhile each Monarch , in a neighbouring cell
Confined the warriors that in battle fell

There watch 'd the captives with a jealous eye
Lest , slipping out again , to arms they fly

And slyly push 'd 'em forward on the plain
Th ' enliven 'd combatants their arms regain

So the foul hag , in screaming wild alarms
O'er a dead carcase muttering her charms

( And with her frequent and tremendous yell
Forcing great Hecate from out of hell

Shoots in the corpse a new fictitious soul
With instant glare the supple eyeballs roll

Vulcan alone discern 'd the subtle cheat
And wisely scorning such a base deceit

Call 'd out to Phoebus . Grief and rage assail
Phoebus by turns ; detected Mars turns pale

Then awful Jove with sullen eye reproved
Mars , and the captives order 'd to be moved

To their dark caves ; bid each fictitious spear
Be straight recall 'd , and all be as they were

And now both Monarchs with redoubled rage
Led on their Queens , the mutual war to wage

O'er all the field their thirsty spears they send
Then front to front their Monarchs they defend

But lo ! the female White rush 'd in unseen
And slew with fatal haste the swarthy Queen

Yet soon , alas ! resign 'd her royal spoils
Snatch 'd by a shaft from her successful toils

Struck at the sight , both hosts in wild surprise
Pour 'd forth their tears , and fill 'd the air with cries

They wept and sigh 'd , as pass 'd the fun'ral train
As if both armies had at once been slain

And now each troop surrounds its mourning chief
To guard his person , or assuage his grief

One is their common fear ; one stormy blast
Has equally made havoc as it passed

Not all , however , of their youth are slain
Some champions yet the vig'rous war maintain

Three Foot , an Archer , and a stately Tower
For Phoebus still exert their utmost power

Just the same number Mercury can boast
Except the Tower , who lately in his post

Unarm 'd inglorious fell , in peace profound
Pierced by an Archer with a distant wound

But his right Horse retain 'd its mettled pride
The rest were swept away by war 's strong tide

But fretful Hermes , with despairing moan
Griev 'd that so many champions were o'erthrown

Yet reassumes the fight ; and summons round
The little straggling army that he found

All that had 'scaped from fierce Apollo 's rage
Resolved with greater caution to engage

In future strife , by subtle wiles ( if fate
Should give him leave ) to save his sinking state

The sable troops advance with prudence slow
Bent on all hazards to distress the foe

More cheerful Phoebus , with unequal pace
Rallies his arms to lessen his disgrace

But what strange havoc everywhere has been
A straggling champion here and there is seen

Th ' afflicted Kings bewail their consorts dead
And loathe the thoughts of a deserted bed

And though each monarch studies to improve
The tender mem'ry of his former love

Their state requires a second nuptial tie
Hence the pale ruler with a love-sick eye

Surveys th ' attendants of his former wife
And offers one of them a royal life

These , when their martial mistress had been slain
Weak and despairing tried their arms in vain

Willing , howe'er , amidst the Black to go
They thirst for speedy vengeance on the foe

Then he resolves to see who merits best
By strength and courage , the imperial vest

Points out the foe , bids each with bold design
Pierce through the ranks , and reach the deepest line

For none must hope with monarchs to repose
But who can first , through thick surrounding foes

Through arms and wiles , with hazardous essay
Safe to the farthest quarters force their way

Fired at the thought , with sudden , joyful pace
They hurry on ; but first of all the race

Runs the third right-hand warrior for the prize
The glitt'ring crown already charms her eyes

Her dear associates cheerfully give o'er
The nuptial chase ; and swift she flies before

Nor would the sable King her hopes prevent
For he himself was on a Queen intent

Alternate , therefore , through the field they go
Hermes led on , but by a step too slow

His fourth left Pawn : and now th ' advent'rous White
Had march 'd through all , and gain 'd the wish 'd for site

Then the pleased King gives orders to prepare
The crown , the sceptre , and the royal chair

And owns her for his Queen : around exult
The snowy troops , and o'er the Black insult

Hermes burst into tears , -- with fretful roar
Fill 'd the wide air , and his gay vesture tore

The swarthy Foot had only to advance
One single step ; but oh ! malignant chance

A towered Elephant , with fatal aim
Stood ready to destroy her when she came

He keeps a watchful eye upon the whole
Threatens her entrance , and protects the goal

Meanwhile the royal new-created bride
Pleased with her pomp , spread death and terror wide

Like lightning through the sable troops she flies
Clashes her arms , and seems to threat the skies

The sable troops are sunk in wild affright
And wish th ' earth op'ning snatch 'd 'em from her sight

In burst the Queen , with vast impetuous swing
The trembling foes come swarming round the King

So the poor cows , straggling o'er pasture land
When they perceive the prowling wolf at hand

Crowd close together in a circle full
And beg the succour of the lordly bull

They clash their horns , they low with dreadful sound
And the remotest groves re-echo round

But the bold Queen , victorious , from behind
Pierces the foe ; yet chiefly she designed

Against the King himself some fatal aim
And full of war to his pavilion came

Now here she rush 'd , now there ; and had she been
But duly prudent , she had slipp 'd between

With course oblique , into the fourth white square
And the long toil of war had ended there

The King had fallen , and all his sable state
And vanquish 'd Hermes cursed his partial fate

For thence with ease the championess might go
Murder the King , and none could ward the blow

With silence , Hermes , and with panting heart
Perceived the danger , but with subtle art

( Lest he should see the place ) spurs on the foe
Confounds his thoughts , and blames his being slow

For shame ! move on ; would you for ever stay
What sloth is this , what strange perverse delay

How could you e'er my little pausing blame
What ! you would wait till night shall end the game

Phoebus , thus nettled , with imprudence slew
A vulgar Pawn , but lost his nobler view

Young Hermes leap 'd , with sudden joy elate
And then , to save the monarch from his fate

Led on his martial Knight , who stepp 'd between
Pleased that his charge was to oppose the Queen

Then , pondering how the Indian beast to slay
That stopp 'd the Foot from making farther way

From being made a Queen ; with slanting aim
An archer struck him ; down the monster came

And dying shook the earth : while Phoebus tries
Without success the monarch to surprise

The Foot , then uncontroll 'd with instant pride
Seized the last spot , and moved a royal bride

And now with equal strength both war again
And bring their second wives upon the plain

Then , though with equal views each hop 'd and feared
Yet , as if every doubt had disappeared

As if he had the palm , young Hermes flies
Into excess of joy ; with deep disguise

Extols his own Black troops , with frequent spite
And with invective taunts disdains the White

Whom Phoebus thus reproved with quick return
As yet we can not the decision learn

Of this dispute , and do you triumph now
Then your big words and vauntings I 'll allow

When you the battle shall completely gain
At present I shall make your boasting vain

He said , and forward led the daring Queen
Instant the fury of the bloody scene

Rises tumultuous , swift the warriors fly
From either side to conquer or to die

They front the storm of war : around 'em Fear
Terror , and Death , perpetually appear

All meet in arms , and man to man oppose
Each from their camp attempts to drive their foes

Each tries by turns to force the hostile lines
Chance and impatience blast their best designs

The sable Queen spread terror as she went
Through the mid ranks : with more reserved intent

The adverse dame declined the open fray
And to the King in private stole away

Then took the royal guard , and bursting in
With fatal menace close besieged the King

Alarm 'd at this , the swarthy Queen , in haste
From all her havoc and destructive waste

Broke off , and her contempt of death to show
Leap 'd in between the Monarch and the foe

But Phoebus met a worse misfortune here
For Hermes now led forward , void of fear

His furious Horse into the open plain
That onward chafed , and pranced , and pawed amain

Nor ceased from his attempts until he stood
On the long-wished-for spot , from whence he could

Slay King or Queen . O'erwhelm 'd with sudden fears
Apollo saw , and could not keep from tears

Now all seem 'd ready to be overthrown
His strength was wither 'd , ev'ry hope was flown

Hermes , exulting at this great surprise
Shouted for joy , and fill 'd the air with cries

Instant he sent the Queen to shades below
And of her spoils made a triumphant show

But in return , and in his mid career
Fell his brave Knight , beneath the Monarch 's spear

Phoebus , however , did not yet despair
But still fought on with courage and with care

He had but two poor common men to show
And Mars 's favourite with his iv'ry bow

The thoughts of ruin made 'em dare their best
To save their King , so fatally distressed

But the sad hour required not such an aid
And Hermes breathed revenge where'er he strayed

Fierce comes the sable Queen with fatal threat
Surrounds the Monarch in his royal seat

Rushed here and there , nor rested till she slew
The last remainder of the whiten 'd crew

Sole stood the King , the midst of all the plain
Weak and defenceless , his companions slain

As when the ruddy morn ascending high
Has chased the twinkling stars from all the sky

Your star , fair Venus , still retains its light
And , loveliest , goes the latest out of sight

No safety 's left , no gleams of hope remain
Yet did he not as vanquish 'd quit the plain

But tried to shut himself between the foe
Unhurt through swords and spears he hoped to go

For if none threaten 'd his immediate fate
And his next move must ruin all his state

Vain all the bloody carnage of the plain
Neither would triumph then , the laurel neither gain

Therefore through each void space and desert tent
By different moves his various course he bent

The Black King watch 'd him with observant eye
Follow 'd him close , but left him room to fly

Then when he saw him take the farthest line
He sent the Queen his motions to confine

And guard the second rank , that he could go
No farther now than to that distant row

The sable monarch then with cheerful mien
Approach 'd , but always with one space between

But as the King stood o'er against him there
Helpless , forlorn , and sunk in his despair

The martial Queen her lucky moment knew
Seized on the farthest seat with fatal view

Nor left th ' unhappy King a place to flee unto
At length in vengeance her keen sword she draws

Slew him , and ended thus the bloody cause
And all the gods around approved it with applause

The victor could not from his insults keep
But laugh 'd and sneer 'd to see Apollo weep

Jove call 'd him near , and gave him in his hand
The powerful , happy , and mysterious wand

By which the Shades are call 'd to purer day
When penal fire has purged their sins away

By which the guilty are condemn 'd to dwell
In the dark mansions of the deepest hell

By which he gives us sleep , or sleep denies
And closes at the last the dying eyes

Soon after this , the heavenly victor brought
The game on earth , and first th ' Italians taught

Bounteous Fidessa can not be so cruel
As for to make my heart her fancy 's fuel

The reason is that they may dread her sight
Who doth both give and take away their light

O that I had my mistress at that bay
To kiss and clip me till I ran away

Rancour 'twixt two of them so raging rife
That th ' one could stick the other with his knife

Now if the third assaulted chance to be
By a fourth stranger , him set on the three

Them two 'twixt whom afore was deadly strife
Made one to rob the stranger of his life

And yet when I lay siege unto her heart
Beauty and chastity both take her part

Then , for I speak too late , the Judge doth give
His sentence that in prison I shall live

If that the sentence so unhappy be
Then what am I that gave the same to me

She 'll never yield although they ever cry
And therefore we must all together die

Whom in their rage they shall no sooner kill
Than they themselves themselves unjustly spill

Ah , thou must be unkind , and give denial
And I , poor I , must stand unto my trial

Besides , since from one root we both did spring
Why should not I thy fame and beauty sing

Come , sorrows , come ! You are to me assigned
I 'll bear you all , it is Fidessa 's mind

They promise help but when they see her face
They fainting yield , and dare not sue for grace

No man to these can fitly me compare
These live to die , I die to live in care

With that , away she went , and I did wake withal
When ah ! my honey thoughts were turned to gall

But here she is ! See how he runs amain
I fear at night he will not come again

Groaning both day and night doth tear my heart
My heart doth know the cause and triumphs in the smart

But love 'twixt us will prove a faithful page
And she will love my sorrows to assuage

Thus absent presence , present absence maketh
That hearing my poor suit , she it mistaketh

She breaks the glass ; alas , I can not choose
But grieve that I should so my labour lose

If this be love of which you make such store
Sweet , love me less , that you may love me more

This humour doth with mine full well agree
I must Fidessa 's be , or else not be

Yet at thy farewell , play a friendly part
To make amends , fly to Fidessa 's heart

He hath the best part sure that hath her heart
What have I not , if I have but her heart

I die before I drown , O heavy case
It was because I saw my mistress ' face

For whither do I run beside my text
I run to death , for death must be the next

These did through folly perish all and die
And though I know it , even so do I

Yet do I joy in this , even when I fall
That I shall see again and then see all

Richly shalt thou be entombed , since , for thy grave
Fidessa , fair Fidessa , thou shalt have

Earth , take this earth with thee to be enclosed
Life is to me , and I to it , opposed

True sighs , true groans shall echo in the air
And say , Fidessa , though most cruel , is most fair

O that I were all tongue , her praise to shew
Then surely my poor heart were freed from woe

Then was my pain with ease of pain increased
And I ne'er sick until my sickness ceased

How can I hide that is already known
I have been seen and have no face but one

But I must wish , and crave , and seek , and climb
It 's hard if I obtain not grace in time

But after all , my comfort rests in this
That for thy sake my youth decayed is

And yet when I so low do buried lie
Then shall my love ascend unto the sky

Not daring rush into so rare a place
That gives to her , and she to it , a grace

Who thus my Muse from base attempts hath raised
Whom thus my Muse beyond compare hath praised

But ah , the worst and last is yet behind
For of a griffon she doth bear the mind

When men do wish for death , Fates have no force
But they , when men would live , have no remorse

Better in prison ever to remain
Than being out to suffer greater pain

When these shall be , and I not be
Then will Fidessa pity me

She shall be Love , and thou a foolish boy
Whose virtue proves thy power is but a toy

But cruel now , she scorneth what it craveth
Unkind in kindness , murdering while she saveth

But , for the other greedily doth eye it
I pray you tell me , what do I get by it

So soon mine eyes their office are discharging
And I my griefs with greater griefs enlarging

She was unhappy in her cradle breath
That given was to be another 's death

Of shame or death , if thou must one
Make choice of death and both are gone

Fidessa , seeing how the world doth go
Joineth with fortune in my overthrow

My conquest is -- which shall the conquest gain
Fidessa , author both of joy and pain

One comfort yet the heavens have assigned me
That I must die and leave my griefs behind me

For he that views the glasses of my smart
Must need report she hath a flinty heart

Yet am I still the same but made another
Then not the same ; alas , I am no other

I am not then ashamed to be included
'Mongst those that love , and be with love deluded

I took her to be beauty 's queen alone
But now I see she is a senseless stone

All men do these affirm , and so must I
Unless Fidessa give to me the lie

With these she wounds , she heals , gives life and death
More power hath none that lives by mortal breath

True , that all this with pain enough I prove
And yet most true , I will Fidessa love

And for I am the subject of her ire
All men shall know thereby my love entire

O let me sigh , weep , wail , and cry no more
Or let me sigh , weep , wail , cry more and more

Yea , let me sigh , weep , wail , cry evermore
For she doth pity my complaints no more

Than cruel pagan or the savage Moor
But still doth add unto my torments more

Which grievous are to me by so much more
As she inflicts them and doth wish them more

O let thy mercy , merciless , be never more
So shall sweet death to me be welcome , more

Than is to hungry beasts the grassy moor
As she that to affliction adds yet more

Becomes more cruel by still adding more
Weary am I to speak of this word `` more

Meantime let others praise her constancy
And me attend upon her clemency

Most true that I must fair Fidessa love
Most true that fair Fidessa can not love

Most true that I do feel the pains of love
Most true that I am captive unto love

Most true that I deluded am with love
Most true that I do find the sleights of love

Most true that nothing can procure her love
Most true that I must perish in my love

Most true that she contemns the god of love
Most true that he is snared with her love

Most true that she would have me cease to love
Most true that she herself alone is love

Most true that though she hated , I would love
Most true that dearest life shall end with love

Loveliest of trees , the cherry now
Is hung with bloom along the bough

And stands about the woodland ride
Wearing white for Eastertide

Now , of my threescore years and ten
Twenty will not come again

And take from seventy springs a score
It only leaves me fifty more

And since to look at things in bloom
Fifty springs are little room

About the woodlands I will go
To see the cherry hung with snow

Against the morning beam
I strode beside my team

The tramping team beside
And fluted and replied

Yet down at last he lies
And then the man is wise

And threw it with a will
Then the bird was still

Along the dewy lane
It Sang the song again

Will lead one home to rest
And that will be the best

The sun at noon to higher air
Unharnessing the silver Pair

That late before his chariot swam
Rides on the gold wool of the Ram

So braver notes the storm-cock sings
To start the rusted wheel of things

And brutes in field and brutes in pen
Leap that the world goes round again

The boys are up the woods with day
To fetch the daffodils away

And home at noonday from the hills
They bring no dearth of daffodils

Afield for palms the girls repair
And sure enough the palms are there

And each will find by hedge or pond
Her waving silver-tufted wand

In farm and field through all the shire
The eye beholds the heart 's desire

Ah , let not only mine be vain
For lovers should be loved again

Night should ease a lover 's sorrow
Therefore , since I go to-morrow

And the breast the darnel smothers
Rested once upon another 's

The time you won your town the race
We chaired you through the market-place

Man and boy stood cheering by
And home we brought you shoulder-high

To-day , the road all runners come
Shoulder-high we bring you home

And set you at your threshold down
Townsman of a stiller town

Smart lad , to slip betimes away
From fields where glory does not stay

And early though the laurel grows
It withers quicker than the rose

Eyes the shady night has shut
Can not see the record cut

And silence sounds no worse than cheers
After earth has stopped the ears

Now you will not swell the rout
Of lads that wore their honours out

Runners whom renown outran
And the name died before the man

So set , before its echoes fade
The fleet foot on the sill of shade

And hold to the low lintel up
The still-defended challenge-cup

And round that early-laurelled head
Will flock to gaze the strengthless dead

And find unwithered on its curls
The garland briefer than a girl 's

In steeples far and near
A happy noise to hear

And hear the larks so high
About us in the sky

Good people , come and pray
But here my love would stay

And we will hear the chime
And come to church in time

And stole out unbeknown
And went to church alone

And so to church went she
And would not wait for me

Oh , noisy bells , be dumb
I hear you , I will come

Along the fields as we came by
A year ago , my love and I

The aspen over stile and stone
Was talking to itself alone

`` Oh who are these that kiss and pass
A country lover and his lass

Two lovers looking to be wed
And time shall put them both to bed

But she shall lie with earth above
And he beside another love

And sure enough beneath the tree
There walks another love with me

And overhead the aspen heaves
Its rainy-sounding silver leaves

And I spell nothing in their stir
But now perhaps they speak to her

And plain for her to understand
They talk about a time at hand

When I shall sleep with clover clad
And she beside another lad

High the vanes of Shrewsbury gleam
Islanded in Severn stream

The bridges from the steepled crest
Cross the water east and west

The flag of morn in conqueror 's state
Enters at the English gate

The vanquished eve , as night prevails
Bleeds upon the road to Wales

Ages since the vanquished bled
Round my mother 's marriage-bed

There the ravens feasted far
About the open house of war

When Severn down to Buildwas ran
Coloured with the death of man

Couched upon her brother 's grave
The Saxon got me on the slave

The sound of fight is silent long
That began the ancient wrong

Long the voice of tears is still
That wept of old the endless ill

In my heart it has not died
The war that sleeps on Severn side

They cease not fighting , east and west
On the marches of my breast

Here the truceless armies yet
Trample , rolled in blood and sweat

They kill and kill and never die
And I think that each is I

None will part us , none undo
The knot that makes one flesh of two

Sick with hatred , sick with pain
Strangling-When shall we be slain

When shall I be dead and rid
Of the wrong my father did

How long , how long , till spade and hearse
Put to sleep my mother 's curse

About the hollow ground
The primroses are found

That has not long to stay
And dies on Easter day

With every wind at will
But not the daffodil

The daffodil away
That dies on Easter day

Others , I am not the first
Have willed more mischief than they durst

If in the breathless night I too
Shiver now , 't is nothing new

More than I , if truth were told
Have stood and sweated hot and cold

And through their reins in ice and fire
Fear contended with desire

Agued once like me were they
But I like them shall win my way

Lastly to the bed of mould
Where there 's neither heat nor cold

But from my grave across my brow
Plays no wind of healing now

And fire and ice within me fight
Beneath the suffocating night

_ `` Oh , sick I am to see you , will you never let me be
You may be good for something , but you are not good for me

Oh , go where you are wanted , for you are not wanted here
And that was all the farewell when I parted from my dear

`` I will go where I am wanted , to a lady born and bred
Who will dress me free for nothing in a uniform of red

She will not be sick to see me if I only keep it clean
I will go where I am wanted for a soldier of the Queen

`` I will go where I am wanted , for the sergeant does not mind
He may be sick to see me but he treats me very kind

He gives me beer and breakfast and a ribbon for my cap
And I never knew a sweetheart spend her money on a chap

`` I will go where I am wanted , where there 's room for one or two
And the men are none too many for the work there is to do

Where the standing line wears thinner and the dropping dead lie thick
And the enemies of England they shall see me and be sick

As through the wild green hills of Wyre
The train ran , changing sky and shire

And far behind , a fading crest
Low in the forsaken west

Sank the high-reared head of Clee
My hand lay empty on my knee

Aching on my knee it lay
That morning half a shire away

So many an honest fellow 's fist
Had well-nigh wrung it from the wrist

Hand , said I , since now we part
From fields and men we know by heart

From strangers ' faces , strangers ' lands
Hand , you have held true fellows ' hands

Be clean then ; rot before you do
A thing they 'd not believe of you

You and I must keep from shame
In London streets the Shropshire name

On banks of Thames they must not say
Severn breeds worse men than they

And friends abroad must bear in mind
Friends at home they leave behind

Oh , I shall be stiff and cold
When I forget you , hearts of gold

The land where I shall mind you not
Is the land where all 's forgot

And if my foot returns no more
To Teme nor Corve nor Severn shore

Luck , my lads , be with you still
By falling stream and standing hill

By chiming tower and whispering tree
Men that made a man of me

About your work in town and farm
Still you 'll keep my head from harm

Still you 'll help me , hands that gave
A grasp to friend me to the grave

In my own shire , if I was sad
Homely comforters I had

The earth , because my heart was sore
Sorrowed for the son she bore

And standing hills , long to remain
Shared their short-lived comrade 's pain

And bound for the same bourn as I
On every road I wandered by

Trod beside me , close and dear
The beautiful and death-struck year

Whether in the woodland brown
I heard the beechnut rustle down

And saw the purple crocus pale
Flower about the autumn dale

Or littering far the fields of May
Lady-smocks a-bleaching lay

And like a skylit water stood
The bluebells in the azured wood

Yonder , lightening other loads
The seasons range the country roads

But here in London streets I ken
No such helpmates , only men

And these are not in plight to bear
If they would , another 's care

They have enough as 't is : I see
In many an eye that measures me

The mortal sickness of a mind
Too unhappy to be kind

Undone with misery , all they can
Is to hate their fellow man

And till they drop they needs must still
Look at you and wish you ill

When I meet the morning beam
Or lay me down at night to dream

I hear my bones within me say
`` Another night , another day

`` When shall this slough of sense be cast
This dust of thoughts be laid at last

The man of flesh and soul be slain
And the man of bone remain

`` This tongue that talks , these lungs that shout
These thews that hustle us about

This brain that fills the skull with schemes
And its humming hive of dreams

`` These to-day are proud in power
And lord it in their little hour

The immortal bones obey control
Of dying flesh and dying soul

`` 'T is long till eve and morn are gone
Slow the endless night comes on

And late to fulness grows the birth
That shall last as long as earth

`` Wanderers eastward , wanderers west
Know you why you can not rest

'T is that every mother 's son
Travails with a skeleton

`` Lie down in the bed of dust
Bear the fruit that bear you must

Bring the eternal seed to light
And morn is all the same as night

`` Rest you so from trouble sore
Fear the heat o ' the sun no more

Nor the snowing winter wild
Now you labour not with child

`` Empty vessel , garment cast
We that wore you long shall last

-Another night , another day
So my bones within me say

Therefore they shall do my will
To-day while I am master still

And flesh and soul , now both are strong
Shall hale the sullen slaves along

Before this fire of sense decay
This smoke of thought blow clean away

And leave with ancient night alone
The stedfast and enduring bone

Bring , in this timeless grave to throw
No cypress , sombre on the snow

Snap not from the bitter yew
His leaves that live December through

Break no rosemary , bright with rime
And sparkling to the cruel clime

Nor plod the winter land to look
For willows in the icy brook

To cast them leafless round him : bring
No spray that ever buds in spring

But if the Christmas field has kept
Awns the last gleaner overstept

Or shrivelled flax , whose flower is blue
A single season , never two

Or if one haulm whose year is o'er
Shivers on the upland frore

-Oh , bring from hill and stream and plain
Whatever will not flower again

To give him comfort : he and those
Shall bide eternal bedfellows

Where low upon the couch he lies
Whence he never shall arise

`` Here the hangman stops his cart
Now the best of friends must part

Fare you well , for ill fare I
Live , lads , and I will die

`` Oh , at home had I but stayed
'Prenticed to my father 's trade

Had I stuck to plane and adze
I had not been lost , my lads

`` Then I might have built perhaps
Gallows-trees for other chaps

Never dangled on my own
Had I but left ill alone

`` Now , you see , they hang me high
And the people passing by

Stop to shake their fists and curse
So 't is come from ill to worse

`` Here hang I , and right and left
Two poor fellows hang for theft

All the same 's the luck we prove
Though the midmost hangs for love

`` Comrades all , that stand and gaze
Walk henceforth in other ways

See my neck and save your own
Comrades all , leave ill alone

`` Make some day a decent end
Shrewder fellows than your friend

Fare you well , for ill fare I
Live , lads , and I will die

Empty heads and tongues a-talking
Make the rough road easy walking

If young hearts were not so clever
Oh , they would be young for ever

Loitering with a vacant eye
Along the Grecian gallery

And brooding on my heavy ill
I met a statue standing still

Still in marble stone stood he
And stedfastly he looked at me

`` Well met , '' I thought the look would say
`` We both were fashioned far away

We neither knew , when we were young
These Londoners we live among

Still he stood and eyed me hard
An earnest and a grave regard

`` What , lad , drooping with your lot
I too would be where I am not

I too survey that endless line
Of men whose thoughts are not as mine

Years , ere you stood up from rest
On my neck the collar prest

Years , when you lay down your ill
I shall stand and bear it still

Courage , lad , 't is not for long
Stand , quit you like stone , be strong

So I thought his look would say
And light on me my trouble lay

And I slept out in flesh and bone
Manful like the man of stone

`` Far I hear the bugle blow
To call me where I would not go

And the guns begin the song
'Soldier , fly or stay for long

`` Comrade , if to turn and fly
Made a soldier never die

Fly I would , for who would not
'T is sure no pleasure to be shot

`` But since the man that runs away
Lives to die another day

And cowards ' funerals , when they come
Are not wept so well at home

`` Therefore , though the best is bad
Stand and do the best my lad

Stand and fight and see your slain
And take the bullet in your brain

`` Terence , this is stupid stuff
You eat your victuals fast enough

There ca n't be much amiss , 't is clear
To see the rate you drink your beer

But oh , good Lord , the verse you make
It gives a chap the belly-ache

The cow , the old cow , she is dead
It sleeps well , the horned head

We poor lads , 't is our turn now
To hear such tunes as killed the cow

Pretty friendship 't is to rhyme
Your friends to death before their time

Moping melancholy mad
Come , pipe a tune to dance to , lad

Why , if 't is dancing you would be
There 's brisker pipes than poetry

Say , for what were hop-yards meant
Or why was Burton built on Trent

Oh many a peer of England brews
Livelier liquor than the Muse

And malt does more than Milton can
To justify God 's ways to man

Ale , man , ale 's the stuff to drink
For fellows whom it hurts to think

Look into the pewter pot
To see the world as the world 's not

And faith , 't is pleasant till 't is past
The mischief is that 'twill not last

Oh I have been to Ludlow fair
And left my necktie God knows where

And carried half-way home , or near
Pints and quarts of Ludlow beer

Then the world seemed none so bad
And I myself a sterling lad

And down in lovely muck I 've lain
Happy till I woke again

Then I saw the morning sky
Heigho , the tale was all a lie

The world , it was the old world yet
I was I , my things were wet

And nothing now remained to do
But begin the game anew

Therefore , since the world has still
Much good , but much less good than ill

And while the sun and moon endure
Luck 's a chance , but trouble 's sure

I 'd face it as a wise man would
And train for ill and not for good

'T is true the stuff I bring for sale
Is not so brisk a brew as ale

Out of a stem that scored the hand
I wrung it in a weary land

But take it : if the smack is sour
The better for the embittered hour

It should do good to heart and head
When your soul is in my soul 's stead

And I will friend you , if I may
In the dark and cloudy day

There was a king reigned in the East
There , when kings will sit to feast

They get their fill before they think
With poisoned meat and poisoned drink

He gathered all that springs to birth
From the many-venomed earth

First a little , thence to more
He sampled all her killing store

And easy , smiling , seasoned sound
Sate the king when healths went round

They put arsenic in his meat
And stared aghast to watch him eat

They poured strychnine in his cup
And shook to see him drink it up

They shook , they stared as white 's their shirt
Them it was their poison hurt

-I tell the tale that I heard told
Mithridates , he died old

And soon will evening shut
The laurels all are cut

We 'll to the woods no more
Oh we 'll no more , no more

Beyond the moor and mountain crest
-- Comrade , look not on the west

The sun is down and drinks away
From air and land the lees of day

The long cloud and the single pine
Sentinel the ending line

And out beyond it , clear and wan
Reach the gulfs of evening on

The son of woman turns his brow
West from forty counties now

And , as the edge of heaven he eyes
Thinks eternal thoughts , and sighs

Oh wide 's the world , to rest or roam
With change abroad and cheer at home

Fights and furloughs , talk and tale
Company and beef and ale

But if I front the evening sky
Silent on the west look I

And my comrade , stride for stride
Paces silent at my side

Comrade , look not on the west
'Twill have the heart out of your breast

'Twill take your thoughts and sink them far
Leagues beyond the western bar

Oh lad , I fear that yon 's the sea
Where they fished for you and me

And there , from whence we both were ta'en
You and I shall drown again

Send not on your soul before
To dive from that beguiling shore

And let not yet the swimmer leave
His clothes upon the sands of eve

Too fast to yonder strand forlorn
We journey , to the sunken bourn

To flush the fading tinges eyed
By other lads at eventide

Wide is the world , to rest or roam
And early 't is for turning home

Plant your heel on earth and stand
And let 's forget our native land

When you and I are spilt on air
Long we shall be strangers there

Friends of flesh and bone are best
Comrade , look not on the west

They ask , and there is not an answer
Says I , I will 'list for a lancer

To wash and dress and eat and drink
And look at things and talk and think

Let me lie abed and rest
Ten thousand times I 've done my best

The laws of God , the laws of man
He may keep that will and can

Not I : let God and man decree
Laws for themselves and not for me

And if my ways are not as theirs
Let them mind their own affairs

Their deeds I judge and much condemn
Yet when did I make laws for them

Please yourselves , say I , and they
Need only look the other way

But no , they will not ; they must still
Wrest their neighbour to their will

And make me dance as they desire
With jail and gallows and hell-fire

And how am I to face the odds
Of man 's bedevilment and God 's

I , a stranger and afraid
In a world I never made

They will be master , right or wrong
Though both are foolish , both are strong

And since , my soul , we can not fly
To Saturn nor to Mercury

Keep we must , if keep we can
These foreign laws of God and man

To muse if I should be
The son you see

That she had borne the lad
That borne she had

And here 't is only I
Shall hang so high

And noose me in the knot
And I will rot

They had a likely son
And I have none

Since all is done that 's due and right
Let 's home ; and now , my lad , good-night

To-morrow I shall miss you less
And ache of heart and heaviness

Oh soon enough will pine to nought
Remembrance and the faithful thought

And I shall meet good days and mirth
And range the lovely lands of earth

My man , how full of joy and woe
Your mother bore you years ago

He is here , Urania 's son
Hymen come from Helicon

God that glads the lover 's heart
He is here to join and part

So the groomsman quits your side
And the bridegroom seeks the bride

Friend and comrade yield you o'er
To her that hardly loves you more

Now the sun his skyward beam
Has tilted from the Ocean stream

Light the Indies , laggard sun
Happy bridegroom , day is done

And the star from  $ ( C ( + ( Bta 's steep
Calls to bed but not to sleep

Happy bridegroom , Hesper brings
All desired and timely things

All whom morning sends to roam
Hesper loves to lead them home

Home return who him behold
Child to mother , sheep to fold

Bird to nest from wandering wide
Happy bridegroom , seek your bride

Pour it out , the golden cup
Given and guarded , brimming up

Safe through jostling markets borne
And the thicket of the thorn

Folly spurned and danger past
Pour it to the god at last

Now , to smother noise and light
Is stolen abroad the wildering night

And the blotting shades confuse
Path and meadow full of dews

And the high heavens , that all control
Turn in silence round the pole

Catch the starry beams they shed
Prospering the married bed

And breed the land that reared your prime
Sons to stay the rot of time

All is quiet , no alarms
Nothing fear of nightly harms

Safe you sleep on guarded ground
And in silent circle round

The thoughts of friends keep watch and ward
Harnessed angels , hand on sword

Star may plot in heaven with planet
Lightning rive the rock of granite

Marching , fighting , victory past
Stretch your limbs in peace at last

Throb of drum and timbal 's rattle
Call but man alive to battle

Times enough you bled your best
Sleep on now , and take your rest

Clasp your cloak of earth about you
We must man the ditch without you

Duty , friendship , bravery o'er
Sleep away , lad ; wake no more

Onward led the road again
Through the sad uncoloured plain

Under twilight brooding dim
And along the utmost rim

Wall and rampart risen to sight
Cast a shadow not of night

And beyond them seemed to glow
Bonfires lighted long ago

And my dark conductor broke
Silence at my side and spoke

Saying , ` You conjecture well
Yonder is the gate of hell

Ill as yet the eye could see
The eternal masonry

But beneath it on the dark
To and fro there stirred a spark

And again the sombre guide
Knew my question , and replied

` At hell gate the damned in turn
Pace for sentinel and burn

Dully at the leaden sky
Staring , and with idle eye

Measuring the listless plain
I began to think again

Many things I thought of then
Battle , and the loves of men

Cities entered , oceans crossed
Knowledge gained and virtue lost

Cureless folly done and said
And the lovely way that led

To the slimepit and the mire
And the everlasting fire

And against a smoulder dun
And a dawn without a sun

Did the nearing bastion loom
And across the gate of gloom

Still one saw the sentry go
Trim and burning , to and fro

One for women to admire
In his finery of fire

Something , as I watched him pace
Minded me of time and place

Soldiers of another corps
And a sentry known before

Ever darker hell on high
Reared its strength upon the sky

And our footfall on the track
Fetched the daunting echo back

But the soldier pacing still
The insuperable sill

Nursing his tormented pride
Turned his head to neither side

Sunk into himself apart
And the hell-fire of his heart

But against our entering in
From the drawbridge Death and Sun

Rose to render key and sword
To their father and their lord

And the portress foul to see
Lifted up her eyes on me

Smiling , and I made reply
` Met again , my lass , ' said I

Then the sentry turned his head
Looked , and knew me , and was Ned

Once he looked , and halted straight
Set his back against the gate

Caught his musket to his chin
While the hive of hell within

Sent abroad a seething hum
As of towns whose king is come

Leading conquest home from far
And the captives of his war

And the car of triumph waits
And they open wide the gates

But across the entry barred
Straddled the revolted guard

Weaponed and accoutred well
From the arsenals of hell

And beside him , sick and white
Sin to left and Death to right

Turned a countenance of fear
On the flaming mutineer

Over us the darkness bowed
And the anger in the cloud

Clenched the lightning for the stroke
But the traitor musket spoke

And the hollowness of hell
Sounded as its master fell

And the mourning echo rolled
Ruin through his kingdom old

Tyranny and terror flown
Left a pair of friends alone

And beneath the nether sky
All that stirred was he and I

Silent , nothing found to say
We began the backward way

And the ebbing lustre died
From the soldier at my side

As in all his spruce attire
Failed the everlasting fire

Midmost of the homeward track
Once we listened and looked back

But the city , dusk and mute
Slept , and there was no pursuit

And leave the soldiers at their drill
And all about the idle hill

Too full already is the grave
Of fellows that were good and brave

And all the feats I vowed
When I was young and proud

That looked to Wales away
And saw the last of day

And hushed the countryside
But I had youth and pride

And darkness hard at hand
And the eye lost the land

Breathed from beyond the snows
And I had hope of those

That ever can ensue
Must now be worse and few

For summer 's parting sighs
And then the heart replies

If in that Syrian garden , ages slain
You sleep , and know not you are dead in vain

Nor even in dreams behold how dark and bright
Ascends in smoke and fire by day and night

The hate you died to quench and could but fan
Sleep well and see no morning , son of man

But if , the grave rent and the stone rolled by
At the right hand of majesty on high

You sit , and sitting so remember yet
Your tears , your agony and bloody sweat

Your cross and passion and the life you gave
Bow hither out of heaven and see and save

Of cheat and charmer
Came clad in armour

And most believe her
But man 's deceiver

Were light and fleeting
Of lovers ' meeting

And mine were steady
So I was ready

How clear , how lovely bright
How beautiful to sight

How heaven laughs out with glee
Where , like a bird set free

To-day I shall be strong
No more shall yield to wrong

Days lost , I know not how
I shall retrieve them now

Ensanguining the skies
How heavily it dies

Past touch and sight and sound
Not further to be found

Bells in tower at evening toll
And the day forsakes the soul

Soon will evening 's self be gone
And the whispering night come on

Blame not thou the blinded light
Nor the whisper of the night

Though the whispering night were still
Yet the heart would counsel ill

Oh maiden , let your distaff be
And pace the flowery meads with me

Oh follow me where she is flown
Into the leafy woods alone

The mill-stream , now that noises cease
Is all that does not hold its peace

Under the bridge it murmurs by
And here are night and hell and I

Who made the world I can not tell
'T is made , and here I am in hell

My hand , though now my knuckles bleed
I never soiled with such a deed

And so , no doubt , in time gone by
Some have suffered more than I

Who only spend the night alone
And strike my fist upon the stone

To stand up straight and tread the turning mill
To lie flat and known nothing and be still

From the wash the laundress sends
My collars home with ravelled ends

I must fit , now these are frayed
My neck with new ones London-made

Homespun collars , homespun hearts
Wear to rags in foreign parts

Mine at least 's as good as done
And I must get a London one

All 's wrong that ever I 've done or said
And nought to help it in this dull head

Be good to the lad that loves you true
And the soul that was born to die for you

How many sorts they sow
For only one will grow

With flowers before it dies
But twice 'twill not arise

The thronger of the land
The leaf that hurts the hand

About the courts of Kings
And touch it and it stings

And whistles loud the while
And vaults the stile

When I and not my heir
Was young and there

For all the eye could tell
The world went well

It went so ill that I
Designed to die

Are not so evil-starred
As they are hard

And new the minted mould
The thoughts are old

Smooth between sea and land
Is laid the yellow sand

And here through summer days
The seed of Adam plays

Here the child comes to found
His unremaining mound

And the grown lad to score
Two names upon the shore

Here , on the level sand
Between the sea and land

What shall I build or write
Against the fall of night

Tell me of runes to grave
That hold the bursting wave

Or bastions to design
For longer date than mine

Shall it be Troy or Rome
I fence against the foam

Or my own name , to stay
When I depart for aye

Nothing : too near at hand
Planing the figure sand

Effacing clean and fast
Cities not built to last

And charms devised in vain
Pours the confounding main

Good-night ; ensured release
Imperishable peace

While sea abides , and land
And earth 's foundations stand

When earth 's foundations flee
Nor sky nor land nor sea

Content you , let them burn
It is not your concern

Ask me no more , for fear I should reply
Others have held their tongues , and so can I

Morning up the eastern stair
Marches , azuring the air

And the foot of twilight still
Is stolen toward the western sill

Blithe the maids go milking , blithe
Men in hayfields stone the scythe

All the land 's alive around
Except the churchyard 's idle ground

There 's empty acres west and east
But aye 't is God 's that bears the least

This hopeless garden that they sow
With the seeds that never grow

They shall have breath that never were
But he that was shall have it ne'er

The unconceived and unbegot
Shall look on heaven , but he shall not

The heart with many wildfires lit
Ice is not so cold as it

The thirst that rivers could not lay
A little dust has quenched for aye

And in a fathom 's compass lie
Thoughts much wider than the sky

Stay , if you list , O passer by the way
Yet night approaches ; better not to stay

I never sigh , nor flush , nor knit the brow
Nor grieve to think how ill God made me , now

Here , with one balm for many fevers found
Whole of an ancient evil , I sleep sound

A little dust will lay
And take desire away

You will so soon be dead
And death will serve instead

'T is five years since , ` An end , ' said I
` I 'll march no further , time to die

All 's lost ; no worse has heaven to give
Worse has it given , and yet I live

I shall not die to-day , no fear
I shall live yet for many a year

And see worse ills and worse again
And die of age and not of pain

When God would rear from earth aloof
The blue height of the hollow roof

He sought him pillars sure and strong
And ere he found them sought them long

The stark steel splintered from the thrust
The basalt mountain sprang to dust

The blazing pier of diamond flawed
In shards of rainbow all abroad

What found he , that the heavens stand fast
What pillar proven firm at last

Bears up so light that world-seen span
The heart of man , the heart of man

Some can gaze and not be sick
But I could never learn the trick

There 's this to say for blood and breath
They give a man a taste for death

The stars have not dealt me the worst they could do
My pleasures are plenty , my troubles are two

But oh , my two troubles they reave me of rest
The brains in my head and the heart in my breast

Oh grant me the ease that is granted so free
The birthright of multitudes , give it to me

That relish their victuals and rest on their bed
With flint in the bosom and guts in the head

Oh who is that young sinner with the handcuffs on his wrists
And what has he been after that they groan and shake their fists

And wherefore is he wearing such a conscience-stricken air
Oh they 're taking him to prison for the colour of his hair

'T is a shame to human nature , such a head of hair as his
In the good old time 't was hanging for the colour that it is

Though hanging is n't bad enough and flaying would be fair
For the nameless and abominable colour of his hair

Oh a deal of pains he 's taken and a pretty price he 's paid
To hide his poll or dye it of a mentionable shade

But they 've pulled the beggar 's hat off for the world to see and stare
And they 're haling him to justice for the colour of his hair

Now 't is oakum for his fingers and the treadmill for his feet
And the quarry-gang on Portland in the cold and in the heat

And between his spells of labour in the time he has to spare
He can curse the God that made him for the colour of his hair

In battles of no renown
My fellows and I fell down

And over the dead men roar
The battles they lost before

The thunderstruck flagstaffs fall
The earthquake breaches the wall

The far-felled steeples resound
And we lie under the ground

Oh , soldiers , saluted afar
By them that had seen your star

In conquest and freedom and pride
Remember your friends that died

Amid rejoicing and song
Remember , my lads , how long

How deep the innocent trod
The grapes of the anger of God

Though one departs away
But he departs to-day

Pray thee , take care , that tak'st my Book in hand
To read it well : that is , to understand

IT will be look 'd for Book , when some but see
Thy Title , Epigrams , and nam 'd of me

Thou shoul'dshould'st be bold , licentious , full of gall
Wormwood , and sulphur , sharp , and tooth 'd withall

Become a petulant Thing , hurl Ink , and Wit
As Mad-men Stones : not caring whom they hit

Deceive their Malice , who could wish it so
And by thy wiser Temper , let Men know

Thou art not Covetous of least Self-Fame
Made from the hazard of another 's Shame

Much less , with leud , prophane , and beastly Phrase
To catch the Worlds loose Laughter , or vain Gaze

He that departs with his own Honesty
For vulgar Praise , doth it too dearly buy

THou that mak'st Gain thy end , and wisely well
Call'st a Book good , or bad , as it doth sell

Use mine so , too : I give thee leave . But crave
For the lucks sake , it thus much Favour have

To lye upon thy Stall , till it be sought
Not offer 'd , as it made Suit to be bought

Nor have my Title-leaf on Posts , or Walls
Or in Cleft-sticks , advanced to make Calls

For Termers , or some Clerk-like Serving-man
Who scarce can spell th ' hard Names : whose Knight less can

If , without these vile Arts , it will not sell
Send it to Bucklers-bury , there 'twill well

HOW , best of Kings , dost thou a Scepter bear
How , best of Poets , dost thou Laurel wear

But two Things Rare , the Fates had in their store
And gave thee both , to shew they could no more

For such a Poet , while thy days were green
Thou wert , as chief of them are said t'have been

And such a Prince thou art we daily see
As chief of those still promise they will be

Whom should my Muse then fly to , but the best
Of Kings for Grace ; of Poets for my Test

WHen was there Contract better driven by Fate
Or celebrated with more Truth of State

The World the Temple was , the Priest a King
The spoused Pair two Realms , the Sea the Ring

IF all you boast of your great Art be true
Sure , willing Poverty lives most in you

WHere lately harbour 'd many a famous Whore
A purging Bill , now fix 'd upon the Door

Tells you it is a Hot-house : so it ma
And still be a Whore-house . Th'are Synonyma

Rob 'd both of Money , and the Laws relief
The Courtier is become the greater Thief

MAY none , whose scatter 'd Names honour my Book
For strict Degrees , of Rank , or Title look

'T is 'gainst the Manners of an Epigram
And , I a Poet here , no Herald am

THou call'st me Poet , as a term of Shame
But I have my Revenge made , in thy Name

AT Court I met it , in Clothes brave enough
To be a Courtier ; and looks grave enough

To seem a Statesman : as I near it came
It made me a great Face , I ask 'd the Name

A Lord , it cried , buried in Flesh and Blood
And such from whom let no Man hope least good

For I will do none : and as little ill
For I will dare none . Good Lord , walk Dead still

SHift , here in Town , not meanest amongst Squires
That haunt Pickt-hatch , Mersh-Lambeth , and Whitefryers

Keeps himself , with half a Man , and defrays
The Charge of that State , with this Charm , God pays

By that one Spell he Lives , Eats , Drinks , Arrays
Himself : his whole Revenue is , God pays

The quarter Day is come ; the Hostess says
She must have Money : he returns , God pays

The Taylor brings a Suit home ; he it 'ssays
Looks o'er the Bill , likes it : and says , God pays

He steals to Ordinarys ; there he plays
At Dice his borrowed Money : which , God pays

Then takes up fresh Commodities , for Days
Signs to new Bonds , Forfeits : and crys , God pays

That lost , he keeps his Chamber , reads Essays
Takes Physick , tears the Papers : still , God pays

Or else by Water goes , and so to Plays
Calls for his Stool , adorns the Stage : God pays

To every Cause he meets , this Voice he brayes
His only answer is to all , God pays

Not his poor Cocatrice but he betrays
Thus : and for his Letchery , scores , God pays

But see ! th ' old Baud hath serv 'd him in his trim
Lent him a pocky Whore . She hath paid him

WHen Men a dangerous Disease did 'scape
Of old , they gave a Cock to NFsculape

Let me give two ; that doubly am got free
From my Disease 's danger , and from thee

CAmden , most reverend Head , to whom I owe
All that I am in Arts , all that I know

( How nothing 's that ? ) to whom my Countrey owes
The great Renown , and Name wherewith she goes

Than thee the Age sees not that thing more grave
More high , more holy , that she more would crave

What Name , what Skill , what Faith hast thou in Things
What Sight in searching the most antique Springs

What Weight , and what Authority in thy Speech
Man scarce can make that doubt , but thou canst teach

Pardon free truth , and let thy modesty
Which conquers all , be once over-come by thee

Many of thine this better could , than I
But for their Powers , accept my Piety

ALL Men are Worms : But this no Man . In Silk
'T was brought to Court first wrapt , and white as Milk

Where , afterwards , it grew a Butter-fly
Which was a Caterpiller . So 'twill dye

HArdy , thy Brain is valiant , 't is confest
Thou more ; that with it every day , dar'st jest

Thy self into fresh Brawls : when , call 'd upon
Scarce thy Weeks swearing brings thee off , of one

So , in short time , th ' art in arrearage grown
Some hundred Quarrels , yet dost thou fight none

Nor need'st thou : for those few , by Oath releast
Make good what thou dar'st do in all the rest

Keep thy self there , and think thy value right
He that dares damn himself , dares more than fight

And , but a sprig of Bayes given by thee
Shall out-live Garlands , stoln from the chast Tree

TO thee , my way in Epigrams seems new
When both it is the old way , and the true

Thou saist , that can not be : for thou hast seen
Davis , and Weever , and the best have been

And mine come nothing like . I hope so . Yet
As theirs did with thee , mine might credit get

If thou 'ldst but use thy Faith , as thou didst then
When thou wert wont t ' admire , not censure Men

Pr'ythee believe still , and not judge so fast
Thy Faith is all the knowledge that thou hast

LOrd , how is Gam'ster chang 'd ! his Hair close cut
His Neck fenc 'd round with Ruff ! his Eyes half shut

His Cloths two fashions off , and poor ! his Sword
Forbidd ' his Side ! and nothing , but the Word

Quick in his Lips ! who hath this wonder wrought
The late tane bastinado . So I thought

What several ways Men to their calling have
The Bodies stripes , I see , the Soul may save

HEre lies to each her Parents ruth
Mary , the Daughter of their youth

Yet all Heavens gifts , being Heavens due
It makes the Father , less , to rue

At six Months end , she parted hence
With safety of her Innocence

Whose Soul Heavens Queen , ( whose Name she bears
In comfort of her Mothers Tears

Hath plac 'd among her Virgin-train
Where , while that sever 'd doth remain

This Grave partakes the fleshly Birth
Which cover lightly , gentle Earth

DOnne , the delight of Ph â€œ Â© Â« bus , and each Muse
Who , to thy one , all other Brains refuse

Whose every work , of thy most early Wit
Came forth Example , and remains so , yet

Longer a knowing , than most Wits do live
And which no ' affection praise enough can give

To it , thy Language , Letters , Arts , best Life
Which might with half Mankind maintain a Strife

All which I mean to praise , and , yet , I would
But leave , because I can not as I should

THere 's reason good , that you good Laws should make
Mens Manners ne'er were viler , for your sake

WHile Beast instructs his fair , and innocent Wife
In the past Pleasures of his sensual Life

Telling the motions of each Petticoat
And how his Ganimede mov 'd , and how his Goat

And now , her ( hourly ) her own Cucquean makes
In varied Shapes , which for his Lust she takes

What doth he else , but say , leave to be Chast
Just Wife , and , to change me , make Womans hast

TAnThan his Chast Wife , though Beast now know no more
He 'adulters still : his thoughts lye with a Whore

IN place of Scutcheons , that should deck thy Herse
Take better Ornaments , my Tears , and Verse

To Heaven ; his hath : O happy State ! wherein
We , sad for him , may glory , and not sin

DOn Surly , to aspire the Glorious Name
Of a great Man , and to be thought the same

Makes serious use of all great Trade he knows
He speaks to Men with a Rhinocerote 's Nose

Which he thinks great ; and so reads Verses , too
And that is done , as he saw great Men do

H ' has Tympanies of business , in his Face
And , can forget Mens Names , with a great Grace

He will both Argue , and Discourse in Oaths
Both which are great . And laugh at ill made Cloaths

That 's greater , yet : to cry his own up neat
He doth , at Meals , alone his Pheasant eat

Which is main greatness . And , at his still Board
He drinks to no Man : that 's , too , like a Lord

He keeps anothers Wife , which is a spice
Of solemn greatness . And he dares , at Dice

Blaspheme God , greatly . Or some poor Hind beat
That breathes in his Dogs way : and this is great

Nay more , for greatness sake , he will be one
May hear my Epigrams , but like of none

Surly , use other Arts , these only can
Stile thee a most great Fool , but no great Man

TIlter , the most may ' admire thee , though not I
And thou , right guiltless , may'st plead to it , why

For thy late sharp device . I say 't is fit
All Brains , at times of Triumph , should run Wit

For then our Water-Conduits do run Wine
But that 's put in , thou'lt say . Why , so is thine

GUilty , be wise ; and though thou know'st the Crimes
Be thine , I tax , yet do not own my Rhymes

'Twere madness in thee , to betray thy Fame
And Person to the World ; ere I thy Name

BAnck feels no lameness of his knotty Gout
His Mony 's Travail for him , in and out

And though the soundest Legs go every day
He toils to be at Hell , as soon as they

Which shews , where ever Death doth please t'appear
Seas , Serenes , Swords , Shot , Sickness , all are there

I 'LL not offend thee with a vain Tear more
Glad-mention 'd Roe : thou art but gone before

Whither the World must follow . And I , now
Breathe to expect my when , and make my how

Which if most gracious Heaven grant like thine
Who wets my Grave , can be no Friend of mine

HE that fears Death , or mourns it , in the just
Shews of the Resurrection little trust

WHo would not be thy Subject , James , t'obay
A Prince , that Rules by ' example , more than sway

Whose Manners draw , more than thy Powers constrain
And in this short time of thy Happiest Reign

Hast purg 'd thy Realms , as we have now no cause
Left us of fear , but first our Crimes , then Laws

Like Aids 'gainst Treasons who hath found before
And then in them , how could we know God more

First thou Preserved wert , our King to be
And since ; the whole Land was Preserv 'd for thee

MArtial , thou gav'st far nobler Epigrams
To thy Domitian , than I can my James

But in my Royal Subject I pass thee
Thou flattered'st thine , mine can not flatter 'd be

NO Cause , nor Client fat , will Chev'rill leese
But as they come , on both sides he takes Fees

And pleaseth both : For while he melts his Grease
For this : that wins , for whom he holds his Peace

GUilty , because I bad you late be wise
And to conceal your Ulcers , did advise

You laugh when you are touch 'd , and long before
Any Man else , you clap your hands , and roar

GAnd cry good ! good ! This quite perverts my Sense
And lyes so far from Wit , 't is Impudence

I 'll lose my Modesty , and tell your Name

Who says that Giles and Jone at Discord be
Th ' observing Neighbours no such mood can see

Indeed , poor Giles repents he Married ever
But that his Jone doth too . And Giles would never

By his Free-will , be in Jones Company
No more would Jone he should . Giles riseth Early

And having got him out of Doors is Glad
The like is Jone . But turning Home is sad

And so is Jone . Oft-times when Giles doth find
Harsh Fights at home , Giles wisheth he were Blind

All this doth Jone . Or that his long-yearn 'd Life
Were quite out-spun . The like wish hath his Wife

The Children that he keeps , Giles swears are none
Of his begetting . And so swears his Jone

In all Affections she concurreth still

O , could I lose all Father , now . For why
Will Man lament the state he should envy

To have so soon scap 'd Worlds , and Fleshes rage

Ben . Johnson his best Piece of Poetry

For whose sake , henceforth all his Vows be such
As what he loves may never like too much

IS this the Sir , who some waste Wife to win
A Knight-hood bought , to go a Wooing in

'T is Luckless he , that took up one on Band
To pay at 's day of Marriage . By my hand

The Knight-wright 's cheated then : he 'll never pay
Yes , now he wears his Knighthood every day

He says I want the Tongue of Epigrams

For Witty , in his language , is obscene

Play-wright , I loath to have thy Manners known
In my chast Book : profess them in thine own

LEave Cod , Tabacco-like , burnt Gumms to take
Or fumy Clysters , thy moist Lungs to bake

For we , that have our Eyes still in our Ears
Look not upon thy Dangers , but our Fears

COurtling , I rather thou should'st utterly
Dispraise my Work , than Praise it Frostily

When I am Read , thou fain'st a weak Applause
As if thou wert my Friend , but lack'dst a Cause

This but thy Judgment fools : the other way
Would both thy Folly , and thy Spite betray

LOng-gathering Old-end , I did fear thethee wise
When Having pill 'd a Book which no Man buys

Thou wert content the Author 's Name to loose : lose
But when ( in Place ) thou didst the Patrons choose

It was as if thou printed had'st an Oath
To give the World assurance thou wert both

And that , as Puritanes at Baptism do
Thou art the Father , and the Witness too

For , but thy self , where out of Motly 's he
Could save that line to dedicate to thee

CHev'ril , crys out , my Verses Libels are
And threatens the Star-chamber , and the Bar

What are thy Petulant Pleadings , Chev'ril , then
That quit'st the Cause so oft , and rayl'st at Men

HOw I do love thee Beaumont , and thy Muse
That unto me dost such Religion use

How I do fear my self , that am not worth
The least indulgent thought thy Pen drops forth

At once thou mak'st me happy , and unmak'st
And giving largly to me , more thou tak'st

What Fate is mine , that so it self bereaves
What Art is thine , that so thy Friend deceives

When even there , where most thou praisest me
For Writing better , I must envy thee

From Locks of Wooll , or Shreds from the whole Piece

IDeot , last Night , I pray 'd thee but forbear
To read my Verses ; now I must to hear

For offring , with thy Smiles , my Wit to grace
Thy Ignorance still Laughs in the wrong place

And so my sharpness thou no less dis-joynts
Than thou did'st late my Sense , loosing my points

So have I seen at Christmass Sports , one lost
And , hood-wink 'd , for a Man embrace a Post

SPies , you are Lights in State , but of base Stuff
Who , when you'have burnt your selves down to the Snuff

My Countrys Parents I have many known
But Saver of my Country thee alone

THy Praise , or Dispraise is to me alike
One doth not Stroke me , nor the other Strike

FIne Madam Would-be , wherefore should you fear
That Love to make so well , a Child to bear

The World reputes you Barren : but I know
Your 'pothecary , and his Drug says no

Is it the Pain affrights ? that 's soon forgot
Or you Complexions loss ? you have a Pot

That can restore that . Will it hurt your Feature
To make amends yo'are thought a wholesome Creature

What should the cause be ? Oh , you live at Court
And there 's both loss of Time , and loss of Sport

In a great Belly . Write , then on thy Womb
Of the not Born , yet Buried , here 's the Tomb

WHo can consider thy right Course 's run
With what thy Vertue on the Times hath won

And not thy Fortune ; who can clearly see
The Judgment of the King so shine in thee

WAnd that thou seek'st reward of thy each act
Not from the publick voice , but private fact

Who can behold all Envy so declined
By constant suffering of thy equal mind

And can to these be silent , Salisbury
Without his , thine , and all times Injury

Curst be his Muse , that could lye dumb , or hid
To so true worth , though thou thy self forbid

NOt glad , like those that have new Hopes , or Suits
With thy new Place , bring I these early Fruits

Of Love , and what the Golden Age did hold
A Treasure , Art : Condemn 'd in th ' Age of Gold

Nor glad as those , that old dependents be
To see thy Father 's Rites new laid on thee

Nor glad for Fashion . Nor to shew a Fit
Of flattery to thy Titles . Nor of Wit

But I am glad to see that Time Survive
Where Merit is not Sepulcher 'd alive

Where good Mens Virtues them to Honours bring
And not to dangers . When so wise a King

Contends t'have Worth enjoy , from his regard
As her own Conscience , still , the same reward

These ( Noblest Cecil ) labour 'd in my thought
Wherein what wonder see thy Name hath brought

That whil'st I meant but thine to gratulate
I'have Sung the greater Fortunes of our State

AWay , and leave me , thou thing most abhored
That hast betray 'd me to a worthless Lord

Made me commit most fircefierce Idolatry
To a great Image through thy Luxury

Be thy next Masters more unlucky Muse
And , as thou'hast mine , his Hours , and Youth abuse

Get him the Times long grudg , the Courts ill will
And Reconcil 'd , keep him Suspected still

Make him lose all his Friends ; and , which is worse
Almost all ways , to any better course

With me thou leav'st an happier Muse than thee
And which thou brought'st me , welcome Poverty

She shall instruct my After-thoughts to write
Things manly , and not smelling Parasite

But I repent me : Stay . Who e 're is raised
For worth he has not , He is tax 'd , not praised

THat neither Fame , nor Love might wanting be
To greatness , Cary , I sing that , and thee

Whose House , if it no other Honour had
In only thee , might be both great , and glad

Who , to upbraid the Sloth of this our Time
Durst Valour make , almost , but not a Crime

Which Deed I know not , whether were more high
Or , thou more happy , it to Justify

Against thy Fortune : when no Foe , that Day
Could conquer thee , but chance , who did betray

Love thy great loss , which a Renown hath won
* To Live when Broeck not Stands , nor Roor doth Run

Love Honours , which of best Example be
When they cost dearest , and are done most free

Though every Fortitude deserves Applause
It may be much , or little , in the Cause

He 's valiant'st , that dares Fight , and not for Pay
That Vertuous is , when the Reward 's away

SInce Men have left to do praise-worthy Things
Most think all Praises flatteries . But Truth brings

That Sound , and that Authority with her Name
As , to be rais 'd by her , is only Fame

Stand high , then , Howard , high in Eyes of Men
High in thy Blood , thy Place ; but highest then

When , in Mens wishes , so thy Virtues wrought
As all thy Honours were by them first sought

And thou design 'd to be the same thou art
Before thou wert it , in each good Man 's Heart

Which , by no less Confirm 'd , than thy King 's Choice
Proves , that is God 's , which was the Peoples Voice

PLay-wright convict of publick Wrongs to Men
Takes private Beatings , and begins again

Two kinds of Valour he doth shew at Once
Active in 's Brain , and Passive in his Bones

COb , thou nor Souldier , Thief , nor Fencer art
Yet by thy Weapon liv'st ! Th'hast one good Part

WHen Nature bids us leave to Live , 't is late
Then to begin , my Roe . He makes a state

In Life , that can employ it ; and takes hold
On the true Causes , ere they grow too Old

Delay is bad , Doubt worse , Depending worst
Each best Day of our Life escapes us , first

Then , since we ( more than many ) these Truths know
Though Life be short , let us not make it so

TO pluck down mine , Poll sets up new Wits still
Still , 't is his luck to praise me 'gainst his will

IGrieve not , Court-ling , thou art started up
A Chamber-Critick , and doth Dine , and Sup

At Madams Table , where thou mak'st all Wit
Go high , or low , as thou wilt value it

'T is not thy Judgment breeds the Prejudice
Thy Person only , Court-ling is the Vice

WHat is't , fine Grand , makes thee my Friendship fly
Or take an Epigram so fearfully

As't were a Challenge , or a Borrower 's Letter
The World must know your greatness is my Debter

In-primis , Grand , you owe me for a Jest
I lent you , on meer acquaintance , at a Feast

Item , a Tale or two , some Fortnight after
That yet maintains you , and your House in Laughter

Item , the Babylonian Song you Sing
Item , a fair Greek Posy for a Ring

With which a Learned Madam you bely
Item , a Charm surrounding fearfully

Your partie-per-pale Picture , one half drawn
In solemn Cyphers , the other cob-web Lawn

Item , a gulling Imprese for you , at Tilt
Itemcomma omitted your Mistress Anagram , i'your Hilt

Item , your own , sew 'd in your Mistress Smock
Item , an Epitaph on my Lord 's Cock

In most vile Verses , and cost me more pain
Than had I made 'em good , to fit your vain

Forty Things more , dear Grand , which you know true
For which , or pay me quickly , or I 'll pay you

WHil'st thy weigh 'd Judgments , Egerton , I hear
And know thee , then , a Judge , not of one Year

Whil'st I behold thee live with purest Hands
That no Affection in thy Voice commands

That still th'art present to the better Cause
And no less Wise , than Skilful in the Laws

Whil'st thou art certain to thy Words , once gone
As is thy Conscience , which is always one

The Virgin , long since fled from Earth I see
T'our times return 'd , hath made her Heaven in thee

ICannot think there 's that Antipathy
'Twixt Puritans and Players , as some cry

Though Lippe at Pauls , ran from his Text away
T'inveigh 'gainst Plays : what did he then but play

Such when I meant to fain , and wish 'd to see
My Muse bad , Bedford write , and that was she

BE safe , nor fear thy self so good a Fame
That any way , my Book should speak thy Name

For , if thou shame , rank 'd with my Friends , to go
I 'm more asham 'd to have thee thought my Foe

HOrnet , thou hast thy Wife drest for the Stall
To draw thee Custom : but her self gets all

THE ports of Death are Sins ; of Life , good Deeds
Through which , our Merit leads us to our Meeds

How wilful Blind is he then , that should stray
And hath it , in his Powers , to make his way

This World Deaths Region is , the other Lifes
And here , it should be one of our first strifes

So to front Death , as Men might judge us past it
For good Men but see Death , the wicked tast it

FOrbear to tempt me Proule , I will not show
A Line unto thee , till the World it know

Or that I'have by two good sufficient Men
To be the wealthy Witness of my Pen

For all thou hear'st , thou swear'st thy self didst do
Thy Wit lives by it , Proule , and Belly too

Which , if thou leave not soon ( though I am loth
I must a Libel make , and cozen both

SUrly 's Old Whore in her New Silks doth swim
He cast , yet keeps her well ! No , she keeps him

TO put out the word , Whore , thou do'st me woo
Throughout my Book . 'Troth put out Woman too

O Madam , if your grant did thus transfer me
Make it your Gift . See whither that will bear me

GOodyere , I 'm glad , and grateful to report
My self a Witness of thy few days sport

Where I both learn 'd , why wise-men Hawking follow
And why that Bird was sacred to Apollo

She doth instruct men by her gallant flight
That they to Knowledge so should tour upright

And never stoop , but to strike Ignorance
Which if they miss , yet they should re-advance

To former height , and there in Circle tarry
Till they be sure to make the Fool their Quarry

Now , in whose Pleasures I have this discerned
What would his serious Actions me have learned

WHen I would know thee Goodyere , my thought looks
Upon thy well-made choice of Friends , and Books

Then do I love thee , and behold thy ends
In making thy Friends Books , and thy Books Friends

Now , I must give thy life , and deed , the voice
Attending such a study , such a choice

Where , though't be love , that to thy praise doth move
It was a knowledge , that begat that love

TOuch 'd with the Sin of False-play , in his Punck
Hazard a month forswore his ; and grew drunk

Each night , to drown his Cares : But when the gain
Of what she had wrought came in , and wak 'd his brain

Upon th'accompt , hers grew the quicker trade
Since when , he 's sober again , and all play 's made

WOuld you believe , when you this Mounsieur see
That his whole body should speak French , not he

That so much scarf of France , and hat , and feather
And shoe , and tye , and garter , should come hether

And land on one , whose face durst never be
Toward the Sea , farther than half-way Tree

That he , untravell 'd , should be French so much
As French-men in his Company , should seem Dutch

Or had his Father , when he did him get
The French Disease , with which he labours yet

Or hung some Mounsieur 's Picture on the Wall
By which his Dam conceiv 'd him clothes and all

Or is it some French Statue ? No : 'T doth move
And stoop , and cringe . O then , it needs must prove

The new French-Taylor 's motion , monthly made
Daily to turn in Pauls , and help the trade

IF Rome so great , and in her wisest Age
Fear 'd not to boast the Glories of her Stage

As skilful Roscius , and grave NFsop , Men
Yet crown 'd with Honors , as with Riches , then

Who had no less a Trumpet of their Name
Than Cicero , whose every Breath was Fame

How can so great Example dye in me
That Allen , I should pause to publish thee

Who both their Graces in thy self hast more
Out-stript , than they did all that went before

And present worth in all dost so contract
As others speak , but only thou dost act

Wear this renown . 'T is just , that who did give
So many Poets Life , by one should live

WHen Mill first came to Court , the unprofiting Fool
Unworthy such a Mistress , such a School

Was dull , and long , ere she would go to Man
At last , ease , appetite , and example wan

The nicer Thing to taste her Ladies Page
And , finding good security in his Age

Went on : and proving him still , day by day
Discern 'd no difference of his years , or play

Not though that Hair grew brown , which once was amber
And he grown Youth , was call 'd to his Ladies Chamber

Still Mill continu 'd : Nay , his Face growing worse
And he remov 'd to Gent'man of the Horse

Mill was the same . Since , both his Body and Face
Blown up ; and he ( too unwieldy for that Place

Hath got the Steward 's Chair ; he will not tarry
Longer a day , but with his Mill will marry

And it is hop 'd , that she , like Milo , will
First bearing him a Calf , bear him a Bull

WHich of thy Names I take , not only bears
A Roman Sound , but Roman Vertue wears

Illustrious Vere , or Horace ; fit to be
Sung by a Horace , or a Muse as free

Which thou art to thy self : whose Fame was won
In th'eye of Europe , where thy Deeds were done

When on thy Trumpet she did sound a blast
Whose rellish to Eternity shall last

I leave thy Acts , which should I prosecute
Throughout , might Flatt'ry seem ; and to be mute

To any one , were Envy : which would live
Against my Grave , and Time could not forgive

I speak thy other Graces , not less shown
Nor less in practice ; but less mark 'd , less known

Humanity , and Piety , which are
As noble in great Chiefs , as they are rare

And best become the valiant Man to wear
Who more should seek Mens reverence , than fear

ERe Cherries ripe , and Straw-berries be gon
Unto the Crys of London I 'll add one

Ripe Statesmen , ripe : They grow in every Street
At six and twenty , ripe . You shall 'em meet

And have 'em yield no favour , but of State
Ripe are their Ruffs , their Cuffs , their Beards , their Gate

And Grave as ripe , like mellow as their Faces
They know the States of Christendom , not the Places

Yet have they seen the Maps , and bought 'em too
And understand 'em , as most Chapmen do

The Counsels , Projects , Practices they know
And what each Prince doth for Intelligence owe

And unto whom : They are the Almanacks
For Twelve Years yet to come , what each State lacks

They carry in their Pockets Tacitus
And the Gazetti , or Gallo-Belgicus

And talk reserv 'd , lock 'd up , and full of fear
Nay , ask you , how the Day goes in your Ear

Keep a Star-Chamber Sentence close , Twelve Days
And whisper what a Proclamation says

They meet in Sixes , and at every Mart
Are sure to con ' the Catalogue by heart

Or , every Day , some one at Rimee 's looks
Or Bills , and there he buys the Names of Books

They all get Porta , for the sundry ways
To write in Cypher , and the several Keys

To ope ' the Character . They 've found the slight
With Juice of Limons , Onions , Piss , to write

To break up Seals , and close 'em . And they know
If the States make Peace , how it will go

With England . All forbidden Books they get
And of the Powder-Plot , they will talk yet

At naming the French King , their Heads they shake
And at the Pope , and Spain slight Faces make

Or 'gainst the Bishops , for the Brethren , rail
Much like those Brethren ; thinking to prevail

With ignorance on us , as they have done
On them : And therefore do not only shun

Others more modest , but contemn us too
That know not so much State , wrong , as they do

HOw like a Column , Radcliffe , left alone
For the great mark of Virtue , those being gone

Who did , alike with thee , thy House up-bear
Stand'st thou , to shew the Times what you all were

In Ireland . Two bravely in the Battle fell , and dyed
Upbraiding Rebels Arms , and barbarous Pride

And two , that would have faln as great , as they
The Belgick Fever ravished away

Thou , that art all their Valour , all their Spirit
And thine own goodness to increase thy merit

Than whose I do not know a whiter Soul
Nor could I , had I seen all Nature 's Roul

Thou yet remain'st , unhurt , in Peace , or War
Though not unprov 'd : which shews , thy Fortunes are

Willing to expiate the Fault in thee
Wherewith , against thy Blood , they 'Offenders be

LUcy , you brightness of our Sphere , who are
Life of the Muses day , their morning Star

If Works ( not th'Authors ) their own Grace should look
Whose Poems would not wish to be your Book

But these , desir 'd by you , the Maker 's ends
Crown with their own . Rare Poems ask rare Friends

Yet , Satyrs , since the most of Mankind be
Their unavoided subject , fewest see

For none ere took that pleasure in Sins sense
But , when they heard it tax 'd , took more offence

They , then , that living where the Matter is bred
Dare for these Poems , yet , both ask , and read

And like them too ; must needfully , though few
Be of the best : and 'mongst those best are you

Lucy , you brightness of our Sphere , who are
The Muses evening , as their morning-Star

IF , my Religion safe , I durst embrace
That stranger Doctrine of Pythagoras

I should believe , the Soul of Tacitus
In thee , most weighty Savile , liv 'd to us

So hast thou rendred him in all his Bounds
And all his Numbers , both of Sense , and Sounds

But when I read that special Piece , restored
Where Nero falls , and Galba is adored

To thine own proper I ascribe then more
And gratulate the breach , I griev 'd before

Which Fate ( it seems ) caus 'd in the History
Only to boast thy merit in supply

O , would'st thou add like hand , to all the rest
Or , better work ! were thy glad Country blest

To have her Story woven in thy thread
Minerva 's Loom was never richer spread

For who can master those great parts like thee
That liv'st from Hope , from Fear , from Faction free

That hast thy Breast so clear of present Crimes
Thou need'st not shrink at voice of after-times

Whose knowledge claimeth at the Helm to stand
But , wisely , thrusts not forth a forward hand

No more than Salust in the Roman State
As , then , his cause , his glory emulate

Although to write be lesser than to do
It is the next Deed , and a great one too

We need a Man that knows the several graces
Of History , and how to apt their places

Where brevity , where splendor , and where height
Where sweetness is required , and where weight

We need a Man , can speak of the intents
The counsels , actions , orders , and events

Of State , and censure them : we need his Pen
Can write the Things , the Causes , and the Men

But most we need his Faith ( and all have you
That dares not write Things false , nor hide Things true

WHo shall doubt , Donne , where I a Poet be
When I dare send my Epigrams to thee

That so alone canst judge , so ' alone do'st make
And , in thy censures , evenly , do'st take

As free simplicity , to disavow
As thou hast best Authority , t ' allow

Read all I send : and , if I find but one
Mark 'd by thy hand , and with the better Stone

My Title 's seal 'd . Those that for Claps do write
Let Pui'nees , Porters , Players praise delight

And , till they burst , their Backs , like Asses load
A Man should seek great glory , and not broad

SEe you yond ' Motion ? Not the old Fa-ding
Nor Captain Pod , nor yet the Eltham-thing

But one more rare , and in the case so new
His Cloak with orient Velvet quite lin 'd through

His rosie Tyes and Garters so o'reblown
By his each glorious Parcel to be known

He wont was to encounter me , aloud
Where ere he met me ; now he 's dumb , or proud

Know you the cause ? H ' has neither Land , nor Lease
Nor bawdy Stock , that travels for Increase

Nor Office in the Town , nor Place in Court
Nor 'bout the Bears , nor Noise to make Lords sport

He is no Favorites Favorite , no dear trust
Of any Madams , hath neadd 'Squires , 'hath need o ' Squires , ' and must

Nor did the King of Denmark him salute
When he was here . Nor hath he got a sute

Since he was gon , more than the one he wears
Nor are the Queens most honor 'd Maids by th'Ears

About his Form . What then so swells each Limb
Only his Cloths hath over-leaven 'd him

THou hast begun well , Roe , which stand well too
And I know nothing more thou hast to do

He that is round within himself , and streight
Need seek no other strength , no other height

Fortune upon him breaks her self , if ill
And what would hurt his Virtue , makes it still

That thou at once , then nobly mayst defend
With thine own course the judgment of thy Friend

Be always to thy gather 'd self the same
And study Conscience , more than thou would'st Fame

Though both be good , the latter yet is worst
And ever is ill got without the first

THat thou hast kept thy Love , encreast thy Will
Better 'd thy trust to Letters ; that thy Skill

Hast taught thy self worthy thy Pen to tread
And that to write Things worthy to be read

How much of great Example wert thou , Roe
If Time to Facts , as unto Men would owe

But much it now avails , what 's done , of whom
The self-same Deeds , as diversly they come

TFrom Place , or Fortune , are made high , or low
And even the Praisers judgment suffers so

Well , though thy Name less than our great Ones be
Thy Fact is more : let Truth encourage thee

PLay-wright , by chance , hearing some Toys I'had writ
Cry 'd to my Face , they were th'Elixir of Wit

And I must now believe him : for , to Day
Five of my Jests , then stoln , past him a Play

TO Night , grave Sir , both my poor House , and I
Do equally desire your Company

Not that we think us worthy such a Guest
But that your worth will dignifie our Feast

With those that come ; whose Grace may make that seem
Something , which , else , could hope for no esteem

It is the fair Acceptance , Sir , creates
The Entertainment perfect : not the Cates

Yet shall you have , to rectifie your Palate
An Olive , Capers , or some better Sallad

Ush'ring the Mutton ; with a short-leg 'd Hen
If we can get her , full of Eggs , and then

Limons , and Wine for Sauce : to these , a Coney
Is not to be despair 'd of , for our Money

And , though Fowl , now , be scarce , yet there are Clarks
The Sky not falling , think we may have Larks

I 'll tell you of more , and lye , so you will come
Of Partridg , Pheasant , Wood-cock , of which some

May yet be there ; and Godwit if we can
Knat , Rail , and Ruff too . How so ere , my Man

Shall read a Piece of Virgil , Tacitus
Livy , or of some better Book to us

Of which we 'll speak our Minds , amidst our Meat
And I 'll profess no Verses to repeat

To this , if ought appear , which I know not of
That will the Pastry , not my Paper , show of

Digestive Cheese , and Fruit there sure will be
But that , which most doth take my Muse , and me

Is a pure Cup of rich Canary Wine
Which is the Mermaids , now , but shall be mine

Of which had Horace , or Anacreon tasted
Their Lives , as do their Lines , till now had lasted

Tabacco , Nectar , or the Thespian Spring
Are all but Luther 's Beer , to this I sing

Of this we will sup free , but moderately
And we will have no Pooly ' , or Parrot by

Nor shall our Cups make any guilty Men
But , at our parting , we will be , as when

We innocently met . No simple Word
That shall be utter 'd at our mirthful Board

Shall make us sad next Morning : or affright
The Liberty , that we 'll enjoy to Night

IDo but Name thee Pembroke , and I find
It is an Epigram , on all Mankind

Against the bad , but of , and to the good
Both which are ask 'd , to have thee understood

Nor could the Age have mist thee , in this strife
Of Vice , and Virtue ; wherein all great Life

Almost , is exercis 'd : and scarce one knows
To which , yet , of the sides himself he owes

They follow Virtue , for reward , to day
To morrow Vice , if she give better pay

And are so good , or bad , just at a price
As nothing else discerns the Virtue ' or Vice

But thou , whose Nobless keeps one Stature still
And one true Posture , though besieg 'd with ill

Of what Ambition , Faction , Pride can raise
Whose life , ev'n they , that envy it , must praise

That are so reverenc 'd , as thy coming in
But in the view , doth interrupt their Sin

Thou must draw more : and they , that hope to see
The Common-wealth still safe , must study thee

HOw well , fair Crown of your fair Sex , might he
That but the twilight of your Sprite did see

And noted for what Flesh such Souls were framed
Know you to be a Sydney , though unnamed

And being nam 'd , how little doth that Name
Need any Muses Praise to give it Fame

Which is , it self , the Imprese of the great
And glory of them all , but to repeat

Forgive me then , if mine but say you are
A Sydney : but in that extend as far

As lowdest Praisers , who perhaps would find
For every part a Character assigned

My Praise is plain , and where so ere profest
Becomes none more than you , who need it least

WEre they that nam 'd you , Prophets ? Did they see
Even in the dew of Grace , what you would be

Or did our Times require it , to behold
A new Susanna , equal to that old

Or , because some scarce think that Story true
To make those Faithful , did the Fates send you

And to your Scene lent no less dignity
Of Birth , of Match , of Form , of Chastity

Or , more than born for the Comparison
Of former Age , or Glory of our own

Were you advanced , past those Times to be
The light , and mark unto Posterity

Judge they , that can : Here I have rais 'd to show
A Picture , vvhich the World for yours must know

And like it too ; if they look equally
If not , 't is fit for you , some should envy

MAdam , had all Antiquity been lost
All History seal 'd up , and Fables crost

That we had left us , nor by Time , nor Place
Least mention of a Nymph , a Muse , a Grace

But even their Names were to be made a-new
Who could not but create them all , from you

He , that but saw you wear the vvheaten Hat
Would call you more than Ceres , if not that

And , drest in Shepherds tyre , who would not say
You were the bright OEnone , Flora , or May

If Dancing , all would cry th ' Idalian Queen
Were leading forth the Graces on the Green

And , armed to the Chase , so bare her bow
Diana'alone , so hit , and hunted so

There 's none so dull , that for your style would ask
That saw you put on Pallas plumed Cask

Or , keeping your due state , that would not cry
There Juno sat , and yet no Peacock by

So are you Natures Index , and restore
I'your self , all Treasure lost of th'Age before

IF Men get Name , for some one Vertue : Then
What Man art thou , that art so many Men

All-virtuous Herbert ! on whose every part
Truth might spend all her Voice , Fame all her Art

Whether thy Learning they would take , or Wit
Or Valour , or thy Judgment seasoning it

Thy standing Upright to thy self , thy Ends
Like straight , thy Piety to God , and Friends

Their latter praise would still the greatest be
And yet , they , all together , less than thee

DO what you come for , Captain , with your News
That 's , sit , and eat : do not my Ears abuse

I oft look on false Coin , to know't from true
Not that I love it , more , than I will you

Tell the gross Dutch those grosser Tales of yours
How great you were with their two Emperours

And yet are with their Princes : Fill them full
Of your Moravian Horse , Venetian Bull

Tell them , what parts you 've tane , whence run away
What States you 've gull 'd , and which yet keeps yo'in pay

Give them your Services , and Embassies
In Ireland , Holland , Sweden ; pompous lies

In Hungary , and Poland , Turky too
What at Ligorn , Rome , Florence you did do

And , in some Year , all these together heaped
For which there must more Sea , and Land be leaped

If but to be believ 'd you have the hap
Then can a Flea at twice skip i'th ' Map

Give your young States-men , ( that first make you drunk
And then lye with you , closer , than a Punk

For news ) your Ville-royes , and Silleries
Ianin 's , your Nuncio 's , and your Tuilleries

Your Arch-Dukes Agents , and your Beringhams
That are your words of credit . Keep your Names

Of Hannow , Shieter-huissen , Popenheim
Hans-spiegle , Rotteinberg , and Boutersheim

For your next Meal ; this you are sure of . Why
Will you part with them , here , unthriftily

Nay , now you puff , tusk , and draw up your Chin
Twirl the poor Chain you run a feasting in

Come , be not angry , you are Hungry ; eat
Do what you come for , Captain , There 's your Meat

STrength of my Country , whilst I bring to view
Such as are miss-call 'd Captains , and wrong you

And your high Names : I do desire , that thence
Be nor put on you , nor you take offence

I swear by your true Friend , my Muse , I love
Your great Profession ; which I once , did prove

And did not shame it with my actions , then
No more , than I dare now do , with my Pen

He that not trusts me , having vow 'd thus much
But 's angry for the Captain , still : is such

WHo now calls on thee , Nevil , is a Muse
That serves nor Fame , nor Titles ; but doth choose

Where Virtue makes them both , and that 's in thee
Where all is fair , beside thy Pedigree

Thou art not one , seek'st miseries with hope
Wrestlest with dignities , or fain'st a scope

Of service to the Publick , when the end
Is private gain , which hath long guilt to Friend

Thou rather striv'st the matter to possess
And elements of honour , than the dress

To make thy lent Life , good against the Fates
And first to know thine own state , then the States

To be the same in root , thou art in height
And that thy Soul should give thy Flesh her weight

Go on , and doubt not , what Posterity
Now I have sung the thus , shall judg of thee

Thy Deeds , unto thy Name , will prove new Wombs
Whil'st others toil for Titles to their Tombs

NOt CNfsar 's Deeds , nor all his Honours won
In these West-parts , nor when that War was done

The Name of Pompey for an Enemy
Cato 's to boot , Rome , and her Liberty

All yielding to his Fortune , nor , the while
To have engrav 'd these Acts , with his own stile

And that so strong and deep , as't might be thought
He wrote , with the same Spirit that he fought

Nor that his work liv 'd in the hands of Foes
Unargued then , and yet hath Fame from those

Not all these , Edmonds , or what else put too
Can so speak CNfsar , as thy Labours do

For , where his Person liv 'd scarce one just Age
And that , midst Envy , and Parts ; then fell by rage

His Deeds too dying , but in Books ( whose Good
How few have read ! how fewer understood

Thy learned Hand , and true Promethean Art
( As by a new Creation ) part by part

In every Counsel , Stratagem , Design
Action , or Engine , worth a Note of thine

T'all future time , not only doth restore
His life , but makes , that he can dye no more

WHo Edmonds , reads thy Book , and doth not see
What th'antick Soldiers were , the modern be

Wherein thou shew'st , how much the latter are
Beholding to this Master of the War

And that , in action , there is nothing new
More , than to vary what our Elders knew

Which all , but ignorant Captains , will confess
Nor to give CNfsar this , makes ours the less

Yet thou , perhaps , shalt meet some Tongues will grutch
That to the World thou should'st reveal so much

And thence , deprave thee , and thy Work . To those
CNfsar stands up , as from his Urn late rose

By thy great help : and doth proclaim by me
They murther him again , that envy thee

WIth thy small Stock , why art thou vent'ring still
At this so subtle Sport : and play'st so ill

Think'st thou it is meer Fortune , that can win
Or thy rank setting ? that thou dar'st put in

Thy all , at all : and what so ere I do
Art still at that , and think'st to blow me ' up too

I can not for the Stage a Drama lay
Tragick , or Comick ; but thou writ'st the Play

I leave thee there , and giving way , intend
An Epick Poem ; thou hast the same end

I modestly quit that , and think to write
Next morn , an Ode : Thou mak'st a Song e 're Night

I pass to Elegies ; Thou meet'st me there
To Satyrs ; and thou dost pursue me . Where

Where shall I 'scape thee ? in an Epigram
O , ( thou cry'st out ) that is thy proper Game

Troth , if it be , I pity thy ill luck
That both for wit , and sense , so oft dost pluck

And never are encounter 'd , I confess
Nor scarce dost colour for it , which is less

Pr ' y thee , yet save thy rest ; give o 're in time
There 's no vexation , that can make thee prime

SO Ph â€œ Â© Â« bus make me worthy of his Bays
As but to speak thee , Overbury , is praise

So , where thou liv'st , thou mak'st life understood
Where , what makes others great , doth keep thee good

I think , the Fate of Court thy coming craved
That the Wit there , and Manners might be saved

For since , what Ignorance , what Pride is fled
And Letters , and Humanity in the stead

Repent thee not of thy fair Precedent
Could make such Men , and such a Place repent

Nor may ' any fear , to lose of their Degree
Who'in such ambition can but follow thee

IMust believe some Miracles still be
When Sydney 's Name I hear , or Face I see

For Cupid , who ( at first ) took vain delight
In meer Out-forms , until he lost his Sight

Hath chang 'd his Soul , and made his Object you
Where finding so much Beauty met with Virtue

He hath not only gain 'd himself his Eyes
But , in your love , made all his Servants wise

YOu wonder , who this is ! and , why I name
Him not , aloud , that boasts so good a Fame

Naming so many , too ! But , this is one
Suffers no Name , but a Description

Being no vitious Person , but the Vice
About the Town ; and known too , at that price

A subtle Thing , that doth Affections win
By speaking well o'th ' Company it 's in

Talks loud , and bawdy , has a gather 'd deal
Of News , and Noise , to sow out a long Meal

Can come from Tripoly , leap Stools , and Wink
Do all , that 'longs to the Anarchy of Drink

Except the Duel . Can sing Songs , and Catches
Give every one his Dose of Mirth : and watches

Whose Name 's unwelcome to the present ear
And him it lays on ; if he be not there

Tells of him , all the Tales , it self then makes
But , if it shall be question 'd , undertakes

It will deny all ; and forswear it too
Not that it fears , but will have to do

With such a one . And therein keeps it 's Word
'Twill see it 's Sister naked , ere a Sword

At every Meal , where it doth Dine , or Sup
The Cloth 's no sooner gon , but it gets up

And shifting of it 's Faces , doth play more
Parts than th'Italian could do , with his Dore

Acts old Iniquity , and in the fit
Of miming , gets th'Opinion of a Wit

Executes Men in Picture . By defect
From friendship , is its own Fames architect

An Ingineer , in Slanders , of all Fashions
That seeming Praises , are yet Accusations

Describ 'd it 's thus : Defin 'd would you it have
Then , The Towns honest Man 's her errant'st Knave

JEphson , thou Man of Men , to whose lov 'd Name
All Gentry , yet , owe part of their best Flame

So did thy Virtue 'inform , thy Wit sustain
That Age , when thou stood'st up the Master-brain

Thou wert the first , mad'st Merit know her strength
And those that lack 'd it , to suspect at length

'T was not entayl 'd on Title . That some Word
Might be found out as good , and not my Lord

That Nature no such difference had imprest
In Men , but every bravest was the best

That Bloud not Minds , but Minds did Bloud adorn
And to live great , was better , than great born

These were thy knowing Arts : which who doth now
Vertuously practise , must at least allow

Them in , if not , from thee ; or must commit
A desperate Sol â€œ Â© Â« cism in Truth and Wit

GRoyne , come of Age , his State sold out of hand
For 'his Whore : Groyne doth still occupy his land

Thus , in his Belly , can he change a Sin
Lust it comes out , that Gluttony went in

NOt he that flies the Court for want of Cloths
At Hunting rails , having no gift in Oaths

Cries out 'gainst , Cocking since he can not bet
Shuns Press for two main Causes , Pox , and Debt

With me can merit more , than that good Man
Whose Dice not doing well , to ' a Pulpit ran

No , Shelton , give me thee , canst want all these
But dost it out of Judgment , not Disease

Dar'st breath in any Air ; and with safe Skill
Till thou canst find the best , choose the least ill

That to the Vulgar can'st thy self apply
Treading a better path , not contrary

And , in their Errors maze , thine own way know
Which is to live to conscience , not to show

He , that , but living half his Age , dyes such
Makes the whole longer , than 't was given him , much

RUdyerd , as lesser Dames to great ones use
My lighter comes , to kiss thy learned Muse

Whose better Studies while she emulates
She learns to know long difference of their states

Yet is the Office not to be despised
If only Love should make the Action prized

Nor he , for Friendship , to be thought unfit
That strives , his Manners should proceed his Wit

IF I would wish , for Truth , and not for Show
The aged Saturn 's Age , and Rites to know

If I would strive to bring back Times , and try
The World 's pure Gold , and wise Simplicity

If I would Virtue set , as she was young
And hear her speak with one , and her first Tongue

If holiest Friendship , naked to the Touch
I would restore , and keep it ever such

I need no other Arts , but study Thee
Who prov'st , all these were , and again may be

WRiting thy Self , or judging others Writ
I know not which th'hast most , Candor , or Wit

But both th'hast so , as who affects the State
Of the best Writer , and Judge , should emulate

WOuldst thou hear , what Man can say
In a little ? Reader , stay

Underneath this Stone doth lie
As much Beauty , as could die

Which in Life did Harbor give
To more Virtue , than doth live

If , at all , She had a Fault
Leave it buried in this Vault

One Name was Elizabeth
Th'other let it sleep with Death

Fitter , where it dyed , to tell
Than that it liv 'd at all . Farewell

uV'dale , thou Piece of the first Times , a Man
Made for what Nature could , or Virtue can

Both whose Dimensions , lost , the World might find
Restored in thy Body , and thy Mind

Who sees a Soul , in such a Body set
Might love the Treasure for the Cabinet

But I , no Child , no Fool , respect the kind
( The full , the slowingflowing Graces there enshrined

Which ( would the World not miscall't , Flattery
I could adore , almost t'Idolatry

REtir 'd , with purpose your fair Worth to praise
'Mongst Hampton Shades , and Ph â€œ Â© Â« bus Grove of Bayes

I pluck 'd a Branch ; the jealous god did frown
And bad me lay th'usurped Lawrel down

Said I wrong 'd him , and ( which was more ) his Love
I answer 'd , Daphne now no Pain can prove

Ph â€œ Â© Â« bus replied . Bold Head , it is not She
Cary my Love is , Daphne but my Tree

IS there a Hope , that Man would thankful be
If I should fail , in Gratitude , to thee

To whom I am so bound , lov 'd Aubigny
No , I do , therefore , call Posterity

Into the debt ; and reckon on her head
How full of want , how swallow 'd up , how dead

I , and this Muse had been , if thou hadst not
Lent timely Succors , and new Life begot

So , all Reward , or Name , that grows to me
By her attempt , shall still be owing thee

And , than this same , I know no abler way
To thank thy Benefits : which is , to pay

ROE ( and my joy to name ) th'art now , to go
Countries , and Climes , Manners , and Men to know

T ' extract , and choose the best of all these known
And those to turn to blood , and make thine own

May Winds as soft as breath of kissing Friends
Attend thee hence ; and there , may all thy Ends

As the Beginnings here , prove purely sweet
And perfect in a Circle always meet

So , when we , blest with thy Return , shall see
Thy self , with thy first thoughts , brought home by thee

We each to other may this Voice inspire
This is that good NFneas , past through Fire

Through Seas , Storms , Tempests : and imbarqu 'd for Hell
Came back untouch 'd . This Man hath travell 'd well

WHat charming Peals are these
That , while they bind the Senses , do so please

They are the Marriage-rites
Of two , the choicest Pair of Man 's delights

Musique and PoNksie
French Air , and English Verse , here wedded lie

Who did this Knot compose
Again hath brought the Lilly to the Rose

And , with their chained Dance
Recelebrates the joyful Match with France

They are a School to win
The fair French Daughter to learn English in

And , graced with her Song
To make the Language sweet upon her tongue

THat , not a pair of Friends each other see
But the first Question is , When one saw thee

That there 's no Journy set , or thought upon
To Braynford , Hackney , Bow , but thou mak'st one

TThat scarce the Town designeth any Feast
To which thou'rt not a Week , bespoke a Guest

That still thou'rt made the Suppers Flag , the Drum
The very Call , to make all others come

Think'st thou Mime , this is great ? or , that they strive
Whose noise shall keep thy Miming most alive

Whil'st thou dost raise some Player , from the Grave
Out-dance the Babion , or out-boast the Brave

Or ( mounted on a Stool ) thy Face doth hit
On some new Gesture , that 's imputed Wit

O , run not proud of this . Yet , take thy due
Thou dost out-zany Cokely , Pod ; nay , Gue

And thine own Coriat too . But ( would'st thou see
Men love thee not for this : They laugh at thee

TO urge , my lov 'd Alphonso , that bold Fame
Of building Towns , and making wild Beasts tame

Which Musick had ; or speak her known Effects
That she removeth Cares , Sadness ejects

Declineth Anger , persuades Clemency
Doth sweeten Mirth , and heighten Piety

And is t ' a Body , often , ill inclined
No less a sov'raign Cure , than to the Mind

T ' alledge , that greatest Men were not ashamed
Of old , even by her Practice to be famed

To say , indeed , she were the Soul of Heaven
That the eighteighth Sphere , no less , than Planets seven

Mov 'd by her order , and the ninth more high
Including all , were thence call 'd Harmony

I , yet , had utter 'd nothing on thy part
When these were but the praises of the Art

But when I have said , the Proofs of all these be
Shed in thy Songs ; 't is true : but short of thee

WHen we do give , Alphonso , to the Light
A Work of ours , we part with our own Right

For , then , all mouths will judge , and their own way
The Learn 'd have no more Priviledge , than the Lay

And though we could all Men , all Censures hear
We ought not give them taste , we had an Ear

For , if the hum'rous World will take at large
They should be Fools , for me , at their own charge

Say , this , or that Man they to thee prefer
Even those for whom they do this , know they err

And would ( being ask 'd the truth ) ashamed say
They were not to be nam 'd on the same day

Then stand unto thy self , nor seek without
For Fame , with breath soon kindled , soon blown out

IF to admire were to commend , my praise
Might then both thee , thy Work and Merit raise

But , as it is ( the Child of Ignorance
And utter Stranger to all Air of France

How can I speak of thy great pains , but err
Since they can only judge , that can confer

Behold ! the reverend shade of Bartas stands
Before my thought , and ( in thy right ) commands

That to the World I publish , for him , this
Bartas doth wish thy English now were his

So well in that are his Inventions wrought
As his will now be the Translation thought

Thine the Original ; and France shall boast
No more ; those Maiden Glories she hath lost

NO more let Greece her bolder Fables tell
Of Hercules , or Theseus going to Hell

Orpheus , Ulysses : or the Latine Muse
With Tales of Troy 's just Knight , our Faith 's abuse

We have a Shelton , and a Heyden got
Had power to act , what they to fain had not

All , that they boast of Styx , of Acheron
Cocytus , Phlegeton , our have prov 'd in one

The filth , stench , noise : save only what was there
Subtly distinguish 'd , was confused here

Their Wherry had no Sail , too ; ours had none
And in it , two more horrid Knaves , than Charon

Arses were heard to croak , in stead of Frogs
And for one Cerberus , the whole Coast was Dogs

Furies there wanted not : each Scold was ten
And , for the Cryes of Ghosts , Women , and Men

Laden with Plague-sores , and their Sins , were heard
Lash 'd by their Consciences , to die affeard

Then let the former Age , with this content her
She brought the Poets forth , but ours th ' Adventer

Sing the brave Adventure of two Wights
And pity 't is , I can not call 'em Knights

One was ; and he , for Brawn , and Brain , right able
To have been styled of King Arthur 's Table

The other was a Squire , of fair degree
But , in the Action , greater Man than he

Who gave , to take at his Return from Hell
His three for one . Now , Lordlings , listen well

It was the day , what time the powerful Moon
Makes the poor Bankside Creature wet it'Shoon , 'wet its Shoon

In it'own Hall ; 'In its own Hall ; ' when these ( in worthy Scorn
Of those , that put out Monies , on Return

From Venice , Paris , or some Inland passage
Of six times to and fro , without Embassage

Or he that backward went to Berwick , or which
Did dance the famous Morris , unto Norwich

At Breadstreets Mermaid , having din 'd , and merry
Propos 'd to go to Hol'born in a Wherry

A harder task , than either his to Bristo
Or his to Antwerp . Therefore , once more , list ho

A Dock there is , that called is Avernus
Of some Bridewel , and may , in time , concern us

All , that are Readers : But , methinks 't is odd
That all this while I have forgot some god

Or goddess to invoke , to stuff my Verse
And with both Bombard-stile , and Phrase , rehearse

The many perils of this Port , and how
Sans'help of Sybil , or a golden Bough

Or magick Sacrifice , they past along
Alcides , be thou succouring to my Song

Thou'st seen Hell ( some say ) and know'st all Nooks there
Canst tell me best , how every Fury looks there

And art a god , if Fame thee not abuses
Always at hand , to aid the merry Muses

Great Club-fist , tho ' thy Back , and Bones be sore
Still , with thy former Labours ; yet , once more

Act a brave Work , call it thy last Adventry
But hold my Torch , while I describe the entry

To this dire passage . Say thou stop thy Nose
Tis but light pains : Indeed this Dock 's no Rose

In the first Jaws appear 'd that ugly Monster
Ycleped Mud , which , when their Oars did once stir

Belch 'd forth an Air , as hot , as at the Muster
Of all your Night-tubs , when the Carts do cluster

Who shall discharge first his merdurinous Load
Thorow her Womb they make their famous Road

Between two Walls ; where , on one side , to scare Men
Were seen your ugly Centaurs , ye call Carmen

Gorgonian Scolds , and Harpys : on the other
Hung Stench , Diseases , and old Filth , their Mother

With Famine , Wants , and Sorrows many a Dosen
The least of which was to the Plague a Cosen

But they unfrighted pass , tho ' many a Privy
Spake to them louder , than the Ox in Livy

And many a Sink pour 'd out her Rage anenst'em
But still their Valor , and their Virtue fenc't 'em

And , on they went , like Castor brave , and Pollux
Plowing the Main . When , see ( the worst of all Lucks

They met the second Prodigy , would fear a
Man , that had never heard of a ChimNfra

One said , It was bold Briareus , or the Beadle
( Who hath the hundred Hands when he doth meddle

The other thought it Hydra , or the Rock
Made of the Trull , that cut her Father 's Lock

But , coming near , they found it but a Liter
So huge , it seem 'd , they could by no means quit her

Back , cry 'd their Brace of Charons : they cry 'd , No
No going back ; on still you Rogues , and row

How hight the place ? A Voice was heard , Cocytus
Row close then Slaves . Alas , they will beshite us

No matter , Stinkards , row . What croaking Sound
Is this we hear ? Of Frogs ? No , Guts Wind-bound

Over your Heads : Well , row . At this a loud
Crack did report itself , as if a Cloud

Had burst with Storm , and down fell , ab Excelsis
Poor Mercury , crying out on Paracelsus

And all his Followers , that had so abus 'd him
And , in so shitten sort , so long had us 'd him

For ( where he was the god of Eloquence
And subtilty of Metals ) they dispense

His Spirits , now , in Pills , and eke in Potions
Suppositories , Cataplasms , and Lotions

But many Moons there shall not wane ( quoth he
( In the mean time , let 'em imprison me

But I will speak ( and know I shall be heard
Touching this Cause , where they will be affeard

To answer me . And sure , it was th ' intent
Of the grave Fart , late let in Parliament

Had it been seconded , and not in Fume
Vanish 'd away : as you must all presume

Their Mercury did now . By this , the Steme
Of the Hulk touch 'd , and , as by Polypheme

The sly Ulysses stole in a Sheep-skin
The well-greas 'd Wherry now had got between

And bade her Farewell Sough , unto the Lurden
Never did Bottom more betray her Burden

The Meat-boat of Bears-Colledge , Paris-Garden
Stunk not so ill ; nor , when she kist , Kate Arden

Yet , one day in the year , for sweet 't is voyc't
And that is when it is the Lord Mayor 's Foist

By this time had they reach 'd the Stygian Pool
By which the Masters swear , when on the Stool

Of Worship , they their nodding Chins do hit
Against their Breasts . Here , sev'ral Ghosts did flit

About the shore , of Farts , but late departed
White , Black , Blue , Green , and in more Forms out-started

Than all those Atomi Ridiculous
Whereof old Democrite , and Hill Nicholas

One said , the other swore , the World consists
These be the cause of those thick frequent Mists

Arising in that place , through which , who goes
Must try th ' unused Valor of a Nose

And that ours did . For , yet , no Nare was tainted
Nor Thumb , nor Finger to the Stop acquainted

But open , and unarm 'd , encounter 'd all
Whether it languishing stuck upon the Wall

Or were precipitated down the Jakes
And , after , swum abroad in ample Flakes

Or , that it lay , heap 'd like an Usurer 's Mass
All was to them the same , they were to pass

And so they did , from Styx , to Acheron
The ever-boiling Flood . Whose Banks upon

Your Fleet-Lane Furies ; and hot Cooks do dwell
That , with Still-scalding Steems , make the place Hell

The Sinks ran Grease , and Hair of meazled Hogs
The Heads , Houghs , Entrails , and the Hydes of Dogs

For , to say truth , what Scullion is so nasty
To put the Skins , and Offal in a Pasty

Cats there lay divers had been flead and rosted
And , after mouldy grown , again were tosted

Then selling not , a Dish was ta'ne to mince 'em
But still , it seem 'd , the rankness did convince 'em

For , here they were thrown in with th ' melted Pewter
Yet drown 'd they not . They had five Lives in future

But 'mongst these Tiberts , who do you think there was
Old Banks the Jugler , our Pythagoras

Grave Tutor to the learned Horse . Both which
Being , beyond Sea , burned for one Witch

Their Spirits transmigrated to a Cat
And , now , above the Pool , a Face right fat

With great grey Eyes , are lifted up , and mewed
Thrice did it spit : thrice div 'd . At last , it viewed

Our brave Heroes with a milder Glare
And in a pitious Tune , began . How dare

Your dainty Nostrils ( in so hot a Season
When every Clerk eats Artichokes and Peason

Laxative Lettuce , and such windy Meat
Tempt such a passage ? when each Privies Seat

Is fill 'd with Buttock ? And the Walls do sweat
Urine , and Plasters ? When the Noise doth beat

Upon your Ears , of Discords so unsweet
And Outcries of the damned in the Fleet

Can not the Plague-Bill keep you back ? Nor Bells
Of loud Sepulchres with their hourly Knels

But you will visit grisly Pluto 's Hall
Behold where Cerberus , rear 'd on the Wall

Of Holborne ( three Sergeants Heads ) looks o 're
And stays but till you come unto the Door

Tempt not his Fury , Pluto is away
And Madame CNfsar , great Proserpina

Is now from home . You lose your Labours quite
Were you Jove 's Sons , or had Alcides Might

They cry 'd out Pusse . He told them he was Banks
That had so often , shew 'd 'em merry Pranks

They laught , at his laugh-worthy Fate . And past
The Tripple-Head without a Sop . At last

Calling for Radamanthus , that dwelt by
A Sope-Boyler ; and NFacus him nigh

Who kept an Alehouse ; with my little Minos
An ancient pur-blind Fletcher , with a high Nose

They took 'em all to witness of their Action
And so went bravely back , without Protraction

In memory of which most liquid Deed
The City since hath rais 'd a Pyramid

And I could wish for their eterniz 'd Sakes
My Muse had plough 'd with his , that sung A-jax

SOme act of Love 's bound to rehearse
I thought to bind him , in my Verse

Which when he felt , Away ( quoth he
Can Poets hope to fetter me

It is enough , they once did get
Mars , and my Mother , in their Net

I wear not these my Wings in vain
With which he fled me : and again

Into my Rhymes could ne 're be got
By any art . Then wonder not

That since , my Numbers are so cold
When Love is fled , and I grow old

THou art not , Penshurst , built to envious show
Of touch , or marble ; nor canst boast a row

Of polish 'd Pillars , or a Roof of Gold
Thou hast no lanthern , whereof Tales are told

Or Stair , or Courts ; but stand'st an ancient Pile
And these grudg 'd at , are reverenc 'd the while

Thou joy'st in better marks , of Soil , of Air
Of Wood , of Water : therein thou art fair

Thou hast thy Walks for health , as well as sport
Thy Mount , to which the Dryads do resort

Where Pan , and Bacchus their high Feasts have made
Beneath the broad Beech , and the Chestnut shade

That taller Tree , which of a Nut was set
At his great Birth , where all the Muses met

There , in the writhed Bark , are cut the Names
Of many a Sylvane , taken with his Flames

And thence the ruddy Satyrs oft provoke
The lighter Fauns , to reach thy Lady 's Oke

Thy Copp 's too , nam 'd of Gamage , thou hast there
That never fails to serve thee season 'd Deer

When thou would'st Feast , or exercise thy Friends
The lower Land , that to the River bends

Thy Sheep , thy Bullocks , Kine , and Calves do feed
The middle Grounds thy Mares , and Horses breed

Each Bank doth yield thee Conies ; and the Topps
Fertile of Wood , Ashore , and Sydney 's Copp 's

To crown thy open Table , doth provide
The purpled Pheasant , with the speckled side

The painted Partridg lyes in every Field
And , for thy Mess , is willing to be killed

And if the high-swoln Medway fail thy Dish
Thou hast thy Ponds , that pay thee tribute Fish

Fat , aged Carps , that run into thy Net
And Pikes , now weary their own Kind to eat

As loth , the second Draught , or Cast to stay
Officiously , at first , themselves betray

Bright Eels , that emulate them , and leap on Land
Before the Fisher , or into his Hand

Then hath thy Orchard Fruit , thy Garden Flowers
Fresh as the Air , and new as are the Hours

The early Cherry , with the later Plum
Fig , Grape , and Quince , each in his time doth come

The blushing Apricot , and woolly Peach
Hang on thy Walls , that every Child may reach

And though thy Walls be of the Country Stone
They 're rear 'd with no Man 's ruin , no Man 's grone

There 's none , that dwell about them , wish them down
But all come in , the Farmer and the Clown

And no one empty-handed , to salute
Thy Lord , and Lady , though they have no Sute

Some bring a Capon , some a rural Cake
Some Nuts , some Apples ; some that think they make

The better Cheeses , bring 'em ; or else send
By their ripe Daughters , whom they would commend

This way to Husbands ; and whose Baskets bear
An Emblem of themselves , in Plum , or Pear

But what can this ( more than express their love
Add to thy free Provisions , far above

The need of such ? whose liberal Board doth flow
With all , that Hospitality doth know

Where comes no Guest , but is allow 'd to eat
Without his fear , and of thy Lord 's own Meat

Where the same Bear , and Bread , and self-same Wine
That is his Lordship 's , shall be also mine

And I not fain to sit ( as some , this day
At great Mens Tables ) and yet dine away

Here no Man tells my Cups ; nor , standing by
A Waiter , doth my Gluttony envy

But gives me what I call for , and lets me eat
He knows , below , he shall find plenty of Meat

Thy Tables hoard not up for the next day
Nor , when I take my Lodging , need I pray

For Fire , or Lights , or Livory : all is there
As if thou , then , wert mine , or I raign 'd here

There 's nothing I can wish , for which I stay
That found King James , when hunting late , this way

With his brave Son , the Prince , they saw thy Fires
Shine bright on every Hearth as the desires

Of thy Penates had been set on Flame
To entertain them ; or the Country came

With all their zeal , to warm their welcom here
What ( great , I will not say , but ) sudden chear

Didst thou , then , make 'em ! and what praise was heaped
On thy good Lady , then ! who therein , reaped

The just Reward of her high Huswifery
To have her Linnen , Plate , and all Things nigh

When she was far : and not a Room , but drest
As if it had expected such a Guest

These , Penshurst , are thy praise , and yet not all
Thy Lady 's noble , fruitful , chast withall

His Children thy great Lord may call his own
A Fortune , in this Age , but rarely known

They are , and have been taught Religion : Thence
Their gentler Spirits have suck 'd Innocence

Each morn , and even , they are taught to pray
With the whole Houshold , and may , every day

Read , in their virtuous Parents noble Parts
The mysteries of Manners , Arms , and Arts

Now , Penshurst , they that will proportion thee
With other Edifices , when they see

Those proud ambitious Heaps , and nothing else
May say , their Lords have built , but thy Lord dwells

HOw blest art thou , canst love the Country , Wroth
Whether by Choice , or Fate , or both

And , though so near the City , and the Court
Art tane with neithers Vice , nor Sport

That at great Times , art no ambitious Guest
Of Sheriffs Dinner , or Mayor 's Feast

Nor com'st to view the better Cloth of State
The richer Hangings , or Crown-plate

Nor throng'st ( when Masquing is ) to have a sight
Of the short Bravery of the Night

To view the Jewels , Stuffs , the Pains , the Wit
There wasted , some not paid for yet

But canst , at home , in thy securer rest
Live , with unbought Provision blest

Free from proud Porches , or their gilded Roofs
'Mongst loughing Heards , and solid Hoofs

Along'st the curled Woods , and painted Meads
Through which a Serpent River leads

To some cool , courteous Shade , which he calls his
And makes Sleep softer than it is

Or , if thou list the Night in watch to break
A-bed canst hear the loud Stag speak

In spring , oft roused for their Master 's Sport
Who , for it , makes thy House his Court

Or with thy Friends ; the heart of all the Year
Divid'st , upon the lesser Deer

In Autumn , at the Partridg mak'st a Flight
And giv'st thy gladder Guests the Sight

And , in the Winter , hunt'st the flying Hare
More for thy Exercise , than Fare

While all , that follow , their glad Ears apply
To the full greatness of the Cry

Or hauking at the River , or the Bush
OtOr shooting at the greedy Thrush

Thou dost with some Delight the Day out-wear
Although the coldest of the Year

The whil'st the several Seasons thou hast seen
Of Flowry Fields , of cop'ces Green

The mowed Meadows , with the fleeced Sheep
And Feasts , that either Shearers keep

The ripened Ears , yet humble in their height
And Furrows laden with their weight

The Apple-harvest , that doth longer last
The Hogs return 'd home fat from mast

The Trees cut out in log ; and those Boughs made
A Fire now , that lend a Shade

Thus Pan , and Sylvane , having had their Rites
Comus , puts in , for new Delights

And fills thy open Hall with mirth , and cheer
As if in Saturns Reign it were

Apollo 's Harp , and Hermes Lyre resound
Nor are the Muses Strangers found

The rout of rural Folk come thronging in
( Their rudeness then is thought no Sin

Thy noblest Spouse affords them welcome Grace
And the great Heroes , of her Race

Sit mixt with loss of State , or Reverence
Freedom doth with Degree dispense

The jolly Wassal walks the often round
And in their Cups , their Cares are drowned

They think not , then , which side the Cause shall leese
Nor how to get the Lawyer Fees

Such , and no other was that Age , of old
Which boasts t'have had the Head of Gold

And such since thou canst make thine own content
Strive , Wroth , to live long innocent

Let others watch in guilty Arms , and stand
The fury of a rash command

Go enter Breaches , meet the Cannons rage
That they may Sleep with Scars in Age

And shew their Feathers shot , and Colours torn
And brag that they were therefore born

Let this Man sweat , and wrangle at the Bar
For every price in every Jar

And change Possessions , oftner with his Breath
Than either Money , War , or Death

Let him , than hardest Sires , more disinherit
And each where boast it as his Merit

To blow up Orphans , Widows , and their States
And think his Power doth equal Fates

Let that go heap a Mass of wretched Wealth
Purchas 'd by Rapine , worse than Stealth

And brooding o 're it sit , with broadest Eyes
Not doing good , scarce when he dyes

Let thousands more go flatter Vice , and win
By being Organs to great Sin

Get Place and Honor , and be glad to keep
The Secrets , that shall break their Sleep

And so they ride in Purple , eat in Plate
Though Poyson , think it a great Fate

But thou , my Wroth , if I can truth apply
Shalt neither that , nor this envy

Thy Peace is made ; and , when Man 's state is well
'T is better , if he there can dwell

God wisheth , none should wrack on a strange Shelf
To him Man 's dearer , than t'himself

And , howsoever we may think Things sweet
He always gives what he knows meet

Which who can use is happy : Such be thou
Thy Mornings and thy Evenings Vow

Be Thanks to him , and earnest Prayer , to find
A body Sound , with sounder Mind

To do thy Country service , thy self right
That neither Want do thee affright

Nor Death ; but when thy latest Sand is spent
Thou may'st think Life , a Thing but lent

COme my Celia , let us prove
While we may , the Sports of Love

Time will not be ours , for ever
He , at length , our good will sever

Spend not then his Gifts in vain
Suns , that set , may rise again

But , if once we lose this Light
'T is , with us , perpetual Night

Why should we defer our Joys
Fame , and Rumor are but Toys

Can not we delude the Eyes
Of a few poor houshold Spies

Or his easier Ears beguil
So removed by our wile

'T is no Sin , Loves Fruit to steal
But the sweet Theft to reveal

To be taken , to be seen
These have Crimes accounted been

KIss me , Sweet : The wary Lover
Can your Favours keep , and cover

When the common courting Jay
All your Bounties will betray

Kiss again : no Creature comes
Kiss , and score up wealthy sums

On my Lips , thus hardly sundred
While you Breathe . First give a hundred

Then a thousand , then another
Hundred , then unto the t'other

Add a thousand , and so more
Till you equal with the Store

All the Grass that Rumney yields
Or the Sands in Chelsey Fields

Or the Drops in silver Thames
Or the Stars , that gild his Streams

In the silent Summer-Nights
When Youths ply their stoln Delights

That the Curious may not know
How to tell 'em as they flow

And the Envious , when they find
What their Number is , be pined

Say , are not Women truly , then
Stil 'd but the Shadows of us Men

Say , are not Women truly , then
Stil 'd but the Shadows of us Men

WHy , Disease , dost thou molest
Ladies ? and of them the best

Do not Men , ynow of Rites
To thy Altars , by their Nights

Spent in Surfeits : and their Days
And Nights too , in worser ways

Take heed , Sickness , what you do
I shall fear , you 'll Surfeit too

Live not we , as , all thy Stalls
Spittles , Pest-house , Hospitals

Scarce will take our present Store
And this Age will build no more

'Pray thee , feed contented , then
Sickness ; only on us Men

Or if it needs thy Lust will taste
Woman-kind ; devour the waste

Livers , round about the Town
But forgive me , with thy Crown

They maintain the truest Trade
And have more Diseases made

What should , yet , thy Pallat please
Daintiness , and softer Ease

Sleeked Lims , and finest Blood
If thy Leanness love such Food

There are those , that , for thy sake
Do enough ; and who would take

Any pains ; yea , think it price
To become thy Sacrifice

That distil their Husband 's Land
In Decoctions ; and are maned

With ten Emp'ricks , in their Chamber
Lying for the Spirit of Amber

That for the Oyl of Talck , dare spend
More than Citizens dare lend

Them , and all their Officers
That to make all Pleasure theirs

Will by Coach , and Water go
Every Stew in Town to know

Dare entail their loves on any
Bald , or blind , or nere so many

And , for thee at common Game
Play away , health , wealth , and fame

These , Disease , will thee deserve
And will , long ere thou should'st starve

On their Bed most prostitute
Move it , as their humblest Sute

In thy Justice to molest
None but them , and leave the rest

ANd must I sing ? what Subject shall I choose
Or whose great Name in Poets Heaven use

Hercules ? alas his Bones are yet sore
With his old earthly Labours . T'exact more

Ph â€œ Â© Â« bus ? No , tend thy Cart still . Envious day
Shall not give out , that I have made thee stay

Nor will I beg of thee , Lord of the Vine
To raise my Spirits with thy conjuring Wine

Pallas , nor thee , I call on , mankind Maid
That , at thy Birth , mad'st the poor Smith affraid

Go , cramp dull Mars , light Venus , when he Snorts
Or , with thy Tribade Trine , invent new Sports

Let the old Boy , your Son , ply his old Task
Turn the stale Prologue to some painted Mask

Hermes , the Cheater , shall not mix with us
Though he would steal his Sisters Pegasus

Nor all the Ladies of the Thespian Lake
( Though they were crusht into one Form ) could make

My Muse up by Commission : No , I bring
My own true Fire . Now my Thought takes wing

Receive it for a fable
If a bird so amiable

That nature 's fairest creature
Prove of his mistress ' feature

Splendor ! O more than mortal
For other forms come short all

Of her illustrious brightness
As far as sin 's from lightness

Her wit as quick and sprightful
As fire , and more delightful

Than the stolen sports of lovers
When night their meeting covers

Judgment , adorn 'd with learning
Doth shine in her discerning

Clear as a naked vestal
Closed in an orb of crystal

Her breath for sweet exceeding
The phoenix ' place of breeding

But mix 'd with sound , transcending
All nature of commending

Alas then whither wade I
In thought to praise this lady

When seeking her renowning
My self am so near drowning

Retire , and say her graces
Are deeper than their faces

Yet she 's not nice to show them
Nor takes she pride to know them

NOt to know Vice at all , and keep true state
Is Virtue , and not Fate

Next , to that Virtue , is to know Vice well
And her black spight expel

Which to effect ( since no Breast is so sure
Or safe , but she 'll procure

Some way of entrance ) we must plant a Guard
Of Thoughts to Watch , and Ward

At th'Eye and Ear ( the Ports unto the Mind
That no strange , or unkind

Object arrive there , but the Heart ( our Spy
Give knowledge instantly

To wakeful Reason , our affections King
Who ( in th'examining

Will quickly taste the Reason , and commit
Close , the close Cause of it

'T is the securest Policy we have
To make our Sense our Slave

But this true Course is not embrac 'd by many
By many ? scarce by any

For either our Affections do rebel
Or else the Sentinel

( That should ring Larum to the Heart ) doth sleep
Or some great Thought doth keep

Back the Intelligence , and falsly Swears
Th'are base , and idle Fears

Whereof the loyal Conscience so complains
Thus by these subtile Trains

Do several Passions invade the Mind
And strike our Reason blind

Of which usurping Rank , some have thought Love
The first ; as prone to move

Most frequent Tumults , Horrors , and Unrests
In our enflamed Breasts

But this doth from the Cloud of Error grow
Which thus we over-blow

The Thing , they here call Love , is blind Desire
Arm 'd with Bow , Shafts , and Fire

Inconstant , like the Sea , of whence 't is born
Rough , swelling , like a Storm

With whom who Sails , rides on the surge of Fear
And Boils , as if he were

In a continual Tempest . Now , true Love
No such Effects doth prove

That is an Essence far more gentle , fine
Pure , perfect , nay divine

It is a golden Chain let down from Heaven
Whose Links are bright , and even

That falls like Sleep on Lovers , and combines
The soft , and sweetest Minds

In equal Knots : This bears no Brands , nor Darts
To murther different Hearts

But , in a calm , and god-like Unity
Preserves Community

O , who is he , that ( in this peace ) enjoys
Th ' Elixir of all Joys

A Form more fresh , than are the Eden Bowers
And lasting , as her Flowers

Richer than Time , and as Time 's Virtue , rare
Sober , as saddest Care

A fixed Thought , an Eye untaught to glance
Who ( blest with such high Chance

Would , at suggestion of a steep desire
Cast himself from the Spire

Of all his Happiness ? But soft : I hear
Some vicious Fool draw near

That cries , we Dream , and swears there 's no such thing
As this chaste Love we sing

Peace Luxury , thou art like one of those
Who , being at Sea , suppose

Because they move , the Continent doth so
No , Vice , we let thee know

Tho ' thy wild thoughts with Sparrows Wings do flie
Turtles can chastly die

And yet ( in this t'express our selves more clear
We do not number here

Such Spirits as are only Continent
Because Lust 's means are spent

Or those , who doubt the Common Mouth of Fame
And for their Place and Name

Can not so safely sin . Their Chastity
Is meer Necessity

Nor mean we those , whom Vows and Conscience
Have fill 'd with Abstinence

Tho ' we acknowledg , who can so abstain
Makes a most blessed Gain

He that for love of Goodness hateth Ill
Is more Crown-worthy still

Than he , which for Sin 's Penalty forbears
His Heart sins , tho ' he fears

But we propose a Person like our Dove
Grac 'd with a Ph â€œ Â© Â« nix love

A Beauty of that clear , and sparkling light
Would make a Day of Night

And turn the blackest Sorrows to bright Joys
Whose od'rous Breath destroys

All taste of bitterness , and makes the Air
As sweet as she is fair

A Body so harmoniously composed
As if Nature disclosed

All her best Symmetry in that one Feature
O , so Divine a Creature

Who could be false to ? chiefly when he knows
How only she bestows

The wealthy treasure of her love on him
Making his Fortunes swim

In the full flood of her admir 'd perfection
What savage , brute affection

Would not be fearful to offend a Dame
Of this excelling Frame

Much more a noble , and right generous mind
( To vertuous moods inclined

That knows the weight of guilt : He will refrain
From thoughts of such a strain

And to his Sense object this Sentence ever
Man may securely sin , but safely never

WHil'st that , for which all Vertue now is sold
And almost every Vice , almighty Gold

That which , to boot with Hell , is thought worth Heaven
And for it , Life , Conscience , yea Souls are given

Toyles , by grave custom , up and down the Court
To every Squire , or Groom , that will report

Well , or ill , only all the following Year
Just to the weight their this days Presents bear

While it makes Huishers serviceable Men
And some one apteth to be trusted then

Though never after ; whiles it gains the Voice
Of some grand Peer , whose Air doth make rejoice

The Fool that gave it ; who will want , and weep
When his proud Patron 's Favours are asleep

While thus it buys great Graee , Grace and hunts poor Fame
Runs between Man , and Man ; 'tween Dame , and Dame

Solders crackt Friendship ; makes Love last a day
Or perhaps less : whil'st Gold bears all this sway

I , that have none ( to send you ) send you Verse
A Present which ( if elder Writs reherse

The truth of Times ) was once of more esteem
Than this , our Guilt , nor golden Age can deem

When Gold was made no Weapon to cut Throats
Or put to flight Astrea , when her Ingots

Were yet unfound , and better plac 'd in earth
Than , here , to give Pride fame , and Peasants birth

But let this Dross carry what price it will
With noble Ignorants , and let them still

Turn , upon scorned Verse , their Quarter-face
With you , I know , my off'ring will find grace

For what a Sin 'gainst your great Father 's Spirit
Were it to think , that you should not inherit

His love unto the Muses , when his skill
Almost you have , or may have , when you will

Wherein wise Nature you a Dowry gave
Worth an Estate , treble to that you have

Beauty , I know , is good , and Blood is more
Riches thought most : But , Madam , think what store

The World hath seen , which all these had in trust
And now lie lost in their forgotten Dust

It is the Muse alone , can raise to Heaven
And , at her strong Arms end , hold up , and even

The Souls , she loves . Those other glorious Notes
Inscrib 'd in touch or marble , or the Cotes

Painted , or carv 'd upon our great Mens Tombs
Or in their Windows ; do but prove the Wombs

That bred them , Graves : when they were born , they dyed
That had no Muse to make their Fame abide

How many equal with the Argive Queen
Have Beauty known , yet none so famous seen

Achilles was not first , that valiant was
Or , in an Army 's head , that lockt in brass

Gave killing strokes . There were brave Men , before
Ajax , or Idomen , or all the store

That Homer brought to Troy ; yet none so live
Because they lack 'd the sacred Pen , could give

Like life unto 'em . Who heav 'd Hercules
Unto the Stars ? or the Tyndarides

Who placed Jasons Argo in the Sky
Or set bright Ariadnes Crown so high

Who made a Lamp of Berenices Hair
Or lifted Cassiopea in her Chair

But only Poets , rapt with Rage divine
And such , or my hopes fail , shall make you shine

You , and that other Star , that purest light
Of all Lucina 's Train ; Lucy the bright

Than which , a nobler Heaven itself knows not
Who , though she have a better Verser got

( Or Poet , in the Court account ) than I
And , who doth me ( though I not him ) envy

Yet , for the timely Favours she hath done
To my less sanguine Muse , wherein she hath won

My grateful Soul , the subject of her powers
I have already us 'd some happy hours

To her remembrance ; which when time shall bring
To curious light , to Notes , I then shall sing

Will prove old Orpheus Act no Tale to be
For I shall move Stocks , Stones , no less than he

Then all , that have but done my Muse least grace
Shall thronging come , and boast the happy place

They hold in my strange Poems , which , as yet
Had not their Form touch 'd by an English Wit

There like a rich , and golden Pyramid
Born up by Statues , shall I rear your Head

Above your under-carved Ornaments
And shew , how , to the Life , my Soul presents

Your Form imprest there : not with tickling Rhymes
Or Common-places , filch 'd , that take these Times

But high , and noble matter , such as flies
From Brains entranc 'd , and fill 'd with Extasies

Moods , which the god-like Sydney oft did prove
And your brave Friend , and mine so well did love

TI S grown almost a danger to speak true
Of any good Mind , now : There are so few

The bad , by number , are so fortifyed
As what they 've lost t'expect , they dare deride

So both the Prais 'd , and Praisers suffer : Yet
For others ill , ought none their good forget

I , therefore , who profess my self in Love
With every Virtue , whereso 're it move

And howsoever ; as I am at Feud
With Sin and Vice , though with a Throne endued

And , in this Name , am given out dangerous
By Arts , and Practice of the Vicious

Such as suspect themselves , and think it fit
For their own cap'tal Crimes , t'indite my Wit

I , that have suffer 'd this ; and , though forsook
Of Fortune , have not alter 'd yet my look

Or so my self abandon 'd , as because
Men are not just , or keep no holy Laws

Of Nature , and Society , I should faint
Or fear to draw true Lines , 'cause others Paint

I , Madam , am become your Praiser . Where
If it may stand with your soft Blush to hear

Your Self but told unto Your Self , and see
In my Character , what your Features be

You will not from the Paper slightly pass
No Lady , but at sometime loves her Glass

And this shall be no false one , but as much
Remov 'd , as you from Need to have it such

Look then , and see your Self . I will not say
Your Beauty ; for you see that every day

And so do many more . All which can call
It perfect , proper , pure , and natural

Not taken up o'th'Doctors , but as well
As I , can say , and see it doth excel

That asks but to be censur 'd by the Eyes
And , in those outward Forms , all Fools are wise

Nor that your Beauty wanted not a Dower
Do I reflect . Some Alderman has power

Or cos'ning Farmer of the Customs so
T'advance his doubtful Issue , and o'reflow

A Princes Fortune : These are gifts of Chance
And raise not Virtue ; they may Vice enhance

My Mirror is more subtil , clear , refined
And takes , and gives the Beauties of the mind

Though it reject not those of Fortune : such
As Blood , and Match . Wherein , how more than much

Are you engaged to your happy Fate
For such a Lot ! that mixt you with a State

Of so great Title , Birth , but Virtue most
Without which , all the rest were sounds , or lost

'T is only that can Time , and Chance defeat
For he , that once is good , is ever great

Wherewith , then Madam , can you better pay
This blessing of your Stars , than by that way

Of Virtue , which you tread ? What if alone
Without Companions ? 'T is safe to have none

In single paths , Dangers with ease are watched
Contagion in the Preasealternate spelling of 'Press ' is soonest catched

This makes , that wisely you decline your Life
Far from the maze of Custom , Error , Strife

And keep an even , and unhalter 'd Gait
Not looking by , or back , ( like those , that wait

Times , and Occasions , to start forth , and seem
Which though the turning World may disesteem

Because that Studies Spectacles , and Shows
And after varied , as fresh Objects goes

Giddy with Change , and therefore can not see
Right , the right way : yet must your comfort be

Your Conscience , and not Wonder , if none asks
For Truth 's Complexion , where they all wear Masks

Let who will follow Fashions , and Attires
Maintain their Liedgers forth , for Foreign Wyres

Melt down their Husbands Land , to pour away
On the close Groom , and Page , on New-years Day

And almost , all Days after , while they live
( They find it both so witty , and safe to give

Let'em on Poulders , Oyls , and Paintings , spend
Till that no Usurer , nor his Bawds dare lend

Them , or their Officers : and no Man know
Whether it be a Face they wear , or no

Let 'em waste Body , and 'State ; and after all
When their own Parasites laugh at their Fall

May they have nothing left , whereof they can
Boast , but how oft they have gone wrong to Man

And call it their brave Sin . For such there be
That do sin only for the Infamy

And never think , how Vice doth every hour
Eat on her Clients , and some one devour

You , Madam , young have learn 'd to shun these Shelves
Whereon the most of Mankind wreck themselves

And , keeping a just Course , have early put
Into your Harbour , and all passage shut

'Gainst Storms , or Pirats , that might charge your Peace
For which you worthy are the glad Increase

Of your blest Womb , made fruitful from above
To pay your Lord the pledges of chaste Love

And raise a noble Stem , to give the Fame
To Clifton 's Blood , that is deny 'd their Name

Grow , grow , fair Tree , and as thy Branches shoot
Hear , what the Muses sing above thy Root

By me , their Priest ( if they can ought Divine
Before the Moons have fill 'd their triple Trine

To crown the Burden which you go withall
It shall a ripe and timely Issue fall

T'expect the Honours of great Aubigny
And greater Rites , yet writ in Mystery

But which the Fates forbid me to reveal
Only , thus much , out of a ravish 'd Zeal

Unto your Name , and goodness of your Life
They speak ; since you are truly that rare Wife

Other great Wives may blush at : when they see
What your try 'd manners are , what theirs should be

How you love one , and him you should ; how still
You are depending on his Word , and Will

Not fashion 'd for the Court , or Stranger 's Eyes
But to preaseplease him , who is the dearer Prize

Unto himself , by being so dear to you
This makes , that your Affections still be new

And that your Souls conspire , as they were gone
Each into other , and had now made one

Live that one , still ; and as long years do pass
Madam , be bold to use this truest Glass

Wherein , your Form , you still the same shall find
Because nor it can change , nor such a Mind

Some Ring
Some Sing

Wherefore should I
Stand silent by

Who not the least
Both love the Cause , and Authors of the Feast

This Day
Doth say

When all the Noise
Of these forc 'd Joys

Are fled and gone
And he , with his best Genius left alone

Your Vow
Must now

Since he doth lack
Of going back

Little , whose Will
Doth urge him to run wrong , or to stand still

Your Blood
So good

Nor weary , rest
On what 's deceas't

For they , that swell
With Dust of Ancestors , in Graves but dwell

'Twill be exacted of your Name , whose Son
Whose Nephew , whose Grandchild you are

And Men
Will , then

Say you have follow 'd far
When well begun

Which must be now
They teach you , how

And he that stays
To live until to Morrow'hath lost two Days

So may
This Day

Of Love be bright
As with the light

Of Bonfires . Then
The Birth-day shines , when Logs not burn , but Men

GOod , and great God , can I not think of thee
But it must , straight , my Melancholy be

Is it interpreted in me Disease
That , laden with my Sins , I seek for Ease

O , be thou Witness , that the Reins dost know
And Hearts of all , if I be sad for Show

And judge me after : if I dare pretend
To ought but Grace , or aim at other End

As thou art All , so be thou All to me
First , midst , and last , converted one , and three

My Faith , my Hope , my Love : and in this state
My Judge , my Witness , and my Advocate

Where have I been this while exil 'd from thee
And whither rapt , now thou but stoup'st to me

Dwell , dwell here still : O , being every-where
How can I doubt to find thee ever , here

I know my state , both full of Shame , and Scorn
Conceiv 'd in Sin , and unto Labour born

Standing with Fear , and must with Horror fall
And destin 'd unto judgment , after all

I feel my Griefs too , and there scarce is Ground
Upon my Flesh t'inflict another Wound

Yet dare I not complain , or wish for Death
With holy Paul , lest it be thought the Breath

Of Discontent ; or that these Prayers be
For weariness of Life , not love of thee

OHoly , blessed , glorious Trinity
Of Persons , still one God , in Unity

. My self up to thee , harrow 'd , torn , and bruised
By sin , and Sathan ; and my flesh misused

. All-gracious God , the Sinners Sacrifice
A broken Heart thou wert not wont despise

. For thy acceptance . O , behold me right
And take compassion on my grievous plight

. Eternal Father , God , who did'st create
This All of nothing , gavest it Form , and Fate

. Eternal God the Son , who not deny'dst
To take our Nature ; becam'st Man , and dy'dst

. Eternal Spirit , God from both proceeding
Father and Son ; the Comforter , in breeding

. Increase those acts , O glorious Trinity
Of Persons , still one God in Unity

. My Maker , Saviour , and my Sanctifier
To hear , to meditate , sweeten my desire

. Among thy Saints elected to abide
And with thy Angels placed , side by side

A broken Heart
Is my best part

That I may prove
Therein , thy Love

Been stern to me
But left me free

As minds ill bent
Rarely repent

Than thou hast done
That gav'st a Son

First made of nought
Withall since bought

His glorious Name
Quite overcame

Before my loss
Me farther toss

ISing the Birth , was born to Night
The Author both of Life , and Light

And like the ravish 'd Shep'erds said
Who saw the Light , and were afraid

The Son of God , th ' Eternal King
That did us all Salvation bring

He whom the whole World could not take
The Word , which Heaven and Earth did make

The Father 's Wisdom will 'd it so
The Sons obedience knew no No

And as that Wisdom had decreed
The Word was now made Flesh indeed

What comfort by him do we win
Who made himself the price of Sin

To see this Babe , all Innocence
A Martyr born in our Defence

LEt it not your wonder move
Less your laughter , that I love

Though I now write fifty Years
I have had , and have my Peers

Poets , though divine , are Men
Some have lov 'd as old agen

And it is not always Face
Clothes , or Fortune gives the grace

Or the Feature , or the Youth
But the Language , and the Truth

With the Ardor , and the Passion
Gives the Lover weight , and fashion

If you then will read the Story
First , prepare you to be sorry

That you never knew till now
Either whom to love , or how

But be glad , as soon with me
When you know that this is she

Of whose Beauty it was sung
She shall make the old Man young

Keep the middle Age at stay
And let nothing high decay

Till she be the reason why
All the World for Love may die

IBeheld her , on a Day
When her look out-flourisht May

And her dressing did out-brave
All the Pride the Fields then have

Far I was from being stupid
For I ran and call 'd on Cupid

Love , if thou wilt ever see
Mark of glory , come with me

Where 's thy Quiver ? bend thy Bow
Here 's a Shaft , thou art too slow

And ( withal ) I did untie
Every Cloud about his Eye

But , he had not gain 'd his sight
Sooner than he lost his Might

Or his Courage ; for away
Strait he ran , and durst not stay

Letting Bow and Arrow fall
Nor for any Threat , or Call

Could be brought once back to look
I fool-hardy , there up took

Both the Arrow he had quit
And the Bow , which thought to hit

This my Object : But she threw
Such a Lightning ( as I drew

At my Face , that took my Sight
And my Motion from me quite

So that there , I stood a Stone
Mock 'd of all ; and call 'd of one

( Which with grief and wrath I heard
Cupid 's Statue with a Beard

Or else one that plaid his Ape
In a Hercules his shape

AFter many scorns like these
Which the prouder Beauties please

She content was to restore
Eyes and Limbs , to hurt me more

And would on Conditions , be
Reconcil 'd to Love , and me

First , that I must kneeling yield
Both the Bow , and shaft I held

Unto her ; which Love might take
At her Hand , with Oath , to make

Me , the scope of his next draught
Aimed , with that self-same Shaft

He no sooner heard the Law
But the Arrow home did draw

And ( to gain her by his Art
Left it sticking in my Heart

Which when she beheld to bleed
She repented of the deed

And would fain have chang 'd the fate
But the pity comes too late

Looser-like , now , all my wreak
Is , that I have leave to speak

And in either Prose , or Song
To revenge me with my Tongue

Which how Dexterously I do
Hear and make Example too

As she goes , all Hearts do duty
Unto her Beauty

And enamour 'd , do wish , so they might
But enjoy such a sight

That they still were to run by her side
Through Swords , through Seas , whither she would ride

Do but mark , her Forehead 's smoother
Than words that sooth her

And from her arched Brows , such a Grace
Sheds it self through the face

As alone there triumphs to the life
All the Gain , all the Good of the Elements strife

Ha ' you felt the Wooll of Bever
Or Swans Down ever

Or have smelt o ' the Bud o ' the Briar
Or the Nard in the fire

Or have tasted the Bag of the Bee
O so white ! O so soft ! O so sweet is she

NOblest Charis , you that are
Both my Fortune , and my Star

And do govern more my Blood
Than the various Moon the Flood

Hear , what late discourse of you
Love and I have had ; and true

'Mongst my Muses finding me
Where he chanc't your Name to see

Set , and to this softer Strain
Sure , said he , if I have Brain

This here sung , can be no other
By description , but my Mother

So hath Homer prais 'd her Hair
So Anacreon drawn the Air

Of her Face , and made to rise
Just about her sparkling Eyes

Both her Brows bent like my Bow
By her Looks I do her know

Which you call my Shafts . And see
Such my Mothers Blushes be

As the Bath your Verse discloses
In her Cheeks of Milk and Roses

Such as oft I wanton in
And , above her even Chin

Have you plac 'd the Bank of Kisses
Where you say , Men gather Blisses

Rip'ned with a breath more sweet
Than when Flowers , and West-winds meet

Nay , her white and polish 'd Neck
With the Lace that doth it deck

Is my Mothers ! Hearts of slain
Lovers , made into a Chain

And between each rising Breast
Lies the Valley , call 'd my Nest

Where I sit and preen my Wings
After flight ; and put new stings

To my Shafts ! Her very Name
With my Mothers , is the same

I confess all , I replyed
And the Glass hangs by her side

And the Girdle 'bout her waste
All is Venus , save unchaste

But alas , thou seest the least
Of her good , who is the best

Of her Sex : But could'st thou , Love
Call to mind the Forms that strove

For the Apple , and those three
Make in one , the same were she

For this Beauty yet doth hide
Something more than thou hast spied

Outward Grace weak Love beguiles
She is Venus , when she smiles

But she 's Juno , when she walks
And Minerva , when she talks

CHaris , guess , and do not miss
Since I drew a Morning Kiss

From your Lips , and suck 'd an air
Thence , as sweet , as you are fair

What my Muse and I have done
Whether we have lost , or won

If by us , the odds were laid
That the Bride ( allow 'd a Maid

Look 'd not half so fresh and fair
With th ' advantage of her Hair

And her Jewels , to the view
Of th ' Assembly , as did you

Or , that did you sit , or walk
You were more the Eye , and talk

Of the Court , to day , than all
Else that glister 'd in White-hall

So , as those that had your sight
Wisht the Bride were chang 'd to Night

And did think such Rites were due
To no other Grace but you

Or , if you did move to Night
In the Dances , with what spight

Of your Peers , you were beheld
That at every Motion swelled

So to see a Lady tread
As might all the Graces lead

And was worthy ( being so seen
To be envi 'd of the Queen

Or if you would yet have stayed
Whether any would up-braid

To himself his loss of Time
Or have charg 'd his sight of Crime

To have left all sight for you
Guess of these , which is the true

And , if such a Verse as this
May not claim another Kiss

FOr Loves-sake , kiss me once again
I long , and should not beg in vain

Once more , and ( faith ) I will be gone
Can he that loves , ask less than one

I will but mend the last and tell
Where , how it would have relish 'd well

CHaris one day in discourse
Had of Love , and of his force

Lightly promis 'd , she would tell
What a Man she could love well

And that promise set on fire
All that heard her , with desire

With the rest , I long expected
When the work would be effected

But we find that cold delay
And Excuse spun every day

As , until she tell her one
We all fear , she loveth none

Therefore , Charis , you must do't
For I will so urge you to't

You shall neither eat , nor sleep
No , nor forth your Window peep

With your Emissary Eye
To fetch in the Forms go by

And pronounce , which Band or Lace
Better fits him than his Face

Nay , I will not let you sit
'Fore your Idol Glass a whit

To say over every purl
There ; or to reform a curl

Or with Secretary Sis
To consult , if Fucus this

Be as good , as was the last
All your sweet of Life is past

Make accompt , unless you can
( And that quickly ) speak your Man

OF your Trouble , Ben , to ease me
I will tell what Man would please me

I would have him , if I could
Noble ; or of greater Blood

Titles , I confess , do take me
And a Woman God did make me

French to boot , at least in fashion
And his Manners of that Nation

Young I'ld have him too , and fair
Yet a Man ; with crisped Hair

Cast in thousand Snares and Rings
For Love 's Fingers , and his Wings

Chesnut Colour , or more slack
Gold , upon a Ground of Black

Venus and Minerva 's Eyes
For he must look wanton-wise

Eye-brows bent , like Cupid 's Bow
Front , an ample Field of Snow

Even Nose , and Cheek , ( withal
Smooth as is the Billiard Ball

Chin as woolly as the Peach
And his Lip should kissing teach

Till he cherish 'd too much Beard
And make Love or me afeard

He would have a Hand as soft
As the Down , and shew it oft

Skin as smooth as any Rush
And so thin to see a Blush

Rising through it , e 're it came
All his Blood should be a Flame

Quickly fir 'd , as in beginners
In Loves School , and yet no sinners

'Twere too long to speak of all
What we Harmony do call

In a body should be there
Well he should his Clothes to wear

Yet no Taylor help to make him
Drest , you still for Man should take him

And not think h ' had eat a Stake
Or were set up in a Brake

Valiant he should be as fire
Shewing danger more than Ire

Bounteous as the Clouds to Earth
And as honest as his Birth

All his Actions to be such
As to do nothing too much

Nor o'er-praise , nor yet condem
Nor out-value , nor contemn

Nor do Wrongs , nor Wrongs receive
Nor tie Knots , nor Knots unweave

And from baseness to be free
As he durst love Truth and Me

Such a Man , with every part
I could give my very Heart

But of one , if short he came
I can rest me where I am

FOr his Mind , I do not care
That 's a Toy that I could spare

Let his Title be but great
His Clothes rich , and Band sit neat

Himself young , and Face be good
All I wish is understood

What you please , you parts may call
'T is one good part I'ld lie withal

We have both Wits , and Fancies too
And if we must , let 's sing of you

We shall at last , of parcels make
One good enough for a Songs sake

And having pleas 'd our Art , we 'll try
To make a new , and hang that by

Take that away , you take our Lives
We are no Women then , but Wives

The frequent varying of the Deed
Is that which doth Perfection breed

The good , from bad , is not descried
But as 't is often vext and tried

Yet if it be not known
The Pleasure is as good as none

It were a plague 'bove Scorn
And yet it can not be forborn

That are this Morning blown
Yet , yet I doubt he is not known

But then t ' increase my fears
What Nymph soe'er his Voice but hears

But so exempt from blame
As it would be to each a Fame

And in his Mrs.Mistress ' Flame , playing like a Fly
Turn 'd to Cinders by her Eye

Yes ; and in Death , as Life unblest
To have't exprest

For else it could not be
That she

I 'm sure my Language to her , was as sweet
And every close did meet

As hath the youngest He
That sits in shadow of Apollo 's Tree

That fly my thoughts between
Tell me that she hath seen

Read so much waste , as she can not embrace
My Mountain Belly , and my Rocky Face

WRetched and foolish Jealousie
How cam'st thou thus to enter me

I ne'er was of thy kind
Nor have I yet the narrow Mind

To vent that poor desire
That others should not warm them at my fire

I wish the Sun should shine
On all Mens Fruits and Flowers , as well as mine

But under the Disguise of Love
Thou say'st , thou only cam'st to prove

What my affections were
Think'st thou that Love is help 'd by Fear

Go , get thee quickly forth
Loves sickness , and his noted want of worth

Seek doubting Men to please
I ne'er will owe my Health to a Disease

OR Scorn , or pity on me take
I must the true Relation make

Love in a subtil Dream disguised
Hath both my Heart and me surprised

Whom never yet he durst attempt t ' awake
Nor will he tell me for whose sake

He did me the Delight
Or Spight

But leaves me to inquire
In all my wild desire

Of sleep again , who was his aid
And sleep so guilty and afraid

IHave my Piety too , which could
It vent it self , but as it would

Would say as much , as both have done
Before me here , the Friend and Son

For I both lost a Friend and Father
Of him whose bones this Grave doth gather

Dear Vincent Corbet , who so long
Had wrestled with Diseases strong

That though they did possess each Limb
Yet he broke them , e 're they could him

With the just Canon of his Life
A Life that knew nor Noise , nor Strife

But was by sweetning so his Will
All Order and Disposure , still

His Mind as pure , and neatly kept
As were his Nourceries , and swept

So of Uncleanness , or Offence
That never came ill odour thence

And add his Actions unto these
They were as specious as his Trees

'T is true , he could not reprehend
His very Manners , taught t ' amend

They were so even , grave , and holy
No Stubbornness so stiff , nor Folly

To license ever was so light
As twice to trespass in his sight

His Looks would so correct it , when
It chid the Vice , yet not the Men

Much from him , I profess , I won
And more , and more , I should have done

But that I understood him scant
Now I conceive him by my want

And pray who shall my sorrows read
That they for me their Tears will shed

For truly , since he left to be
I feel , I 'm rather dead than he

Reader , whose Life , and Name , did e'er become
An Epitaph , deserv 'd a Tomb

Nor wants it here through Penury , or Sloth
Who makes the one , so 't be first , makes both

IF Sackvile , all that have the power to do
Great and good Turns , as well could time them too

And knew their how , and where : we should have then
Less list of proud , hard , or ingrateful Men

For benefits are ow 'd with the same Mind
As they are done , and such Returns they find

You then whose Will not only , but Desire
To succour my Necessities , took fire

Not at my Prayers , but your Sense ; which laid
The way to meet , what others would upbraid

And in the Act did so my blush prevent
As I did feel it done , as soon as meant

You can not doubt , but I who freely know
This Good from you , as freely will it owe

And though my Fortune humble me , to take
The smallest Courtesies with Thanks , I make

Yet choice from whom I take them ; and would shame
To have such do me good , I durst not name

They are the noblest benefits , and sink
Deepest in Man , of which when he doth think

The Memory delights him more , from whom
Then what he hath receiv 'd . Gifts stink from some

They are so long a coming , and so hard
Where any Deed is forc't , the Grace is marred

Can I owe Thanks for Courtesies received
Against his Will that does 'em ? That hath weaved

Excuses , or Delays ? or done 'em scant
That they have more opprest me than my want

Or if he did it not to succour me
But by meer Chance ? for Interest ? or to free

Himself of farther trouble , or the weight
Of pressure , like one taken in a streight

All this corrupts the thanks , less hath he won
That puts it in his Debt-book ere't be done

Or that doth sound a Trumpet , and doth call
His Grooms to witness ; or else lets it fall

In that proud manner ; as a good so gained
Must make me sad for what I have obtained

No ! Gifts and Thanks should have one cheerful Face
So each that 's done , and tane , becomes a Brace

He neither gives , or do 's , that doth delay
A Benefit : or that doth throw't away

No more than he doth thank , that will receive
Nought but in corners , and is loth to leave

Lestrare form of 'Least ' Air , or Print , but flies it : Such Men would
Run from the Conscience of it , if they could

As I have seen some Infants of the Sword
Well known , and practis 'd Borrowers on their Word

Give thanks by stealth , and whispering in the Ear
For what they straight would to the World forswear

And speaking worst of those , from whom they went
But then , fist-fill 'd , to put me off the scent

Now dam ' me , Sir , if you shall not command
My Sword ( 't is but a poor Sword understand

As far as any poor Sword i ' the Land
Then turning unto him is next at hand

Dam 's whom he damn 'd too , is the veriest Gull
H'as Feathers , and will serve a Man to pull

Are they not worthy to be answer 'd so
That to such Natures let their full Hands flow

And seek not wants to succour : but enquire
Like Money-brokers , after Names , and hire

Their bounties forth , to him that last was made
Or stands to be'n Commission o ' the Blade

Still , still the Hunters of false Fame apply
Their Thoughts and Means to making loud the Cry

But one is bitten by the Dog he fed
And hurt , seeks Cure ; the Surgeon bids , take bread

And Spunge-like , with it dry up the blood quite
Then give it to the Hound that did him bite

Pardon , says he , that were a way to see
All the Town-Curs take each their snatch at me

O , is it so ? knows he so much ? and will
Feed those , at whom the Table points at still

I not deny it , but to help the need
Of any , is a Great and Generous Deed

Yea , of th ' ingrateful : and he forth must tell
Many a Pound , and Piece will pace one well

But these Men ever want : their very Trade
Is borrowing ; that but stopt , they do invade

All as their Prize , turn Pyrates here at Land
Ha ' their Bermudas , and their Streights i ' th ' Strand

Man out of their Boats to th ' Temple , and not shift
Now , but command ; make Tribute what was Gift

And it is paid 'em with a trembling Zeal
And Superstition , I dare scarce reveal

If it were clear ; but being so in Cloud
Carried and wrapt , I only am alowed

My Wonder ! Why ? the taking a Clown 's Purse
Or robbing the poor Market-folks , should nurse

Such a Religious Horror in the Breasts
Of our Town-Gallantry ! or why there rests

Such Worship due to kicking of a Punck
Or swaggering with the Watch , or Drawer drunk

Or feats of Darkness acted in Mid-Sun
And told of with more License than th ' were done

Sure there is Mystery in it , I not know
That Men such Reverence to such actions show

And almost Deifie the Authors ! make
Loud Sacrifice of Drink , for their Healths-sake

Rear Suppers in their Names ! and spend whole Nights
Unto their Praise , in certain swearing Rites

Can not a Man be reck'ned in the State
Of Valour , but at this Idolatrous rate

I thought that Fortitude had been a mean
'Twixt Fear and Rashness ; not a Lust obscene

Or appetite of offending , but a Skill
Or Science of a discerning Good and Ill

And you , Sir , know it well , to whom I write
That with these Mixtures we put out her Light

Her Ends are Honesty , and Publick Good
And where they want , she is not understood

No more are these of us , let them then go
I have the list of mine own Faults to know

Look too and cure : He 's not a Man hath none
But like to be , that every day mends one

And feels it : Else he tarries by the Beast
Can I discern how Shadows are decreast

Or grown ; by height or lowness of the Sun
And can I less of Substance ? when I run

Ride , sail , am coach 'd , know I how far I have gone
And my Minds Motion not ? or have I none

No ! he must feel and know , that I will advance
Men have been great , but never good by chance

Or on the sudden . It were strange , that he
Who was this Morning such a one , should be

Sydney ere Night ? or that did go to bed
Coriat , should rise the most sufficient Head

Of Christendom ? And neither of these know
Were the Rack offer 'd them , how they came so

'T is by degrees that Men arrive at glad
Profit , in ought each day some little add

In time 'twill be a heap : This is not true
Alone in Money , but in Manners too

Yet we must more than move still , or go on
We must accomplish : 'T is the last Key-stone

That makes the Arch ; the rest that there were put
Are nothing till that comes to bind and shut

Then stands it a triumphal Mark ! then Men
Observe the strength , the height , the why , and when

It was erected ; and still walking under
Meet some new Matter to look up and wonder

Such Notes are Vertuous Men ! they live as fast
As they are high ; are rooted , and will last

They need no Stilts , nor rise upon their Toes
As if they would belie their stature ; those

Are Dwarfs of Honour , and have neither weight
Nor fashion , if they chance aspire to height

'T is like light Canes , that first rise big and brave
Shoot forth in smooth and comely spaces ; have

But few and fair Divisions : but being got
Aloft , grow less and streightned ; full of Knot

And last , go out in nothing : You that see
Their difference , can not choose which you will be

You know ( without my flatt'ring you ) too much
For me to be your Indice . Keep you such

That I may love your Person ( as I do
Without your Gift , though I can rate that too

By thanking thus the Courtesie to life
Which you will bury , but therein , the strife

May grow so great to be Example , when
( As their true Rule or Lesson ) either Men

Donnor 's or Donnee 's to their practice shall
Find you to reckon nothing , me owe all

IKnow to whom I write here , I am sure
Though I am short , I can not be obscure

Less shall I for the Art or Dressing care
Truth , and the Graces best , when naked are

Your Book , my Selden , I have read , and much
Was trusted , that you thought my Judgment such

To ask it : Though in most of Works it be
A Penance , where a Man may not be free

Rather than Office , when it doth , or may
Chance that the Friends affection proves allay

Unto the Censure . Yours all need doth fly
Of this so Vitious Humanity

Than which there is not unto Study , a more
Pernicious Enemy , we see before

A many of Books , even good Judgments wound
Themselves through favouring what is there not found

But I on yours far otherwise shall do
Not fly the Crime , but the Suspicion too

Though I confess ( as every Muse hath erred
And mine not least ) I have too oft preferred

Men past their terms , and prais 'd some Names too much
But 't was with purpose to have made them such

Since being deceiv 'd , I turn a sharper Eye
Upon my self , and ask to whom ? and why

And what I write ? and vex it many days
Before Men get a Verse ; much less a Praise

So that my Reader is assur 'd , I now
Mean what I speak , and still will keep that Vow

Stand forth my Object , then , you that have been
Ever at home ; yet have all Countries seen

And like a Compass , keeping one Foot still
Upon your Center , do your Circle fill

Of general Knowledge ; watch 'd Men , Manners too
Heard what times past have said , seen what ours do

Which Grace shall I make love to first ? your Skill
Or Faith in things ? or is't your Wealth and Will

T ' instruct and teach ? or your unweary 'd pain
Of Gathering ? Bounty in pouring out again

What Fables have you vext ! what Truth redeemed
Antiquities search 'd ! Opinions dis-esteemed

Impostures branded , and Authorities urged
What Blots and Errors have you watch 'd and purged

Records and Authors of ! how rectified
Times , Manners , Customs ! Innovations spied

Sought out the Fountains , Sources , Creeks , Paths , Ways
And noted the Beginnings and Decays

Where is that Nominal Mark , or Real Rite
Form , Act or Ensign , that hath scap 'd your sight

How are Traditions there examin 'd ! how
Conjectures retreiv 'd ! and a Story now

And then of Times ( besides the bare Conduct
Of what it tells us ) weav 'd in to instruct

I wonder 'd at the Richness , but am lost
To see the Workmanship so 'xceed the Cost

To mark the excellent seas'ning of your Stile
And Manly Elocution , not one while

With Horror rough , then rioting with Wit
But to the Subject still the Colours fit

In sharpness of all Search , wisdom of Choice
Newness of Sense , Antiquity of Voice

I yeild , I yeild , the matter of your Praise
Flows in upon me , and I can not raise

A bank against it . Nothing but the round
Large clasp of Nature , such a Wit can bound

Monarch in Letters ! 'Mongst thy Titles shown
Of others Honours , thus , enjoy their own

I first salute thee so ; and gratulate
With that thy Stile , thy keeping of thy State

In offering this thy work to no great Name
That would , perhaps , have prais 'd , and thank 'd the same

But nought beyond . He thou hast given it to
Thy Learned Chamber-fellow , knows to do

It true respects . He will not only love
Embrace and cherish ; but he can approve

And estimate thy Pains ; as having wrought
In the same Mines of Knowledge ; and thence brought

Humanity enough to be a Friend
And strength to be a Champion , and defend

Thy Gift 'gainst envy . O how I do count
Among my comings in , and see it mount

The Grain of your Two Friendships ! Hayward and
Selden ! Two Names that so much understand

On whom I could take up , and ne'er abuse
The Credit , what would furnish a tenth Muse

But here 's no time , nor place , my Wealth to tell
You both are modest . So am I. Farewel

WAke , Friend , from forth thy Lethargy : the Drum
Beats brave , and loud in Europe , and bids come

All that dare rowse : or are not loth to quit
Their vitious Ease , and be o'erwhelm 'd with it

It is a call to keep the Spirits alive
That gasp for action , and would yet revive

Man 's buried Honour , in his sleepy Life
Quickning dead Nature , to her noblest strife

All other acts of Worldlings are but toil
In dreams , begun in hope , and end in spoil

Look on th ' ambitious Man , and see him nurse
His unjust hopes , with praises begg 'd , or ( worse

Bought Flatteries , the issue of his Purse
Till he become both their , and his own Curse

Look on the false , and cunning Man , that loves
No person , nor is lov 'd : what ways he proves

To gain upon his belly ; and at last
Crush 'd in the Snaky Brakes , that he had past

See the grave , sower , and supercilious Sir
In outward Face , but inward , light as Fur

Or Feathers : lay his Fortune out to show
Till Envy wound , or maim it at a blow

See him that 's call 'd , and thought the happiest Man
Honour 'd at once , and envy 'd ( if it can

Be , Honour is so mixt ) by such as would
For all their spight , be like him , if they could

No part or corner Man can look upon
But there are Objects bid him to be gone

As far as he can fly , or follow Day
Rather than here so bogg 'd in Vices stay

The whole World here leaven 'd with Madness swells
And being a thing blown out of nought , rebels

Against his Maker ; high alone with Weeds
And impious Rankness of all Sects and Seeds

Nor to be check 'd , or frighted now with Fate
But more licentious made , and desperate

Our Delicacies are grown capital
And even our Sports are Dangers ! what we call

Friendship is now mask 'd Hatred ! Justice fled
And Shamefac'dness together ! All Laws dead

That kept Man living ! Pleasures only sought
Honour and Honesty , as poor things thought

As they are made ! Pride and stiff Clownage mixt
To make up Greatness ! and Mans whole good fixed

In Bravery , or Gluttony , or Coyn
All which he makes the Servants of the Groin

Thither it flaws , flows how much did Stallion spend
To have his Court-bred-filly there commend

His Lace and Starch : And fall upon her back
In admiration , stretch 'd upon the Rack

Of Lust , to his rich Suit and Title , Lord
I , that 's a Charm and half ! She must afford

That all Respect ; She must lie down : Nay , more
'T is there Civility to be a Whore

He 's one of Blood and Fashion ! and with these
The Bravery makes , she can no Honour leese

To do't with Cloth , or Stuffs , Lusts Name might merit
With Velvet , Plush , and Tissues , it is Spirit

O , these so ignorant Monsters ! light , as proud
Who can behold their Manners , and not Clowd-

Like upon them lighten ? If Nature could
Not make a Verse , Anger or Laughter would

To see 'em aye discoursing with their Glass
How they may make some one that day an Ass

Planting their Purls , and Curls , spread forth like Net
And every Dressing for a Pitfall set

To catch the Flesh in , and to pound a Prick
Be at their Visits , see 'em squeamish , sick

Ready to cast at one , whose Band sits ill
And then leap mad on a neat Pickardill

As if a Brize were gotten i ' their Tail
And firk , and jerk , and for the Coach-man rail

And jealous each of other , yet think long
To be abroad , chanting some bawdy Song

And laugh , and measure Thighs , then squeak , spring , itch
Do all the Tricks of a salt Lady Bitch

For t'other Pound of Sweet-meats , he shall feel
That pays , or what he will . The Dame is Steel

For these with her young Company she 'll enter
Where Pittes , or Wright , or Modet would not venter

And comes by these Degrees the Stile t ' inherit
Of Woman of Fashion , and a Lady of Spirit

Nor is the Title question 'd with our proud
Great , brave , and fashion 'd folk , these are allowed

Adulteries now , are not so hid , or strange
They 're grown Commodity upon Exchange

He that will follow but another 's Wife
Is lov 'd , though he let out his own for life

The Husband now 's call 'd churlish , or a poor
Nature , that will not let his Wife be a Whore

Or use all Arts , or haunt all Companies
That may corrupt her , even in his Eyes

The Brother trades a Sister ; and the Friend
Lives to the Lord , but to the Ladies End

Less must not be thought on than Mistris : or
If it be thought , kill 'd like her Embrions ; for

Whom no great Mistris , hath as yet infamed
A Fellow of course Letchery , is named

The Servant of the Serving-Woman in scorn
Ne'er came to taste the plenteous Marriage-Horn

Thus they do talk . And are these Objects fit
For Man to spend his Money on ? his Wit

His Time ? Health ? Soul ? Will he for these go throw
Those Thousands on his Back , shall after blow

His Body to the Counters , or the Fleet
Is it for these that fine Man meets the Street

Coach 'd , or on Foot-cloth , thrice chang 'd every day
To teach each Suit , he has the ready way

From Hide-Park to the Stage , where at the last
His dear and borrow 'd Bravery he must cast

When not his Combs , his Curling-Irons , his Glass
Sweet Bags , sweet Powders , nor sweet Words will pass

For less Security ? O god for these
Is it that Man pulls on himself Disease

Surfeit ? and Quarrel ? Drinks the tother Health
Or by Damnation voids it ? or by stealth

What Fury of late is crept into our Feasts
What Honour given to the Drunkennest Guests

What Reputation to bear one Glass more
When oft the Bearer is borne out of Door

This hath our ill-us 'd Freedom , and soft Peace
Brought on us , and will every Hour increase

Our Vices , do not tarry in a place
But being in Motion still ( or rather in Race

Tilt one upon another , and now bear
This way , now that , as if their number were

More than themselves , or than our Lives could take
But both fell prest under the load they make

I 'll bid thee look no more , but flee , flee Friend
This PrÂÃ¦cipice , and Rocks that have no end

Or side , but threatens Ruin . The whole Day
Is not enough now , but the Nights to play

And whilst our States , Strength , Body , and Mind we waste
Go make our selves the Usurers at a cast

He that no more for Age , Cramps , Palsies , can
Now use the Bones , we see doth hire a Man

To take the Box up for him ; and pursues
The Dice with glassen Eyes , to the glad Viewers views

Of what he throws : Like Letchers grown content
To be beholders , when their Powers are spent

Can we not leave this Worm ? or will we not
Is that the truer Excuse ? or have we got

In this , and like , an itch of Vanity
That scratching now 's our best Felicity

Well , let it go . Yet this is better than
To lose the Forms , and Dignities of Men , Man

To flatter my good Lord , and cry his Bowl
Runs sweetly , as it had his Lordship 's Soul

Although , perhaps it has , what 's that to me
That may stand by , and hold my peace ? will he

When I am hoarse , with praising his each Cast
Give me but that again , that I must waste

In Sugar Candid , or in butter 'd Beer
For the recovery of my Voice ? No , there

Pardon his Lordship . Flatt'ry 's grown so cheap
With him , for he is followed with that heap

That watch , and catch , at what they may applaud
As a poor single Flatterer , without Bawd

Is nothing , such scarce Meat and Drink he 'll give
But he that 's both , and slave to both , shall live

And be belov 'd , while the Whores last . O Times
Friend fly from hence , and let these kindled Rhymes

Light thee from Hell on Earth ; where Flatterers , Spies
Informers , Masters both of Arts and Lies

Lewd Slanderers , soft Whisperers , that let blood
The life , and Fame-Veins ( yet not understood

Of the poor Sufferers ) where the envious , proud
Ambitious , factious , superstitious , loud

Boasters , and perjur 'd , with the infinite more
PrÂÃ¦varicators swarm : Of which the Store

( Because th'are every where amongst Mankind
Spread through the World ) is easier far to find

Than once to number , or bring forth to hand
Though thou wert Muster-Master of the Land

Go quit 'em all . And take along with thee
Thy true Friends Wishes , Colby which shall be

That thine be just , and honest , that thy Deeds
Not wound thy Conscience , when thy Body bleeds

That thou dost all things more for Truth than Glory
And never but for doing Wrong be sorry

That by commanding first thy self , thou mak'st
Thy Person fit for any Charge thou tak'st

That Fortune never make thee to complain
But what she gives , thou dar'st give her again

That whatsoever Face thy Fate puts on
Thou shrink , or start not ; but be always one

That thou think nothing great , but what is good
And from that thought strive to be understood

So , 'live or dead , thou wilt preserve a Fame
Still precious , with the Odour of thy Name

And last , blaspheme not , we did never hear
Man thought the valianter , 'cause he durst swear

No more , than we should think a Lord had had
More Honour in him , 'cause we'ave known him mad

These take , and now go seek thy peace in War
Who falls for love of God , shall rise a Star

Reader , stay
And if I had no more to say

But here doth lie till the last Day
All that is left of PHILIP GRAY

For if such Men as he could die
What surety of Life have thou and I

THey are not , Sir , worst Owers , that do pay
Debts when they can : good men may break their day

And yet the noble Nature never grudge
'T is then a Crime , when the Usurer is Judge

And he is not in Friendship . Nothing there
Is done for Gain : If't be , 't is not sincere

Nor should I at this time protested be
But that some greater Names have broke with me

And their Words too ; where I but break my Band
I add that ( but ) because I understand

That as the lesser breach : for he that takes
Simply my Band , his trust in me forsakes

And looks unto the Forfeit . If you be
Now so much Friend , as you would trust in me

Venture a longer time , and willingly
All is not barren Land doth fallow lie

Some Grounds are made the richer for the Rest
And I will bring a Crop , if not the best

CAn Beauty that did prompt me first to write
Now threaten , with those means she did invite

Did her perfections call me on to gaze
Then like , then love ; and now would they amaze

Or was she gracious a-far off ? but near
A terror ? or is all this but my fear

That as the Water makes things , put i n't , streight
Crooked appear ; so that doth my conceit

I can help that with boldness ; and Love swear
And Fortune once , t ' assist the Spirits that dare

But which shall lead me on ? both these are blind
Such Guides men use not , who their way would find

Except the way be error to those ends
And then the best are still , the blindest Friends

Oh how a Lover may mistake ! to think
Or love , or fortune blind , when they but wink

To see men fear : or else for truth , and state
Because they would free Justice imitate

Vail their own Eyes , and would impartially
Be brought by us to meet our Destiny

If it be thus ; Come Love , and Fortune go
I 'll lead you on ; or if my fate will so

That I must send one first , my Choice assigns
Love to my Heart , and Fortune to my Lines

BY those bright Eyes , at whose immortal fires
Love lights his Torches to inflame desires

By that fair stand , your Forehead , whence he bends
His double Bow , and round his Arrows sends

By that tall Grove , your Hair , whose globy rings
He flying curles and crispeth with his Wings

By those pure Bathes your either Cheek discloses
Where he doth steep himself in Milk and Roses

And lastly by your Lips , the bank of kisses
Where men at once may plant and gather blisses

Tell me ( my lov 'd Friend ) do you love or no
So well as I may tell in Verse , 't is so

You blush , but do not : Friends are either none
( Though they may number bodies ) or but one

I 'll therefore ask no more , but bid you love
And so that either may example prove

Unto the other ; and live Patterns , how
Others , in time may love , as we do now

Slip no occasion ; as time stands not still
I know no Beauty , nor no Youth that will

To use the present , then , is not abuse
You have a Husband is the just excuse

Of all that can be done him ; such a one
As would make shift , to make himself alone

That which we can , who both in you , his Wife
His Issue , and all Circumstance of life

As in his place , because he would not vary
Is constant to be extraordinary

A Womans friendship ! God whom I trust in
Forgive me this one foolish deadly sin

Amongst my many other , that I may
No more , I am sorry for so fond cause , say

At fifty Years , almost , to value it
That ne'er was known to last above a fit

Or have the least of Good , but what it must
Put on for fashion , and take up on trust

Knew I all this afore ? had I perceived
That their whole life was wickedness , though weaved

Of many Colours ; outward fresh , from spots
But their whole inside full of ends and knots

Knew I that all their Dialogues and discourse
Were such as I will now relate , or worse

Knew I this Woman ? yes ; and you do see
How penitent I am , or I should be

Do not you ask to know her , she is worse
Than all Ingredients made into one curse

And that pour 'd out upon Man-kind can be
Think but the Sin of all her Sex , 't is she

I could forgive her being proud ! a whore
Perjur 'd ! and painted ! if she were no more

But she is such , as she might yet forestall
The Devil , and be the damning of us all

ASk not to know this Man . If fame should speak
His name in any Metal , it would break

Two Letters were enough the Plague to tear
Out of his Grave , and poyson every Ear

A parcel of Court-dirt , a heap , and mass
Of all Vice hurld together , there he was

Proud , false , and treacherous , vindictive , all
That thought can add , unthankful , the Lay-stall

Of putrid Flesh alive ! of Blood , the sink
And so I leave to stir him , lest he stink

And yours of whom I sing be such
As not the World can praise too much

Throughout your form ; as though that move
And draw , and conquer all mens love

'T is of your self , and that you use
The noblest freedom , not to choose

In whom alone love lives agen
By whom he is restor 'd to men

The withered Garlands tane away
His Altars kept from the Decay

With so much Loyalties expence
As Love t ' aquit such excellence

To whom all Lovers are designed
That would their better objects find

Have sung this Hymn , and here intreat
One spark of your Diviner heat

Appear , and that to shortest view
Yet give me leave t ' adore in you

Knowledge , that sleeps , doth die
And this Security

It is the common Moath
That eats on Wits , and Arts , and destroys them both

Doth Clarius Harp want Strings
That not a Nymph now sings

Or droop they as disgrac't
To see their Seats and Bowers by chattring Pies defac't

Let this thought quicken thee
Minds that are great and free

Should not on Fortune pause
'T is crown enough to Vertue still , her own applause

Of worded Balladry
And think it Poesie

They die with their conceits
And only pitious scorn , upon their folly waits

With Japhet 's Line , aspire
Sol 's Chariot for new Fire

To give the World again
Who aided him , will thee , the issue of Jove 's Brain

Make not thy self a Page
To that Strumpet the Stage

But sing high and aloof
Safe from the Wolves black Jaw , and the dull Asses Hoof

Times Witness , Herald of Antiquity
The Light of Truth , and Life of Memory

High , as his mind , that doth advance
Her upright Head , above the reach of Chance

Or the times envy
Cynthius , I apply

My bolder numbers to thy golden Lyre
O , then inspire

Then shall my Verses , like strong Charms
Break the knit Circle of her Stony Arms

That hold your Spirit
And keeps your merit

Lock't in her cold Embraces , from the view
Of Eyes more true

But whisper ; O glad Innocence
Where only a Man 's Birth is his offence

Or the dis-favour
Of such a savour

Nothing , but practise upon Honours thrall
O Vertues fall

And , after all the ÂÃ†tnean Ire
Gold , that is perfect , will out-live the Fire

For Fury wasteth
As Patience lasteth

No Armour to the mind ! he is shot-free
From injury

If I auspiciously divine
( As my hope tells ) that our fair Ph â€œ Â© Â« b 's Shine

Shall light those places
With lustrous Graces

Where darkness with her gloomy Sceptred Hand
Doth now command

I send nor Balms , nor Cor'sives to your wound
Your Fate hath found

The Cure of that , which is but corporal
And doubtful Days ( Which were nam 'd Critical

Have made their fairest flight
And now are out of sight

Wrapt in this Paper lie
Which in the taking if you mis-apply

Happy in that fair Honour it hath gained
Must now be rained

In one full Action ; nor have you now more
To do , than be a Husband of that store

Think but how dear you bought
This same which you have caught

'T is Wisdom , and that high
For Men to use their Fortune reverently

HEllen , did Homer never see
Thy Beauties , yet could write of thee

Did Sappho on her seven-tongu 'd Lute
So speak ( as yet it is not mute

Of Phaos form ? or doth the Boy
In whom Anacreon once did joy

Lie drawn to Life , in his soft Verse
As he whom Maro did rehearse

Was Lesbia sung by learn 'd Catullus
Or Delia 's Graces , by Tibullus

Doth Cynthia , in Propertius song
Shine more , than she the Stars among

Is Horace his each Love so high
Rap't from the Earth , as not to die

With bright Lycoris , Gallus choice
Whose Fame hath an Eternal Voice

Or hath Corynna , by the name
Her Ovid gave her , dimn 'd the fame

Of CÂÃ¦sar 's Daughter , and the Line
Which all the World then stil 'd Divine

Hath Petrarch since his Laura raised
Equal with her ? or Ronsart praised

His new Cassandra , 'bove the old
Which all the Fate of Troy foretold

Hath our great Sydney , Stella set
Where never Star shone brighter yet

Or Constables Ambrosiack Muse
Made Dian , not his Notes refuse

Have all these done ( and yet I miss
The Swan that so relish 'd Pancharis

And shall not I my Celia bring
Where Men may see whom I do sing

Though I , in working of my Song
Come short of all this learned throng

Yet sure my Tunes will be the best
So much my subject drowns the rest

Though not in these , in Rhymes not wholly dumb
Since I exscribe your Sonnets , am become

A better Lover , and much better Poet
Nor is my Muse or I asham 'd to owe it

To those true numerous Graces ; whereof some
But charm the Senses , others overcome

His Flames , his Shafts , his Quiver , and his Bow
His very Eyes are yours to overthrow

Her Joys , her Smiles , her Loves , as Readers take
For Venus Ceston , every Line you make

Rhyme the rack of finest Wits
That expresseth but by fits

True Conceit
Spoiling Senses of their Treasure

Cosening Judgment with a Measure
But false Weight

Wresting words , from their true calling
Propping Verse , for fear of falling

To the Ground
Joynting Syllables , drowning Letters

Fast'ning Vowels , as with Fetters
They were bound

Soon as lazie thou wert known
All good Poetry hence was flown

And are banished
For a thousand Years together

All Pernassus Green did wither
And Wit vanished

Pegasus did fly away
At the Wells no Muse did stay

But bewailed
So to see the Fountain dry

And Apollo 's Musick die
All Light failed

Starveling Rhymes did fill the Stage
Not a Poet in an Age

Worth crowning
Not a Work deserving Bays

Nor a Line deserving praise
Pallas frowning

Greek was free from Rhymes infection
Happy Greek by this protection

Was not spoiled
Whilst the Latin , Queen of Tongues

Is not yet free from Rhymes wrongs
But rests foiled

Scarce the Hill again doth flourish
Scarce the World a Wit doth nourish

To restore
Ph â€œ Â© Â« bus to his Crown again

And the Muses to their Brain
As before

Vulgar Languages that want
Words , and sweetness , and be scant

Of true measure
Tyran Rhyme hath so abused

That they long since have refused
Other ceasure

He that first invented thee
May his Joynts tormented be

Cramp 'd for ever
Still may Syllables jar with time

Still may Reason war with Rhyme
Resting never

May his Sense when it would meet
The cold tumor in his Feet

Grow unsounder
And his Title be long Fool

That in rearing such a School
Was the founder

IF thou wouldst know the Vertues of Mankind
Read here in one , what thou in all canst find

And go no farther : let this Circle be
Thy Universe , though his Epitome

Cecil , the Grave , the Wise , the Great , the Good
What is there more that can ennoble Blood

The Orphan 's Pillar , the true Subjects Shield
The Poors full Store-house , and just Servants Field

The only faithful Watchman for the Realm
That in all Tempests , never quit the Helm

But stood unshaken in his Deeds , and Name
And labour 'd in the Work ; not with the Fame

That still was good for goodness sake , nor thought
Upon Reward , till the Reward him sought

Whose Offices , and Honours did surprize
Rather than meet him : And , before his Eyes

Clos 'd to their peace , he saw his Branches shoot
And in the Noblest Families took root

Of all the Land , who now at such a rate
Of divine Blessing , would not serve a State

SO , justest Lord , may all your Judgments be
Laws ; and no change e'er come to one Decree

So , may the King proclaim your Conscience is
Law , to his Law ; and think your Enemies his

So , from all Sickness , may you rise to Health
The care , and wish still of the publick Wealth

So may the gentler Muses , and good Fame
Still fly about the Odour of your Name

As with the safety , and honour of the Laws
You favour Truth , and me , in this Man 's Cause

THe Judge his Favour timely then extends
When a good Cause is destitute of Friends

Without the pomp of Counsel ; or more aid
Than to make Falshood blush , and Fraud afraid

When those good few , that her Defenders be
Are there for Charity , and not for Fee

Such shall you hear to Day , and find great Foes
Both arm 'd with Wealth , and slander to oppose

Who thus long safe , would gain upon the times
A right by the prosperity of their Crimes

Who , though their Guilt , and Perjury they know
Think , yea and boast , that they have done it so

As though the Court pursues them on the scent
They will come of , off and scape the Punishment

When this appears , just Lord , to your sharp sight
He do 's you wrong , that craves you to do right

THat I hereafter , do not think the Bar
The Seat made of a more than Civil War

Or the great Hall at Westminster , the Field
Where mutual frauds are fought , and no side yield

That henceforth , I believe nor Books , nor Men
Who 'gainst the Law , weave Calumnies my Benn

But when I read or hear the names so rife
Of Hirelings , Wranglers , Stitchers-to of strife

Hook-handed Harpies , gowned Vultures , put
Upon the reverend Pleaders ; do now shut

All Mouthes , that dare entitle them ( from hence
To the Wolves study , or Dogs eloquence

Thou art my Cause : whose manners since I knew
Have made me to conceive a Lawyer new

So dost thou study Matter , Men , and Times
Mak'st it Religion to grow rich by Crimes

Dar'st not abuse thy Wisdom , in the Laws
Or Skill to carry out an evil Cause

But first doth vex , and search it ! If nor sound
Thou prov'st the gentler ways , to cleanse the wound

And make the Scar fair ; If that will not be
Thou hast the brave scorn , to put back the fee

But in a business , that will bide the touch
What use , what strength of reason ! and how much

Of Books , of Precedents hast thou at hand
As if the general store thou didst command

Of Argument , still drawing forth the best
And not being borrowed by thee , but possest

So com'st thou like a Chief into the Court
Arm 'd at all Pieces , as to keep a Fort

Against a multitude ; and ( with thy Stile
So brightly brandish 'd ) wound'st , defend'st ! the while

Thy Adversaries fall , as not a word
They had , but were a Reed unto thy Sword

Then com'st thou off with Victory and Palm
Thy Hearers Nectar , and thy Clients Balm

The Courts just Honour , and thy Judges Love
And ( which doth all Atchievements get above

Thy sincere practise , breeds not thee a Fame
Alone , but all thy rank a reverend Name

ENvious and foul Disease , could there not be
One beauty in an Age , and free from thee

What did she worth thy spight ? were there not store
Of those that set by their false Faces more

Than this did by her true ? she never sought
Quarrel with Nature , or in balance brought

Was drawn to practise other hue , than that
Her own Blood gave her : She ne'er had , nor hath

Or Turners Oil of Talk . Nor ever got
Spanish Receipt , to make her Teeth to rot

What was the cause then ? Thought'st thou in disgrace
Of Beauty , so to nullifie a Face

That Heaven should make no more ; or should amiss
Make all hereafter , had'st thou ruin 'd this

I , that thy aim was ; but her fate prevailed
And scorn 'd , thou'ast shown thy malice , but hast failed

And , till the coming of the Soul
To fetch the Flesh , we keep the Roll

COme , let us here enjoy the shade
For Love in shadow best is made

Though Envy oft his shadow be
None brooks the Sun-light worse than he

Where Love doth shine , there needs no Sun
All Lights into his one doth run

Without which all the World were dark
Yet he himself is but a spark

A Spark to set whole World a-fire
Who more they burn , they more desire

And have their being , their waste to see
And waste still , that they still might be

Such are his powers , whom time hath stiled
Now swift , now slow , now tame , now wild

Now hot , now cold , now fierce , now mild
The eldest God , yet still a Child

SIr , I am thankful , first , to Heaven , for you
Next to your self , for making your love true

You have unto my Store added a Book
On which with profit , I shall never look

Not like your Country Neighbours , that commit
Their vice of loving for a Christmas fit

But , as a Friend , which name your self receive
And which you ( being the worthier ) gave me leave

Which , how most sacred I will ever keep
So may the fruitful Vine my Temples steep

Though you sometimes proclaim me too severe
Rigid , and harsh , which is a Drug austere

Little know they , that profess Amity
And seek to scant her comely Liberty

And less they know , who being free to use
That friendship which no chance but love did choose

It is an act of Tyranny , not Love
In practis 'd friendship wholly to reprove

From each of which I labour to be free
Yet if with eithers Vice I tainted be

For no Man lives so out of Passions sway
But shall sometimes be tempted to obey

TIs true , I'am broke ! Vows , and all I had
Of Credit lost . And I am now run mad

Or do upon my self some desperate ill
This sadness makes no approaches , but to kill

It is a Darkness hath blockt up my sense
And drives it in to eat on my offence

Or there to starve it . Help O you that may
Alone lend succours , and this fury stay

Offended Mistris , you are yet so fair
As Light breaks from you , that affrights despair

And fills my powers with perswading joy
That you should be too noble to destroy

There may some face or menace of a storm
Look forth , but can not last in such a form

If there be nothing worthy you can see
Of graces , or your mercy here in me

Spare your own goodness yet ; and be not great
In will and power , only to defeat

God , and the good , know to forgive , and save
The ignorant , and fools , no pity have

I will not stand to justifie my fault
Or lay the excuse upon the Vinter 's Vault

Or in confessing of the Crime be nice
Or go about to countenance the vice

By naming in what company 't was in
As I would urge Authority for sin

No , I will stand arraign 'd , and cast , to be
The subject of your Grace in pardoning me

And ( stil 'd your mercies Creature ) will live more
Your honour now , than your disgrace before

Think it was frailty , Mistris , think me Man
Think that your self like Heaven forgive me can

Where Weakness doth offend , and Vertue grieve
There Greatness takes a glory to relieve

Think that I once was yours , or may be now
Nothing is vile , that is a part of you

Errour and Folly in me may have crost
Your just Commands ; yet those , not I be lost

I am regenerate now , become the Child
Of your Compassion ; Parents should be mild

There is no Father that for one demerit
Or two , or three , a Son will disinherit

That is the last of Punishments is meant
No Man inflicts that Pain , till Hope be spent

An ill-affected Limb ( what e'er it ail
We cut not off , till all Cures else do fail

And then with pause ; for sever 'd once , that 's gone
Would live his Glory that could keep it on

Do not despair my mending ; to distrust
Before you prove a Med'cine , is unjust

You may so place me , and in such an Air
As not alone the Cure , but Scar be fair

That is , if still your Favours you apply
And not the Bounties you have done , deny

Could you demand the Gifts you gave , again
Why was't ? Did e'er the Clouds ask back their Rain

The Sun , his Heat and Light ? the Air his Dew
Or Winds the Spirit by which the Flower so grew

That were to wither all , and make a Grave
Of that wise Nature would a Cradle have

Her Order is to cherish , and preserve
Consumption 's , Nature to destroy and starve

But to exact again what once is given
Is Natures meer Obliquity ; as Heaven

Should ask the Blood and Spirits he hath infused
In Man , because Man hath the Flesh abused

O may your Wisdom take example hence
God lightens not at Man 's each frail Offence

He pardons Slips , goes by a World of Ills
And then his Thunder frights more than it kills

He can not angry be , but all must quake
It shakes even him , that all things else doth shake

And how more fair and lovely looks the World
In a calm Sky , than when the Heaven is hurled

About in Clouds , and wrapt in raging Weather
As all with Storm and Tempest ran together

O imitate that sweet Serenity
That makes us live , not that which calls to die

In dark and sullen Morns ; do we not say
This looketh like an Execution day

And with the Vulgar doth it not obtain
The name of Cruel Weather , Storm , and Rain

Be not affected with these Marks too much
Of Cruelty , lest they do make you such

But view the mildness of your Makers State
As I the Penitents here emulate

He , when he sees a Sorrow , such as this
Streight puts off all his Anger , and doth kiss

The contrite Soul , who hath no thought to win
Upon the hope to have another Sin

Forgiven him : And in that Line stand I
Rather than once displease you more , to die

To suffer Tortures , Scorn , and Infamy
What Fools , and all their Parasites can apply

The Wit of Ale , and Genius of the Malt
Can pump for , or a Libel without Salt

Produce ; though threatning with a Coal , or Chalk
On every Wall , and sung where-e'er I walk

I number these , as being of the Chore
Of Contumely , and urge a good Man more

Than Sword , or Fire , or what is of the Race
To carry noble Danger in the Face

There is not any punishment , or pain
A Man should fly from , as he would disdain

Then Masters here , here let your Rigour end
And let your Mercy make me asham 'd t ' offend

I will no more abuse my Vows to you
Than I will study Falshood , to be true

O , that you could but by dissection see
How much you are the better part of me

How all my Fibres by your Spirit do move
And that there is no Life in me , but Love

You would be then most confident , that tho
Publick Affairs command me now to go

Out of your Eyes , and be a while away
Absence , or Distance , shall not breed decay

Your Form shines here , here fixed in my Heart
I may dilate my self , but not depart

Others by common Stars their Courses run
When I see you , then I do see my Sun

Till then 't is all but Darkness , that I have
Rather than want your Light , I wish a Grave

TO make the Doubt clear , that no Woman 's true
Was it my Fate to prove it full in you

Thought I but one had breath 'd the purer Air
And must she needs be false , because she 's fair

It is your Beauties Mark , or of your Youth
Or your Perfection , not to study Truth

Or think you Heaven is deaf , or hath no Eyes
Or those it has , wink at your Perjuries

Are Vows so cheap with Women ? or the matter
Whereof they are made , that they are writ in Water

And blown away with Wind ? or doth their Breath
Both hot and cold at once , threat Life and Death

Who could have thought so many Accents sweet
Tun 'd to our Words , so many Sighs should meet

Blown from our Hearts , so many Oaths and Tears
Sprinkled among ? all sweeter by our Fears

And the divine Impression of stoln Kisses
That seal 'd the rest , could now prove empty Blisses

Did you draw Bonds to forfeit ? sign to break
Or must we read you quite from what you speak

And find the Truth out the wrong way ? or must
He first desire you false , would wish you just

O , I profane ! Though most of Women be
The common Monster , Love , shall except thee

My dearest Love , however Jealousie
With Circumstance might urge the contrary

Sooner I 'll think the Sun would cease to chear
The teeming Earth , and that forget to bear

Sooner that Rivers would run back , or Thames
With Ribs of Ice in June would bind his Streams

Or Nature , by whose strength the World endures
Would change her Course , before you alter yours

But , O that treacherous Breast , to whom weak you
Did trust our Counsels , and we both may rue

Having his Falshood found too late ! 't was he
That made me cast you Guilty , and you me

Whilst he , black Wretch , betray 'd each simple VVord
VVe spake unto the coming of a third

Curst may he be that so our Love hath slain
And wander wretched on the Earth , as Cain

VVretched as he , and not deserve least pity
In plaguing him , let Misery be witty

Let all Eyes shun him , and he shun each Eye
Till he be noisom as his Infamy

May he without remorse deny God thrice
And not be trusted more on his Soul 's price

And after all self-torment , when he dies
May Wolves tear out his Heart , Vultures his Eyes

Swine eat his Bowels , and his falser Tongue
That utter 'd all , be to some Raven flung

And let his Carrion Coarse be a longer Feast
To the King 's Dogs , than any other Beast

Now I have curst , let us our Love receive
In me the Flame was never more alive

I could begin again to court and praise
And in that Pleasure lengthen the short days

Of my Lifes Lease ; like Painters that do take
Delight , not in made Works , but whilst they make

I could renew those Times , when first I saw
Love in your Eyes , that gave my Tongue the Law

To like what you lik 'd , and at Masques , or Plays
Commend the self-same Actors , the same Ways

Ask how you did , and often with intent
Of being officious , grow impertinent

All which were such lost Pastimes , as in these
Love was as subtly catch 'd as a Disease

But , being got , it is a Treasure , sweet
Which to defend , is harder than to get

And ought not be profan 'd on either part
For though 't is got by Chance , 't is kept by Art

THat Love 's a bitter-sweet , I ne'er conceive
Till the sowr Minute comes of taking leave

And then I taste it . But as Men drink up
In haste the bottom of a med'cin 'd Cup

And take some Sirrup after ; so do I
To put all rellish from my memory

Of parting , drown it , in the hope to meet
Shortly again , and make our absence sweet

This makes me , Mistris , that sometimes by stealth
Under another Name , I take your Health

And turn the Ceremonies of those Nights
I give , or owe my Friends , into your Rites

But ever without Blazon , or least Shade
Of Vows so sacred , and in silence made

For though Love thrive , and may grow up with chear
And free Society , he 's born elsewhere

And must be bred , so to conceal his Birth
As neither Wine do rack it out , or Mirth

Yet should the Lover still be airy and light
In all his Actions , rarified to Sprite

Not , like a Midas , shut up in himself
And turning all he toucheth into Pelf

Keep in reserv 'd in his Dark-lantern Face
As if that exc'lent Dulness were Loves Grace

No , Masters , no , the open merry Man
Moves like a spritely River , and yet can

Keep secret in his Channels what he breeds
'Bove all your standing Waters , choak 'd with Weeds

They look at best like Cream-bowls , and you soon
Shall find their depth , they 're sounded with a Spoon

They may say Grace , and for Loves Chaplains pass
But the grave Lover ever was an Ass

Is fix 'd upon one Leg , and dares not come
Out with the other , for he 's still at home

Like the dull wearied Crane , that ( come on Land
Doth while he keeps his Watch , betray his Stand

Where he that knows , will like a Lapwing fly
Far from the Nest , and so himself belie

To others , as he will deserve the Trust
Due to that one that doth believe him just

And such your Servant is , who vows to keep
The Jewel of your Name , as close as Sleep

Can lock the Sense up , or the Heart a Thought
And never be by Time or Folly brought

Weakness of Brain , or any Charm of Wine
The Sin of Boast , or other Countermine

( Made to blow up Loves Secrets ) to discover
That Article may not become our Lover

Which in assurance to your Breast I tell
If I had writ no word , but Dear , farewel

SInce you must go , and I must bid Farewell
Hear , 'Mistress ' your departing Servant tell

What it is like : And do not think they can
Be idle Words , though of a parting Man

It is as if a Night should shade Noon-day
Or that the Sun was here , but forc't away

And we were left under that Hemisphere
Where we must feel it dark for half a Year

What Fate is this , to change Mens Days and Hours
To shift their Seasons , and destroy their Powers

Alas ! I ha ' lost my Heat , my Blood , my Prime
Winter is come a Quarter e'er his time

My Health will leave me ; and when you depart
How shall I do , sweet Mistris , for my Heart

You would restore it ? No , that 's worth a fear
As if it were not worthy to be there

O , keep it still ; for it had rather be
Your Sacrifice , than here remain with me

And so I spare it , Come what can become
Of me , I 'll softly tread unto my Tomb

Or like a Ghost walk silent amongst Men
Till I may see both it and you agen

LEt me be what I am ; as Virgil , cold
As Horace , fat ; or as Anacreon , old

No Poets Verses yet did ever move
Whose Readers did not think he was in love

Who shall forbid me then in Rhyme to be
As light and active as the youngest he

That from the Muses Fountains doth indorse
His Lines , and hourly sits the Poets Horse

Put on my Ivy Garland , let me see
Who frowns , who jealous is , who taxeth me

Fathers and Husbands , I do claim a Right
In all that is call 'd lovely : take my sight

Sooner than my affection from the Fair
No Face , no Hand , Proportion , Line , or Air

Of Beauty , but the Muse hath interest in
There is not worn that Lace , Purl , Knot , or Pin

But is the Poets Matter ; and he must
When he is furious , love , although not lust

But then content , your Daughters and your Wives
( If they be fair and worth it ) have their Lives

Made longer by our Praises : or , if not
Wish , you had foul ones , and deformed got

Curst in their Cradles , or there chang 'd by Elves
So to be sure you do enjoy your selves

Yet keep those up in Sackcloth too , or Leather
For Silk will draw some sneaking Songster thither

It is a Rhyming Age , and Verses swarm
At every Stall ; the City Cap 's a Charm

But I who live , and have liv 'd twenty Year
Where I may handle Silk , as free , and near

As any Mercer , or the Whalebone-man
That quilts those Bodies I have leave to span

Have eaten with the Beauties , and the Wits
And Braveries of Court , and felt their Fits

Of Love and Hate ; and came so nigh to know
Whether their Faces were their own , or no

It is not likely I should now look down
Upon a Velvet Petticoat , or a Gown

Whose like I have known the Taylor 's Wife put on
To do her Husband 's Rites in , e'er 'twere gone

Home to the Customer : his Letchery
Being , the best Clothes still to preoccupy

Put a Coach-mare in Tissue , must I horse
Her presently ? or leap thy Wife of force

When by thy sordid Bounty she hath on
A Gown of that was the Caparison

So I might dote upon thy Chairs and Stools
That are like cloth 'd : Must I be of those Fools

Of race accounted , that no Passion have
But when thy Wife ( as thou conceiv'st ) is brave

Then ope thy Wardrobe , think me that poor Groom
That from the Foot-man , when he was become

An Officer there , did make most solemn Love
To ev'ry Petticoat he brush 'd , and Glove

He did lay up , and would adore the Shooe
Or Slipper was left off , and kiss it too

Court every hanging Gown , and after that
Lift up some one , and do , I tell not what

Thou didst tell me , and wert o'er-joy 'd to peep
In at a hole , and see these Actions creep

From the poor Wretch , which though he plaid in Prose
He would have done in Verse , with any one of those

Wrung on the Withers , by Lord Loves despight
Had he had the Faculty to read and write

Such Songsters there are store of ; witness he
That chanc 'd the Lace , laid on a Smock , to see

And streight-way spent a Sonnet ; with that other
That ( in pure Madrigal ) unto his Mother

Commended the French-Hood , and Scarlet Gown
The Lady Mayress pass 'd in through the Town

Unto the Spittle Sermon . O , what strange
Variety of Silks were on th ' Exchange

Or in Moore-fields ! this other night , sings one
Another answers , Lass those Silks are none

In smiling L'envoye , as he wou 'd deride
Any Comparison had with his Cheap-side

And vouches both the Pageant , and the Day
When not the Shops , but Windows do display

The Stuffs , the Velvets , Plushes , Fringes , Lace
And all the original Riots of the Place

Let the poor Fools enjoy their Follies , love
A Goat in Velvet ; or some Block could move

Under that cover ; an old Mid-wives Hat
Or a Close-stool so cas 'd ; or any fat

Bawd , in a Velvet Scabber 'd ! I envy
None of their Pleasures ! nor will ask thee , why

Thou art jealous of thy Wives , or Daughters Case
More than of eithers Manners , Wit , or Face

ANd why to me this , thou lame Lord of Fire
What had I done that might call on thine Ire

Or urge thy greedy Flame , thus to devour
So many my Years-labours in an hour

I ne 're attempted Vulcan 'gainst thy Life
Nor made least Line of Love to thy loose Wife

Or in remembrance of thy afront , and scorn
With Clowns , and Tradesmen , kept thee clos 'd in Horn

'T was Jupiter that hurl 'd thee headlong down
And Mars , that gave thee a Lanthorn for a Crown

Was it because thou wert of old denied
By Jove to have Minerva for thy Bride

That since thou tak'st all envious care and pain
To ruine any Issue of the Brain

Had I wrote Treason there , or Heresie
Imposture , Whitchcraft , Charms , or Blasphemy

I had deserv 'd then , thy consuming Looks
Perhaps , to have been burned with my Books

But , on thy Malice , tell me , didst thou spy
Any , least loose , or surrilescurrile Paper , lye

Conceal 'd , or kept there , that was fit to be
By thy own Vote , a Sacrifice to thee

Did I there wound the Honours of the Crown
Or tax the Glories of the Church and Gown

Itch to defame the State ? or brand the Times
And my self most , in some self-boasting Rhymes

If none of these , then why this Fire ? Or find
A Cause before ; or leave me one behind

Had I compil 'd from Amadis de Gaule
Th ' Esplandians , Arthur 's , Palmerins , and all

The learned Library of Don Quixote
And so some goodlier Monster had begot

Or spun out Riddles , and weav 'd fittyfifty Tomes
Of Logogriphes , and curious Palindromes

Or pomp 'd for those hard Trifles Anagrams
Or Eteostichs , or those finer Flams

Of Eggs , and Halberds , Cradles , and a Hearse
A pair of Scisars , and a Comb in Verse

Acrostichs , and Telestichs , on jump Names
Thou then hadst had some colour for thy Flames

On such my serious Follies ; But , thou'lt say
There were some Pieces of as base allay

And as false stamp there ; parcels of a Play
Fitter to see the Fire-light , than the day

Adulterate Moneys , such as might not go
Thou should'st have stay 'd , till publick Fame said so

She is the Judge , Thou Executioner
Or if thou needs would'st trench upon her Power

Thou mightst have yet enjoy 'd thy Cruelty
With some more thrift , and more variety

Thou mightst have had me perish , piece by piece
To light Tobacco , or save roasted Geese

Sindge Capons , or poor Piggs , droping their Eyes
Condemn 'd me to the Ovens with the Pies

And so , have kept me dying a whole Age
Not ravish 'd all hence in a Minutes rage

But that 's a mark , whereof thy Rights do boast
To make Consumption , ever where thou go'st

Had I fore-known of this thy least desire
T ' have held a Triumph , or a Feast of Fire

Especially in Paper ; that , that steam
Had tickled your large Nostril : many a Ream

To redeem mine , I had sent in enough
Though should'st have cry 'd , and all been proper Stuff

The Talmud , and the Alcoran had come
With Pieces of the Legend ; The whole sum

Of Errant Knight-hood , with the Dames , and Dwarfs
The charmed Boats , and the inchanted Wharfs

The Tristram 's , Lanc'lots , Turpins , and the Peer 's
All the mad Rolands , and sweet Oliveer 's

To Merlins Marvails , and his Caballs loss
With the ChimÂÃ¦ra of the Rosie-Cross

Their Seals , their Characters , Hermetick Rings
Their Jem of Riches , and bright Stone , that brings

Invisibility , and strength , and Tongues
The Art of kindling the true Coal , by Lungs

With Nicholas Pasquill 's , Medle with your match
And the strong Lines , that so the time do catch

Or Captain Pamphlets Horse , and Foot ; that sally
Upon th ' Exchange , still out of Popes-head-Alley

The weekly Corrants , with Poules Seal ; and all
The admir 'd discourses of the Prophet Ball

These , had'st thou pleas 'd either to dine or sup
Had made a Meal for Vulcan to lick up

But in my Desk , what was there to accite
So ravenous and vast an Appetite

I dare not say a Body , but some Parts
There were of search , and mastry in the Arts

All the old Venusine , in Poetry
And lighted by the Stagerite , could spy

Was there madmade English : with the Grammar too
To teach some that their Nurses could 'not ' omitted do

The purity of Language ; and among
The rest , my Journey into Scotland Song

With all th ' Adventures ; Three Books not afraid
To speak the Fate of the Sicilian Maid

To our own Ladies ; and in Story there
Of our Fifth Henry , eight of his nine year

Wherein was Oil , beside the Succour spent
Which Noble Carew , Cotton , Selden lent

And twice-twelve-years stor 'd up Humanity
With humble Gleanings in Divinity

After the Fathers , and those wiser Guides
Whom Faction had not drawn to study sides

How in these Ruins Vulcan , thou dost lurk
All Soot and Embers ! odious , as thy work

I now begin to doubt , if ever Grace
Or Goddess , could be patient of thy Face

Thou woo Minerva ! or to wit aspire
'Cause thou canst halt , with us in Arts and Fire

Son of the Wind ! for so thy Mother gone
With Lust conceiv 'd thee ; Father thou hadst none

When thou wert born , and that thou look'st at best
She durst not kiss , but flung thee from her Breast

And so did Jove , who ne 're meant thee his Cup
No marl the Clowns of Lemnos took thee up

For none but Smiths would have made thee a God
Some Alchimist there may be yet , or odd

Squire of the Squibs , against the Pageant day
May to thy name a Vulcanale say

And for it lose his Eyes with Gun-powder
As th ' other may his Brains with Quick-silver

Well-fare the Wise-man yet , on the Banck-side
My Friends , the Water-men ! They could provide

Against thy Fury , when to serve their needs
They made a Vulcan of a Sheaf of Reeds

Whom they durst handle in their Holy-day Coats
And safely trust to dress , not burn their Boats

But , O those Reeds ! thy meer disdain of them
Made thee beget that cruel Stratagem

( Which , some are pleas 'd to stile but thy mad Pranck
Against the Globe , the Glory of the Bank

Which , though it were the Fort of the whole Parish
Flanck 'd with a Ditch , and forc 'd out of a Marish

I saw with two poor Chambers taken in
And raz 'd ; e 're thought could urge , this might have been

See the World 's Ruines ! nothing but the Piles
Left ! and wit since to cover it with Tiles

The Brethren , they streight nois 'd it out for News
'T was verily some Relick of the Stews

And this a Sparkle of that Fire let loose
That was lock 'd up in the Winchestrian Goose

Bred on the Banck , in time of Popery
When Venus there maintain 'd in Mystery

But , others fell , with that conceit by the Ears
And cry 'd , it was a threatning to the Bears

And that accursed Ground , the Parish Garden
Nay , sigh 'd , ah Sister 't was the Nun , Kate Arden

Kindled the Fire ! But , then did one return
No Fool would his own harvest spoil , or burn

If that were so , thou rather would'st advance
The Place , that was thy Wives Inheritance

O no , cry 'd all . Fortune , for being a Whore
Scap 'd not his Justice and Jot the more

He burnt that Idol of the Revels too
Nay , let White-Hall with Revels have to do

Though but in Dances , it shall know his Power
There was a Judgment shew'n too in an Hour

He is true Vulcan still ! He did not spare
Troy , though it were so much his Venus care

Fool , wilt thou let that in Example come
Did not she save from thence , to build a Rome

And what hast thou done in these petty Spights
More then advanc 'd the Houses , and their Rights

I will not argue thee , from those of guilt
For they were burnt , but to be better built

'T is true , that in thy wish they were destroyed
Which thou hast only vented , not enjoyed

So would'st th ' have run upon the Rolls by stealth
And didst invade part of the Common-wealth

In those Records , which were all Chronicles gone
Will be remembred by Six Clerks , to one

But , say all Six , Good Men , what answer ye
Lyes there no Writ , out of the Chancery

Against this Vulcan ? No Injunction
No Order ? no Decree ? Though we be gone

At Common-Law , Methinks in his despight
A Court of Equity should do us right

But to confine him to the Brew-houses
The Glass-house , Dye-fats , and their Furnaces

To live in Sea-coal , and go forth in Smoke
Or lest that Vapour might the City choak

Condemn him to the Brick-kills , or some Hill-
Foot ( out in Sussex ) to an Iron Mill

Or in small Fagots have him blaze about
Vile Taverns , and the Drunkards piss him out

Or in the Bell-Mans Lanthorn like a Spy
Burn to a Snuff , and then stink out and dye

I could invent a Sentence , yet were worse
But I 'll conclude all in a civil Curse

Pox on your Flameship , Vulcan ; if it be
To all as fatal as't hath been to me

And to Pauls-Steeple ; which was unto us
'Bove all your Fire-works , had at Ephesus

Or Alexandria ; and though a Divine
Loss remains yet , as unrepair 'd as mine

Would you had kept your Forge , at ÂÃ†tna still
And there made Swords , Bills , Glaves , and Arms your fill

Maintain 'd the Trade at Bilbo ; or else-where
Struck in at Millan with the Cutlers there

Or stay 'd but where the Fryar , and you first met
Who from the Divels-Arse did Guns beget

Or fixt in the Low-Country 's , where you might
On both sides do your mischiefs with delight

Blow up , and ruine , mine , and countermine
Make your Petards , and Granats , all your fine

Engines of Murder , and receive the Praise
Of massacring Man-kind so many ways

We ask your absence here , we all love Peace
And pray the Fruits thereof , and the Increase

So doth the King , and most of the Kings-men
That have good Places : therefore once agen

Pox on thee Vulcan , thy Pandora 's Pox
And all the Evils that flew out of her Box

Light on thee : Or if those Plagues will not do
Thy Wives Pox on thee , and Bess Broughton 's too

WHy yet my noble Hearts they can not say
But we have Powder still for the Kings Day

And Ord'nance too : so much as from the Tower
T ' have wak 'd , if sleeping , Spain 's Ambassadour

Old ÂÃ†sope Gundomar : the French can tell
For they did see it the last tilting well

That we have Trumpets , Armour , and great Horse
Launces , and Men , and some a breaking force

They saw too store of Feathers , and more may
If they stay here , but till Saint George 's Day

All Ensigns of a War , are not yet dead
Nor Marks of Wealth so from our Nation fled

But they may see Gold-Chains , and Pearl worn then
Lent by the London Dames , to the Lords Men

Withal , the dirty pains those Citizens take
To see the Pride at Court , their Wives do make

And the return those thankful Courtiers yield
To have their Husbands drawn forth to the Field

And coming home , to tell what Acts were done
Under the Auspice of young Swynnerton

What a strong Fort old Pimblicoe had been
How it held out ! how ( last ) 't was taken in

Well , I say thrive , thrive brave Artillery-yard
Thou Seed-plot of the War , that hast not spared

Powder , or Paper , to bring up the Youth
Of Lonndon , in the Military Truth

These ten years day ; As all may swear that look
But on thy Practise , and the Posture-book

He that but saw thy curious Captains drill
Would think no more of Vlushing , Flushing or the Brill

But give them over to the common Ear
For that unnecessary Charge they were

Well did thy crafty Clerk , and Knight , Sir Hugh
Supplant bold Panton ; and brought there to view

Translated ÂÃ†lian Tacticks to be read
And the Greek Discipline ( with the modern ) shed

So , in that ground , as soon it grew to be
The City-Question , whether Tilly , or he

Were now the greater Captain ? for they saw
The Berghen Siege , and taking in Breda

So acted to the Life , as Maurice might
And Spinola have blushed at the sight

O happy Art ! and wise Epitome
Of bearing Arms ! most civil Soldiery

Thou canst draw forth thy Forces , and fight dry
The Battels of thy Aldermanity

Without the hazard of a drop of Blood
More then the Surfets , in thee , that day stood

Go on , increast in Vertue ; and in fame
And keep the Glory of the English Name

Up among Nations . In the stead of bold
Beauchamps , and Nevills , Cliffords , Audley 's old

Insert thy Hodges , and those newer Men
As Stiles , Dike , Ditchfield , Millar , Crips , and Fen

That keep the War , though now't be grown more tame
Alive yet , in the noise ; and still the same

And could ( if our great Men would let their Sons
Come to their Schools , ) show 'em the use of Guns

And there instruct the noble English Heirs
In Politick , and Militar Affairs

But he that should perswade , to have this done
For Education of our Lordings ; Soon

Should he hear of Billow , Wind , and Storm
From the Tempestuous Grandlings , who 'll inform

Us , in our bearing , that are thus , and thus
Born , bred , allied ? what 's he dare tutor us

Are we by Book-worms to be aw 'd ? must we
Live by their Scale , that dare do nothing free

Why are we Rich , or Great , except to show
All licence in our Lives ? What need we know

More then to praise a Dog ? or Horse ? or speak
The Hawking Language ? or our Day to break

With Citizens ? let Clowns , and Tradesmen breed
Their Sons to study Arts , the Laws , the Creed

We will believe like Men of our own Rank
In so much Land a year , or such a Bank

That turns us so much Monies , at which rate
Our Ancestors impos 'd on Prince and State

Let poor Nobility be vertuous : We
Descended in a Rope of Titles , be

From Guy , or Bevis , Arthur , or from whom
The Herald will . Our Blood is now become

Past any need of Vertue . Let them care
That in the Cradle of their Gentry are

To serve the State by Councels , and by Arms
We neither love the Troubles , nor the harms

What love you then ? your Whore ? what study ? Gate
Carriage , and Dressing . There is up of late

The Academy , where the Gallants meet
What to make Legs ? yes , and to smell most sweet

All that they do at Plays . O , but first here
They learn and study ; and then practise there

But why are all these Irons i ' the Fire
Of several makings ? helps , helps , t ' attire

His Lordship . That is for his Band , his Hair
This , and that Box his Beauty to repair

This other for his Eye-brows ; hence , away
I may no longer on these Pictures stay

These Carkasses of Honour ; Taylors blocks
Cover 'd with Tissue , whose prosperity mocks

The fate of things : whilst totter 'd Vertue holds
Her broken Arms up , to their empty Moulds

WHat I am not , and what I fain would be
Whilst I inform my self , I would teach thee

My gentle Arthur ; that it might be said
One lesson we have both learn 'd , and well read

I neither am , nor art thou one of those
That hearkens to a Jacks-pulse , when it goes

Nor ever trusted to that friendship yet
Was issue of the Tavern , or the Spit

Much less a Name would we bring up , or nurse
That could but claim a Kindred from the Purse

Those are poor Ties , depend on those false Ends
'T is Vertue alone , or nothing that knits friends

And as within your Office , you do take
No Piece of Money , but you know , or make

Inquiry of the worth : So must we do
First weigh a Friend , then touch and try him too

For there are many Slips , and Counterfeits
Deceit is fruitful . Men have Masks and Nets

But these with wearing will themselves unfold
They can not last . No Lye grew ever old

Turn him , and see his Threds : look , if he be
Friend to himself , that would be friend to thee

For that is first requir 'd . A man be his own
But he that 's too much that , is Friend of none

Then rest , and a Friends value understand
It is a richer Purchase then of Land

HE that should search all Glories of the Gown
And steps of all rais 'd Servants of the Crown

He could not find , then thee of all that store
Whom Fortune aided less , or Vertue more

Such , Coke , were thy beginnings , when thy good
In others evil best was understood

When , being the Srangers help , the poor mans aid
Thy just defences made th ' Oppressor afraid

Such was thy Process , when Integrity
And skill in thee , now , grew Authority

That Clients strove , in Question of the Laws
More for thy Patronage , then for their Cause

And that thy strong and manly Eloquence
Stood up thy Nations fame , her Crowns defence

And now such is thy stand ; while thou dost deal
Desired Justice to the publick Weal

Like Solons self ; explat'st the knotty Laws
With endless Labours , whilst thy Learning draws

No less of Praise , then Readers in all kinds
Of worthiest knowledge , that can take Mens minds

Such is thy All ; that ( as I sung before
None Fortune aided less , or Vertue more

Or if Chance must , to each Man that doth rise
Needs lend an Aid , to thine she had her Eyes

MEn that are safe , and sure , in all they do
Care not what Trials they are put unto

They meet the Fire , the Test , as Martyrs would
And though Opinion stamp them not , are Gold

I could say more of such , but that I fly
To speak my self out too ambitiously

And shewing so weak an Act to vulgar Eyes
Put Conscience and my right to comprimise

Let those that meerly talk , and never think
That live in the wild Anarchy of Drink

Subject to quarrel only ; or else such
As make it their Proficiency , how much

They'ave glutted in , and letcher 'd out that Week
That never yet did friend or friendship seek

But for a Sealing : let these Men protest
Or th'other on their Borders , that will jeast

On all Souls that are absent ; even the dead
Like Flies or Worms , which Mans corrupt Parts fed

That to speak well , think it above all Sin
Of any Company but that they are in

Call every night to Supper in these fits
And are receiv 'd for the Covey of Wits

That censure all the Town , and all th ' Affairs
And know whose Ignorance is more then theirs

Let these Men have their ways , and take their times
To vent their Libels , and to issue Rhymes

I have no Portion in them , nor their deal
Of News they get , to strew out the long Meal

I study other friendships , and more one
Then these can ever be ; or else wish none

What is't to me whether the French Design
Be , or be not , to get the Vall-telline

Or the States Ships sent forth belike to meet
Some hopes of Spain in their West-Indian Fleet

Whether the Dispensation yet be sent
Or that the Match from Spain was ever meant

I wish all well , and pray high Heaven conspire
My Princes safety , and my Kings desire

But if for Honour , we must draw the Sword
And force back that , which will not be restored

I have a Body , yet , that Spirit draws
To live , or fall , a Carkass in the Cause

So far without inquiry what the States
Brunsfield , and Mansfield do this year , my Fates

Shall carry me at Call ; and I 'll be well
Though I do neither hear these news , nor tell

Of Spain or France ; or were not prick 'd down one
Of the late Mystery of Reception

Although my Fame , to his , not under-hears
That guides the Motions , and directs the Bears

But that 's a blow , by which in time I may
Lose all my Credit with my Christmas Clay

And animated Porc'lane of the Court
I , and for this neglect , the courser sort

Of earthen Jars , there may molest me too
Well , with mine own frail Pitcher , what to do

I have decreed ; keep it from waves and press
Lest it be justled , crack 'd made nought , or less

Live to that Point I will , for which I am Man
And dwell as in my Center , as I can

Still looking too , and ever loving Heaven
With reverence using all the Gifts then given

'Mongst which , if I have any friendships sent
Such as are square , well-tag 'd , and permanent

Not built with Canvass , Paper , and false lights
As are the Glorious Scenes , at the great sights

And that there be no fev'ry heats , nor colds
Oily Expansions , or shrunk dirty Folds

But all so clear , and led by Reasons Flame
As but to stumble in her sight were shame

These I will honour , love , embrace , and serve
And free it from all question to preserve

So short you read my Character , and theirs
I would call mine , to which not many Stairs

Are asked to climb . First give me faith , who know
My self a little . I will take you so

As you have writ your self . Now stand , and then
Sir , you are Sealed of the Tribe of Ben

SInce , Bacchus , thou art father
Of Wines , to thee the rather

We dedicate this Cellar
Where new , thou art made Dweller

And Seal thee thy Commission
But 't is with a Condition

That thou remain here Taster
Of all to the great Master

And look unto their Faces
Their Qualities and Races

That both , their Odour take him
And relish merry make him

For Bacchus thou art freer
Of Cares , and Over-seer

Of feast , and merry meeting
And still begin'st the greting

See then thou dost attend him
LyÂÃ¦us , and defend him

By all the Arts of Gladness
From any thought like sadness

So mayst thou still be younger
Than Ph â€œ Â© Â« bus ; and much stronger

To give Mankind their eases
And cure the Worlds Diseases

So may the Muses follow
Thee still , and leave Apollo

And think thy Stream more quicker
Then Hippocrenes Liquor

And thou make many a Poet
Before his Brain do know it

So may there never Quarrel
Have issue from the Barrel

But Venus and the Graces
Pursue thee in all Places

And not a Song be other
Then Cupid , and his Mother

That when King James , above here
Shall feast it , thou maist love there

The Causes and the Guests too
And have thy Tales and Jests too

Thy Circuits , and thy Rounds free
As shall the Feasts fair Grounds be

Be it he hold Communion
In great Saint Georges Union

Or gratulates the Passage
Of some well-wrought Embassage

Whereby he may knit sure up
The wished Peace of Europe

Or else a Health advances
To put his Court in Dances

And set us all on skipping
When with his Royal shipping

The narrow Seas are shady
And Charles brings home the Lady

DO 's the Court-Pucell then so censure me
And thinks I dare not her ? let the World see

What though her Chamber be the very Pit
Where fight the prime Cocks of the Game , for Wit

And that as any are stroke , her Breath creates
New in their stead , out of the Candidates

What though with Tribade lust she force a Muse
And in an EpicÂÃ¦ne fury can write News

Equal with that , which for the best News goes
As airy Light , and as like Wit as those

What though she talk , and can not once with them
Make State , Religion , Bawdry , all a Theam

And as Lip-thirsty , in each words expence
Doth labour with the Phrase more than the Sense

What though she ride two Mile on Holy-days
To Church , as others do to Feasts and Plays

To shew their Tires ? to view , and to be viewed
What though she be with Velvet Gowns indued

And spangled Petticotes brought forth to Eye
As new Rewards of her old secresie

What though she hath won on Trust , as many do
And that her truster fears her ? Must I too

I never stood for any Place : my Wit
Thinks it self nought , though she should value it

I am no States-man , and much less Divine
For Bawdry , 't is her Language , and not mine

Farthest I am from the Idolatry
To Stuffs and Laces , those my man can buy

And trust her I would least , that hath forswore
In Contract twice , what can she perjure more

Indeed , her Dressing some Man might delight
Her Face there 's none can like by Candle-light

Not he , that should the Body have , for Case
To his poor Instrument , now out of grace

Shall I advise thee Pucell ? steal away
From Court , while yet thy Fame hath some small day

The Wits will leave you , if they once perceive
You cling to Lords , and Lords , if them you leave

For Sermoneers : of which now one , now other
They say you weekly invite with Fits o ' th ' Mother

And practise for a Miracle ; take heed
This Age would lend no Faith to Dorrel 's Deed

Or if it would , the Court is the worst Place
Both for the Mothers , and the Babes of grace

For there the Wicked in the Chair of scorn
Will call't a Bastard , when a Prophet 's born

THe Wisdom Madam of your private Life
Where with this while you live a widowed Wife

And the right ways you take unto the right
To conquer Rumour , and triumph on Spight

Not only shunning by your act , to do
Ought that is ill , but the suspicion too

Is of so brave Example , as he were
No Friend to Vertue , could be silent here

The rather when the Vices of the Time
Are grown so Fruitful , and false Pleasures climb

By all oblique Degrees , that killing height
From whence they fall , cast down with their own weight

And though all Praise bring nothing to your Name
Who ( herein studying Conscience , and not Fame

Are in your self rewarded ; yet 'twill be
A chearful Work to all good Eyes , to see

Among the daily Ruins that fall foul
Of State , of Fame , of Body , and of Soul

So great a Vertue stand upright to view
As makes Penelope 's old Fable true

Whilst your Ulisses hath ta'ne leave to go
Countries , and climescomma omitted Manners and Men to know

Only your time you better entertain
Than the great Homer 's Wit , for her , could fain

For you admit no Company , but good
And when you want those Friends , or near in Blood

Or your Allies , you make your Books your Friends
And study them unto the noblest Ends

Searching for Knowledge , and to keep your Mind
The same it was inspir 'd , rich , and refined

These Graces , when the rest of Ladies view
Not boasted in your Life , but practis 'd true

As they are hard , for them to make their own
So are they profitable to be known

For when they find so many meet in one
It will be shame for them , if they have none

HAil happy Genius of this ancient Pile
How comes it all things so about thee smile

The Fire , the Wine , the Men ! and in the midst
Thou stand'st as if some Mystery thou did'st

Pardon , I read it in thy Face , the day
For whose returns , and many , all these pray

And so do I . This is the Sixtieth year
Since Bacon , and thy Lord was born , and here

Son to the grave wise Keeper of the Seal
Fame and Foundation of the English Weal

What then his Father was , that since is he
Now with a Title more to the Degree

England 's High-Chancellor : the destin 'd Heir
In his soft Cradle to his Father 's Chair

Whose even Thred the Fates spin round and full
Out of their choicest and their whitest Wooll

'T is a brave Cause of joy , let it be known
For 'twere a narrow gladness , kept thine own

Give me a deep-crown'd-Bowl , that I may sing
In raising him the Wisdom of my King

TO paint thy Worth , if rightly I did know it
And were but Painter half like thee , a Poet

Ben , I would show it
But in this skill , m ' unskilful Pen will tire

Thou , and thy worth , will still be found far higher
And I a Lier

Then , what a Painter 's here ? or what an eater
Of great Attempts ! when as his skil 's no greater

And he a Cheater
Then what a Poet 's here ! whom , by Confession

Of all with me , to paint without Digression
There 's no Expression

WHen first , my Lord , I saw you back your Horse
Provoke his Metal , and command his Force

To all the uses of the Field and Race
Me thought I read the ancient Art of Thrace

And saw a Centaure , past those Tales of Greece
So seem 'd your Horse ; and you both of a Piece

You shew 'd like Perseus upon Pegasus
Or Castor mounted on his Cyllarus

Or what we hear our home-born Legend tell
Of bold Sir Bevis and his Arundell

Nay , so your Seat his Beauties did endorse
As I began to wish my self a Horse

WAnd surely had I but your Stable seen
Before : I think my Wish absolv 'd had been

For never saw I yet the Muses dwell
Nor any of their Houshold half so well

So well ! as when I saw the Floor and Room
I look 'd for Hercules to be the Groom

And cri 'd , away , with the CÂÃ¦sarian Bread
At these Immortal Mangers Virgil fed

IAm to dine , Friend , where I must be weighed
For a just Wager , and that Wager paid

If I do lose it : And , without a Tale
A Merchant 's Wife is Regent of the Scale

Who when she heard the Match , concluded streight
An ill Commodity ! 'T must make good weight

So that upon the Point , my Corporal fear
Is , she will Play Dame Justice , too severe

And hold me to it close ; to stand upright
Within the Balance ; and not want a Mite

But rather with advantage to be found
Full twenty stone ; of which I lack two Pound

That 's six in Silver ; now within the Socket
Stinketh my Credit , if into the Pocket

It do not come : One Piece I have in store
Lend me , dear Arthur , for a Week five more

And you shall make me good , in Weight , and Fashion
And then to be return 'd ; or Protestation

To go out after till when take this Letter
For your security . I can no better

WOuld God , my Burges , I could think
Thoughts worthy of thy Gift , this Ink

Then would I promise here to give
Verse , that should thee , and me out-live

But since the Wine hath steep 'd my Brain
I only can the Paper stain

Yet with a Dye , that fears no Moth
But Scarlet-like out-lasts the Cloth

YOu won not Verses , Madam , you won me
When you would play so nobly , and so free

A Book to a few Lines : but , it was fit
You won them too , your odds did merit it

So have you gain 'd a Servant , and a Muse
The first of which I fear , you will refuse

And you may justly , being a tardy cold
Unprofitable Chattel , fat and old

Laden with Belly , and doth hardly approach
His Friends , but to break Chairs , or crack a Coach

His weight is twenty Stone within two Pound
And that 's made up as doth th ' Purse abound

Marry the Muse is one , can tread the Air
And stroke the Water , nimble , chast , and fair

Sleep in a Virgins Bosom without fear
Run all the Rounds in a soft Ladies Ear

Widow or Wife , without the jealousie
Of either Suitor , or a Servant by

Such , ( if her Manners like you ) I do send
And can for other Graces her commend

To make you merry on the Dressing-stool
A Mornings , and at Afternoons to Fool

Away ill Company , and help in Rhyme
Your Joan to pass her melancholy time

By this , although you fancy not the Man
Accept his Muse ; and tell , I know you can

How many Verses , Madam , are your due
I can lose none in tendring these to you

I gain , in having leave to keep my Day
And should grow rich , had I much more to pay

FAther John Burges
Necessity urges

My woful Cry
To Sir Robert Pie

And that he will venter
To send my Debenture

Tell him his Ben
Knew the time , when

He lov 'd the Muses
Though now he refuses

To take Apprehension
Of a years Pension

And more is behind
Put him in mind

Christmas is near
And neither good Chear

Mirth , Fooling , nor Wit
Nor any least Fit

Of Gambol or Sport
Will come at the Court

If there be no Money
No Plover , or Coney

Will come to the Table
Or Wine to enable

The Muse , or the Poet
The Parish will know it

Nor any quick-warming-pan help him to Bed
If the Checker be empty , so will be his Head

THou , Friend , wilt hear all Censures ; unto thee
All Mouths are open , and all Stomachs free

Be thou my Books Intelligencer , note
What each Man says of it , and of what Coat

His Judgment is ; If he be wise , and praise
Thank him : if other , he can give no Bays

If his Wit reach no higher , but to spring
Thy Wife a fit of laughter ; a Cramp-ring

Will be reward enough : to wear like those
That hang their richest Jewels i ' their Nose

Like a rung Bear , or Swine : grunting out Wit
As if that Part lay for a [ ] most fit

If they go on , and that thou lov'st a-life
Their perfum 'd Judgments , let them kiss thy Wife

THey talk of Fencing , and the use of Arms
The Art of urging , and avoiding harms

The Noble Science , and the mastring skill
Of making just Approaches how to kill

To hit in Angels , and to clash with time
As all defence , or offence were a chime

I hate such measur 'd , give me metall 'd Fire
That trembles in the blaze , but ( then ) mounts higher

A quick , and dazling motion ! when a Pair
Of Bodies , meet like rarified Air

Their Weapons shot out , with that flame and force
As they out-did the Lightning in the Course

This were a Spectacle ! A sight to draw
Wonder to Valour ! No , it is the Law

Of daring , not to do a Wrong , is true
Valour ! to slight it , being done to you

To know the Heads of Danger ! where 't is fit
To bend , to break , provoke , or suffer it

All this ( my Lord ) is Valour ! This is yours
And was your Fathers ! All your Ancestors

Who durst live great , 'mongst all the Colds and Heats
Of Humane Life ! as all the Frosts and Sweats

Of Fortune ! when , or Death appear 'd , or Bands
And valiant were , with , or without their Hands

IF , Passenger , thou canst but read
Stay , drop a Tear for him that 's dead

Henry , the brave young Lord La-ware
Minerva 's and the Muses Care

What could their Care do 'gainst the Spight
Of a Disease , that lov 'd no light

Of Honour , nor no air of Good
But crept like Darkness through his Blood

Offended with the dazling flame
Of Vertue , got above his Name

No noble Furniture of Parts
No love of Action , and high Arts

No aim at Glory , or in War
Ambition to become a Star

Could stop the Malice of this ill
That spread his Body o'er , to kill

And only his great Soul envyed
Because it durst have noblier dyed

THat you have seen the Pride , beheld the Sport
And all the Games of Fortune , plaid at Court

View 'd there the Market , read the wretched rate
At which there are , would sell the Prince and State

That scarce you hear a publick Voice alive
But whisper 'd Counsels , and those only thrive

Yet are got off thence , with clear Mind and Hands
To lift to Heaven : who is't not understands

Your Happiness , and doth not speak you blest
To see you set apart , thus , from the rest

T ' obtain of God , what all the Land should ask
A Nation 's Sin got pardon 'd ! 'twere a Task

Fit for a Bishops Knees ! O bow them oft
My Lord , till felt grief make our stone-hearts soft

And we do weep , to water , for our sin
He , that in such a flood , as we are in

Of Riot , and Consumption knows the way
To teach the people how to fast , and pray

And do their Penance , to avert God 's Rod
He is the Man , and Favorite of God

GReat C H A R L E S , among the holy Gifts of Grace
Annexed to thy Person , and thy place

'T is not enough ( thy Piety is such
To cure the call 'd Kings Evil with thy touch

But thou wilt yet a Kinglier Mastry try
To cure the Poets Evil , Poverty

And , in these Cures , do'st so thy self enlarge
As thou dost cure our Evil at thy charge

Nay , and in this , thou show'st to value more
One Poet , than of other folk Ten Score

O Piety ! so to weigh the Poors Estates
O Bounty ! so to difference the rates

What can the Poet wish his King may do
But that he cure the Peoples Evil too

WHo dares deny , that all first-Fruits are due
To God , denies the God-head to be true

Who doubts , those Fruits God can with Gain restore
Doth by his doubt , distrust his Promise more

He can , he will , and with large Int'rest pay
What ( at his liking ) he will take away

Then Royal C H A R L E S and M A R Y , do not grutch
That the Almighty 's Will to you is such

But thank his Greatness , and his Goodness too
And think all still the best that he will do

That thought shall make , he will this loss supply
With a long , large , and blest Posterity

For God , whose Essence is so infinite
Can not but heap that Grace he will requite

HOw happy were the Subject ! if he knew
Most pious King , but his own good in you

How many times , Live long , CHARLES , would he say
If he but weigh 'd the Blessings of this Day

And as it turns our joyful Year about
For Safety of such Majesty cry out

Indeed , when had Great Britain greater Cause
Than now , to love the Soveraign and the Laws

When you that reign , are her Example grown
And what are Bounds to her , you make your own

When yonr'your ' -- ' u ' inverted assiduous practice doth secure
That Faith , which she professeth to be pure

When all your Life 's a Precedent of Days
And murmur can not quarrel at your ways

How is she barren grown of Love ! or broke
That nothing can her Gratitude provoke

O Times ! O Manners ! Surfeit bred of Ease
The truly Epidemical Disease

'T is not alone the Merchant , but the Clown
Is Bank-rupt turn 'd ! the Cassock , Cloak , and Gown

Are lost upon accompt , and none will know
How much to Heaven for thee , great C H A R L E S , they owe

ANd art thou born , brave Babe ? Blest be thy Birth
That so hath Crown 'd our Hopes , our Spring , and Earth

The Bed of the chaste Lily , and the Rose
WatWhat Month than May was fitter to disclose

This Prince of Flowers ? Soon shoot thou up , and grow
The same that thou art promis 'd , but be slow

And long in changing . Let our Nephews see
Thee , quickly the Gardens Eye to be

And there to stand so . Haste , now envious Moon
And interpose thy self , ( 'care not how soon

And threat ' the great Eclipse . Two Hours but run
Sol will re-shine . If not , C H A R L E S hath a Son

HAil Mary , full of Grace , it once was said
And by an Angel , to the blessed'st Maid

The Mother of our Lord : Why may not I
( Without profaneness ) yet , a Poet , cry

Hail Mary , full of Honours , to my Queen
The Mother of our Prince ? When was there seen

( Except the Joy that the first Mary brought
Whereby the Safety of Mankind was wrought

So general a Gladness to an Isle
To make the Hearts of a whole Nation smile

As in this Prince ? Let it be lawful , so
To compare small with great , as still we owe

Glory to God . Then , Hail to Mary ! Spring
Of so much Safety to the Realm , and King

P , Publick Joy , remember
This Sixteenth of November

And though the Parish-Steeple
Be silent , to the People

. Mel . What though the thrifty Tower
And Guns there , spare to pour

As fearful to awake
This City , or to shake

. Thal . Yet , let our Trumpets sound
And cleave both Air and Ground

Let every Lyre be strong
Harp , Lute , Theorbo sprung

. Eut . That when the Quire is full
The Harmony may pull

And each Intelligence
May wish it self a Sense

. Terp . Behold the Royal Mary
The Daughter of Great Harry

Comes in the Pomp and Glory
Of all her Brother 's Story

. Erat . She shows so far above
The feigned Queen of Love

As here no Venus were
But that she reigning here

. Call . See , see our active King
Hath taken twice the Ring

Whilst all the ravish 'd Rout
Do mingle in a Shout

. Ura . This day the Court doth measure
Her Joy in State and Pleasure

The Revels , and the Play
Sum up this Crowned Day

. Poly . Sweet ! happy Mary ! All
The People her do call

So fruitful , and so fair
Hath brought the Land an Heir

For in the Genius of a Poet 's Verse
The King 's Fame lives . Go now , deny his Tierce

SOn , and my Friend , I had not call 'd you so
To me ; or been the same to you , if Show

Profit , or Chance had made us : But I know
What , by that Name , we each to other owe

Freedom and Truth ; with love from those begot
Wise-crafts , on which the Flatterer ventures not

His is more safe Commodity , or none
Nor dares he come in the comparison

But as the wretched Painter , who so ill
Painted a Dog , that now his subtler Skill

Was , t ' have a Boy stand with a Club , and fright
All live Dogs from the Lane , and his Shop 's sight

Till he had sold his Piece , drawn so unlike
So doth the Flatt'rer with fair Cunning strike

At a Friend 's Freedom , proves all circling means
To keep him off ; and howsoe'er he gleans

Some of his Forms , he lets him not come near
Where he would fix , for the Distinctions fear

For as at distance , few have Faculty
To judge : So all Men coming near , can spy

Though now of Flattery , as of Picture are
More subtle Works , and finer Pieces far

Than knew the former Ages : yet to Life
All is but Web , and Painting ; be the strife

Never so great to get them : and the ends
Rather to boast rich Hangings , than rare Friends

BRave Infant of Saguntum , clear
Thy coming forth in that great year

When the prodigious Hannibal did Crown
His Rage , with razing your Immortal Town

Thou , looking then about
Ere thou wert half got out

Wise Child , did'st hastily return
And mad'st thy Mothers Womb thine Urn

How summ 'd a Circle didst thou leave Mankind
Of deepest Lore , could we the Center find

Did wiser Nature draw thee back
From out the Horror of that Sack

Where Shame , Faith , Honour , and regard of Right
Lay trampled on ; the Deeds of Death , and Night

Urg 'd , hurried forth , and horled
Upon th ' affrighted World

Sword , Fire , and Famine , with fell Fury met
And all on utmost Ruin set

As , could they but Lifes Miseries fore-see
No doubt all Infants would return like thee

Here 's one out-liv 'd his Peers
And told forth fourscore years

Troubled both Foes and Friends
But ever to no ends

How well at Twenty had he faln , or stood
For three of his fourscore , he did no good

He entred well by Vertuous Parts
Got up and thriv 'd with Honest Arts

He purchas 'd Friends , and Fame , and Honours then
And had his noble Name advanc 'd with Men

But weary of that flight
He stoop 'd in all Mens sight

To sordid flatteries , acts of Strife
And sunk in that dead Sea of Life

So deep , as he did then Death 's Waters sup
But that the Cork of Title buoy 'd him up

Alas , but Morison fell young
He never fell , thou fall'st , my Tongue

He stood a Soldier to the last right end
A perfect Patriot , and a noble Friend

But most a vertuous Son
All Offices were done

By him , so ample , full , and round
In weight , in measure , number , sound

As though his age imperfect might appear
His Life was of Humanity the Sphere

Go now , and tell our Days summ 'd up with Fears
And make them Years

Produce thy Mass of Miseries on the Stage
To swell thine Age

Repeat of things a throng
To shew thou hast been long

By what was done and wrought
In season , and so brought

Each Syllable answer 'd , and was form 'd ; how fair
These make the Lines of Life , and that 's her air

It is not growing like a Tree
In bulk , doth make Man better be

Or standing long an Oak , three hundred year
To fall a log , at last , dry , bold , and sear

A Lily of a Day
Is fairer far , in May

Although it fall , and die that Night
It was the Plant , and FowerFlower of Light

In small proportions , we just Beauties see
And in short measures , Life may perfect be

Call , Noble Lucius , then for Wine
And let thy Looks with gladness shine

Accept this Garland , plant it on thy Head
And think , nay know , thy Morison 's not dead

He leap 'd the present age
Possest with Holy Rage

To see that bright Eternal Day
Of which we Priests , and Poets say

Such truths , as we expect for happy Men
And there he lives with Memory ; and Ben

In this bright Asterism
Where it were Friendship 's Schism

( Were not his Lucius long with us to tarry
To separate these Twi-Lights , the Dioscuri

But Fate doth so alternate the Design
Whilst that in Heaven , this Light on Earth must shine

And shine as you exalted are
Two Names of Friendship , but one Star

Of Hearts the Union . And those not by chance
Made , or Indenture , or Leas 'd out t'advance

The Profits for a time
No Pleasures vain did chime

Of Rhymes , or Riots , at your Feasts
Orgies of Drink , or feign 'd Protests

But simple love of Greatness , and of Good
That knits brave Minds , and Manners , more than Blood

This made you first to know the Why
You lik 'd , then after , to apply

That liking ; and approach so one the tother
Till either grew a Portion of the other

Each stiled by his end
The Copy of his Friend

You liv 'd to be the great Surnames
And Titles , by which all made Claims

Unto the Vertue . Nothing perfect done
But as a CARY , or a MORISON

Was left yet to Mankind
Where they might read , and find

And with the Heart , not Pen
Of Two so early Men

Who , ere the first down-bloomed on the Chin
Had sow 'd these Fruits , and got the Harvest in

POor wretched States , prest by Extremities
Are fain to seek for Succours and Supplies

Disease , the Enemy , and his Ingineers
Want , with the rest of his conceal 'd Compeers

And made those strong approaches by False Braies
Reduicts , Half-Moons , Horn-Works , and such close ways

But lies block 'd up , and streightned , narrow 'd in
Fix 'd to the Bed , and Boards , unlike to win

Unless some saving Honour of the Crown
Dare think it , to relieve , no less Renown

And ever close the Burden of the Song
Still to have such a Charles , but this Charles long

The Wish is great ; but where the Prince is such
What Prayers ( People ) can you think too much

LOok up , thou Seed of Envy , and still bring
Thy faint , and narrow Eyes , to read the King

In his great Actions : view whom his large Hand
Hath rais 'd to be the Port unto his Land

W E S T O N ! that waking Man ! that Eye of State
Who seldom sleeps ! whom bad Men only hate

Why do I irritate , or stir up thee
Thou sluggish Spawn , that canst , but wilt not see

Feed on thy self for spight , and shew thy Kind
To Vertue and true Worth , be ever blind

Dream thou could'st hurt it , but before thou wake
T ' effect it : Feel , thou'ast made thine own Heart ake

SUch Pleasure as the teeming Earth
Doth take in easie Natures Birth

When she puts forth the Life of ev'ry thing
And in a dew of sweetest Rain

She lies deliver 'd without pain
Of the prime Beauty of the Year , the Spring

The Rivers in their Shores do run
The Clouds rack clear before the Sun

The rudest Winds obey the calmest Air
Rare Plants from ev'ry Bank do rise

And ev'ry Plant the Sense surprize
Because the Order of the whole is fair

The very Verdure of her Nest
Wherein she sits so richly drest

As all the Wealth of Season , there was spread
Doth show , the Graces , and the Hours

Have multipli 'd their Arts and Powers
In making soft her Aromatick Bed

Such Joys , such Sweets doth your Return
Bring all your Friends , ( fair Lord ) that burn

With love , to hear your Modesty relate
The bus'ness of your blooming Wit

With all the Fruit shall follow it
Both to the Honour of the King and State

O how will then our Court be pleased
To see great Charles of Travail eased

When he beholds a Graft of his own Hand
Shoot up an Olive fruitful , fair

To be a Shadow to his Heir
And both a Strength , and Beauty to his Land

Than thou shalt see to day
We woo thee , stay

And see , what can be seen
The Bounty of a King , and Beauty of his Queen

When look 'd the Year , at best
So like a Feast

Or were Affairs in tune
By all the Sphears consent , so in the Heart of June

When look 'd the Earth so fine
Or so did shine

In all her bloom and flower
To welcome home a Pair , and deck the Nuptial Bower

Marriage , the end of life
That holy strife

And the allowed War
Through which not only we , but all our Species are

The Lady Frances , drest
Above the rest

Of all the Maidens fair
In graceful Ornament of Garland , Gems , and Hair

Her tresses trim her back
As she did lack

Nought of a Maiden Queen
With Modesty so crown 'd , and Adoration seen

Whose Majesties appear
To make more clear

This Feast , than can the Day
Although that thou , O Sun , at our intreaty stay

Stay , see the Virgins sow
( Where she shall go

The Emblems of their way
O , now thou smil'st , fair Sun , and shin'st , as thou would'st stay

See , at another door
On the same floor

The Bridegroom meets the Bride
With all the Pomp of Youth , and all our Court beside

Save the preceeding Two
Who , in all they do

Search , Sun , and thou wilt find
They are th ' exampled Pair , and Mirror of their Kind

Illustrate these , but they
Themselves to day

Who the whole Act express
All else we see beside , are Shadows , and go less

Be duly done to those
Whom they have chose

And set the Mark upon
To give a greater Name , and Title to ! their own

In all the prov 'd assays
And legal ways

Of Tryals , to work down
Mens Loves unto the Laws , and Laws to love the Crown

That far-all-seeing Eye
Could soon espy

What kind of waking Man
He had so highly set ; and in what Barbican

Doth Emulation stir
To th ' dull , a Spur

It is : to th ' envious meant
A meer upbraiding Grief , and tort'ring punishment

One in the others Hand
Whilst they both stand

Hearing their Charge , and then
The solemn Quire cries , Joy ; and they return , Amen

And knit the Nuptial Knot
Which Time shall not

Or canker 'd Jealousie
With all corroding arts , be able to untie

There is a Feast behind
To them of kind

Which their glad Parents taught
One to the other , long ere these to light were brought

To propagate their Names
And keep their Fames

Alive , which else would die
For Fame keeps Vertue up , and it Posterity

Alone , and such a Race
We pray may grace

Your fruitful spreading Vine
But dare not ask our Wish in Language fescennine

That when you both are old
You find no cold

There ; but renewed , say
( After the last Child born : ) This is our Wedding-day

And 'tween their Grandsires thighs
Like pretty Spies

Peep forth a Gem ; to see
How each one plays his part , of the large Pedigree

Whilst the main Tree still found
Upright and sound

By this Sun 's Noonsted 's made
So great ; his Body now alone projects the shade

Strifes , Murmurs , or Delay
Will last till Day

Night , and the Sheets will show
The longing Couple , all that Elder Lovers know

THat whereas your Royal Father
J A M E S the blessed , pleas 'd the rather

Of his special Grace to Letters
To make all the M U S E S Debtors

To his Bounty , by Extension
Of a free Poetick Pension

A large Hundred Marks Annuity
To be given me in Gratuity

For done Service , and to come
And that this so accepted Sum

Or dispens 'd in Books , or Bread
( For with both the M U S E was fed

Hath drawn on me , from the times
All the Envy of the Rhymes

And the ratling Pit-pat-noise
Of the less Poetick Boys

When their Pot-Guns aim to hit
With their Pellets of small Wit

Parts of me ( they judg 'd ) decayed
But we last out , still unlayed

Please your Majesty to make
Of your Grace , for Goodness sake

Those your Fathers Marks , your Pounds
Let their Spite ( which now abounds

Then go on , and do its worst
This would all their Envy burst

And so warm the Poets Tongue
You'ld read a Snake , in his next Song

IF to my Mind , great Lord , I had a State
I would present you now with curious Plate

Of Noremberg , or Turky : Hang your Rooms
Not with the Arras , but the Persian Looms

I would , if Price , or Prayer could them get
Send in , what or Romano , Tintaret

Titian , or Raphael , Michael Angelo
Have left in Fame to equal , or out-go

The Old Greek Hands in Picture , or in Stone
This I would do , could I know Weston , one

Catch 'd with these Arts , wherein the Judge is wise
As far as Sense , and only by the Eyes

But you , I know , my Lord ; and know you can
Discern between a Statue and a Man

Can do the things that Statues do deserve
And act the business , which they paint , or carve

What you have studied , are the arts of Life
To compose Men , and Manners ; stint the strife

Of murmuring Subjects ; make the Nations know
What Worlds of Blessings to good Kings they owe

And mightiest Monarchs feel what large increase
Of Sweets , and Safeties , they possess by Peace

These I look up at with a reverend Eye
And strike Religion in the standers-by

Which though I can not , as an Architect
In glorious Piles , or Pyramids erect

Unto your Honour : I can tune in Song
Aloud : and ( happ'ly ) it may last as long

THo ' , happy Muse , thou know my Digby well
Yet read him in these lines : He doth excel

In Honour , Courtesie , and all the parts
Court can call hers , or Man could call his Arts

He 's Prudent , Valiant , Just , and Temperate
In him all Vertue is beheld in State

And he is built like some Imperial Room
For that to dwell in , and be still at home

His Breast is a brave Palace , a broad Street
Where all Heroick ample Thoughts do meet

Where Nature such a large Survey hath ta'en
As other Souls , to his , dwelt in a Lane

Witness his Action done at Scanderone
Upon my Birth-day , the Eleventh of June

When the Apostle Barnaby the Bright
Unto our year doth give the longest light

In sign the Subject , and the Song will live
Which I have vow 'd Posterity to give

Go , Muse , in , and salute him . Say he be
Busie , or frown at first ; when he sees thee

He will clear up his Forehead : think thou bringst
Good Omen to him , in the Note thou sing'st

For he doth love my Verses , and will look
Upon them , ( next to Spencer 's noble Book

And praise them too . O ! what a Fame 't will be
What Reputation to my Lines , and me

When he shall read them at the Treasurer 's Board
The knowing Weston , and that Learned Lord

Allows them ? Then , what Copies shall be had
What Transcripts begg 'd ? how cry 'd up , and how glad

Wilt thou be , Muse , when this shall them befall
Being sent to one , they will be read of all

To fit the Softness of our Years-Gift : When
We sing the best of Monarchs , Masters , Men

And offer your just Service on these Plains
Best Kings expect First : Fruits of your glad Gains

. P A N is the great Preserver of our bounds
. To him we owe all Profits of our Grounds

. Our Milk. . Our Fells. . Our Fleeces. . And first Lambs
. Our teeming Ewes. . And lusty mounting Rams

. See where he walks with M I R A by his side
Sound , sound his Praises loud , and with his , hers divide

. Where'er they tread th ' enamour 'd Ground
The fairest Flowers are always found

. As if the Beauties of the Year
Still waited on 'em where they were

. He is the Father of our Peace
. She , to the Crown , hath brought Increase

. We know no other Power than his
P A N only our great Shep'erd is

Our great , our good . Where one 's so drest
In truth of Colours , both are best

Haste , haste you hither , all you gentler Swains
That have a Flock , or Herd , upon these Plains

This is the great Preserver of our Bounds
To whom you owe all Duties of your Grounds

Your Milks , your Fells , your Fleeces , and first Lambs
Your teeming Ewes , as well as mounting Rams

Whose Praises let 's report unto the Woods
That they may take it echo 'd by the Floods

'T is he , 't is he , in singing he
And hunting , P A N , exceedeth thee

He gives all Plenty , and Increase
He is the Author of our Peace

Where'er he goes upon the Ground
The better Grass , and Flowers are found

To sweeter Pastures lead he can
Than ever P A L E S could , or P A N

He drives Diseases from our Folds
The Thief from Spoil his Presence holds

P A N knows no other Power than his
This only the great Shep'erd is

To take thy Phrygian Harp , and play
In honour of this cheerful Day

Long may they both contend to prove
That best of Crowns is such a love

When the benignest Stars do rise
And sweet Conjunctions grace the Skies

More than his Laws , and better led
By high Example , than by dread

Joy in IdÂÃ¦as of their own
And Kingdoms Hopes so timely sown

THat thou art lov 'd of God , this Work is done
Great King , thy having of a Second Son

And by thy blessing , may thy People see
How much they are belov 'd of God in thee

Would they would understand it ! Princes are
Great aids to Empire , as they are great care

To pious Parents , who would have their Blood
Should take first Seisin of the publick good

As hath thy J A M E S ; cleans 'd from Original Dross
This day , by Baptism , and his Saviour 's Cross

Grow up , sweet Babe , as blessed , in thy Name
As in renewing thy good Grandsires Fame

Me thought Great Britain in her Sea , before
Sate safe enough , but now secured more

At Land she triumphs in the triple shade
Her Rose , and Lily , intertwin 'd , have made

WHat gentle Ghost , besprent with April Dew
Hails me , so solemnly , to yonder Yew

And beck'ning wooes me , from the fatal Tree
To pluck a Garland , for her self or me

I do obey you , Beauty ! for in death
You seem a fair one ! O that you had breath

To give your shade a name ! Stay , stay , I feel
A horror in me ! all my Blood is Steel

Stiff ! stark ! my Joints 'gainst one another knock
Whose Daughter ? ha ? Great Savage of the Rock

He 's good , as great . I am almost a Stone
And e'er I can ask more of her she 's gone

Alas , I am all Marble ! write the rest
Thou wouldst have written , Fame , upon my Breast

It is a large fair Table , and a true
And the disposure will be something new

When I , who would the Poet have become
At least may bear th ' Inscription to her Tomb

She was the Lady Jane , and Marchioness
Of Winchester ; the Heralds can tell this

Earl River 's Grand-Child serve not forms , good Fame
Sound thou her Vertues , give her Soul a Name

Had I a thousand Mouths , as many Tongues
And Voice to raise them from my brazen Lungs

I durst not aim at that : The dotes were such
Thereof , no notion can express how much

Their Carract was ! I , or my Trump must break
But rather I , should I of that part speak

It is too near of kin to Heaven , the Soul
To be describ 'd ! Fames Fingers are too foul

To touch these Mysteries ! We may admire
The blaze , and splendor , but not handle fire

What she did here , by great example , well
T ' inlive Posterity , her Fame may tell

And , calling truth to witness , make that good
From the inherent Graces in her Blood

Else , who doth praise a Person by a new
But a fain 'd way , doth rob it of the true

Her Sweetness , Softness , her fair Courtesie
Her wary Guards , her wise Simplicity

Were like a Ring of Vertues , 'bout her set
And Piety the Center , where all met

A reverend State she had , an awful Eye
A dazling , yet inviting Majesty

What Nature , Fortune , Institution , Fact
Could summ to a perfection , was her Act

How did she leave the World ? with what contempt
Just as she in it liv 'd ! and so exempt

From all affection ! when they urg 'd the Cure
Of her Disease , how did her Soul assure

Her suff'rings , as the Body had been away
And to the Torturers ( her Doctors ) say

Stick on your Cupping-glasses , fear not , put
Your hottest Causticks to , burn , lance , or cut

'T is but a Body which you can torment
And I , into the World , all Soul was sent

Then comforted her Lord ! and blest her Son
Chear 'd her fair Sisters in her Race to run

With gladness temper 'd her sad Parents Tears
Made her Friends Joys , to get above their Fears

And , in her last act , taught the Standers-by
With admiration , and applause to die

Let Angels sing her glories , who did call
Her Spirit home , to her Original

Who saw the way was made it ! and were sent
To carry , and conduct the Complement

'Twixt death and life ! Where her Mortality
Became her Birth-day to Eternity

And now , through circumfused light , she looks
On Natures Secrets , there , as her own Books

Speaks Heavens Language ! and discovereth free
To every Order , ev'ry Hierarchy

Beholds her Maker ! and , in him , doth see
What the beginnings of all Beauties be

And all Beatitudes , that thence do flow
Which they that have the Crown are sure to know

Go now , her happy Parents , and be sad
If you not understand , what Child you had

If you dare grudge at Heaven , and repent
T ' have paid again a Blessing was but lent

And trusted so , as it deposited lay
At pleasure , to be call 'd for , every day

If you can envy your own Daughters bliss
And wish her state less happy than it is

If you can cast about your either Eye
And see all dead here , or about to die

The Stars , that are the Jewels of the Night
And Day , deceasing ! with the Prince of Light

The Sun ! great Kings ! and mightiest Kingdoms fall
Whole Nations ! nay Mankind ! the World , with all

That ever had beginning there , to 'ave end
With what injustice should one Soul pretend

T ' escape this common known necessity
When we were all born , we began to die

And , but for that contention , and brave strife
The Christian hath t ' enjoy the future life

He were the wretched'st of the Race of Men
But as he soars at that , he bruiseth then

The Serpents Head : Gets above Death , and Sin
And , sure of Heaven , rides triumphing in

FAir FAME , who art ordain 'd to crown
With ever-green , and great renown

Of Death , and Darkness ; and deprive
Their names of being kept alive

Of Goodness still : Vouchsafe to take
This CRADLE , and for Goodness sake

That all Posterity , as we
Who read what the CREPUNDIA be

For , though that Rattles , Timbrels , Toys
Take little Infants with their noise

Their Corals , Whistles , and prime Coats
Their painted Masks , their paper Boats

Yet , here are no such Trifles brought
No Cobweb Call 's ; no Surcoats wrought

But , here 's a Song of her DESCENT
And Call to the high Parliament

This , utter 'd by an ancient BARD
Who claims ( of reverence ) to be heard

Is sung : as als ' her getting up
By JACOB 's Ladder , to the top

SItting , and ready to be drawn
What makes these Velvets , Silks , and Lawn

Embroideries , Feathers , Fringes , Lace
Where every Limb takes like a Face

Send these suspected helps to aid
Some Form defective , or decayed

This Beauty , without falshood fair
Needs nought to cloath it but the Air

Yet something to the Painters view
Were fitly interpos 'd ; so new

He shall , if he can understand
Work with my fancy , his own Hand

Draw first a Cloud , all save her Neck
And , out of that , make Day to break

Till , like her Face , it do appear
And Men may think , all Light rose there

Then let the Beams of that disperse
The Cloud , and show the Universe

But at such distance , as the Eye
May rather yet adore , than spy

The Heaven design 'd , draw next a Spring
With all that Youth , or it can bring

Four Rivers branching forth like Seas
And Paradise confining these

Last , draw the circles of this Globe
And let there be a starry Robe

Of Constellations 'bout her horld
And thou hast painted Beauties World

But , Painter , see thou do not sell
A Copy of this Piece ; nor tell

Whose 't is : but if it favour find
Next sitting we will draw her Mind

PAinter yo ' are come , but may be gone
Now I have better thought thereon

This work I can perform alone
And give you reasons more than one

Not , that your Art I do refuse
But here I may no Colours use

Beside , your hand will never hit
To draw a thing that can not sit

You could make shift to paint an Eye
An Eagle tow'ring in the Sky

The Sun , a Sea , or soundless Pit
But these are like a Mind , not It

No , to express a Mind to sense
Would ask a Heavens Intelligence

Since nothing can report that flame
But what 's of kin to whence it came

Sweet Mind , then speak your self , and say
As you go on , by what brave way

Our sense you do with knowledge fill
And yet remain our wonder still

I call you Muse ; now make it true
Hence-forch'Hence-forth ' may every Line be you

That all may say , that see the Frame
This is no Picture , but the same

A Mind so pure , so perfect fine
As 't is not Radiant , but Divine

And so disdaining any trier
'T is got where it can try the Fire

There , high exalted in the Sphere
As it another Nature were

It moveth all ; and makes a flight
As circular , as infinite

Whose Notions when it will express
In speech ; it is with that excess

Of Grace , and Musick to the Ear
As what it spoke , it planted there

The Voice so sweet , the Words so fair
As some soft chime had strok 'd the Air

And , though the sound were parted thence
Still left an Echo in the sense

But , that a Mind so rapt , so high
So swift , so pure , should yet apply

It self to us , and come so nigh
Earths grossness ; there 's the how , and why

Is it because it sees us dull
And stuck in Clay here , it would pull

Us forth , by some Celestial slight
Up to her own sublimed hight

Or hath she here , upon the Ground
Some Paradise , or Palace found

In all the bounds of Beauty , fit
For her t ' inhabit ? There is it

Thrice happy House , that hast receipt
For this so lofty form , so streight

So polisht , perfect , round , and even
As it slid moulded off from Heaven

Not swelling like the Ocean proud
But stooping Gently , as a Cloud

As smooth as Oil pour 'd forth , and calm
As showers ; and sweet as drops of Balm

Smooth , soft , and sweet , in all a flood
Where it may run to any good

And where it stays , it there becomes
A nest of odorous Spice , and Gums

In action , winged as the Wind
In rest , like Spirits left behind

Upon a Bank , or Field of Flowers
Begotten by that Wind , and Showers

In thee , fair Mansion , let it rest
Yet know , with what thou art possest

Thou entertaining in thy Breast
But such a Mind , mak'st God thy Guest

BOast not these Titles of your Ancestors
( Brave Youths ) th ' are their possessions , none of yours

When your own Vertues , equall 'd have their Names
'Twill be but fair , to lean upon their Fames

For they are strong Supporters : But , till then
The greatest are but growing Gentlemen

It is a wretched thing to trust to Reeds
Which all Men do , that urge not their own deeds

Up to their Ancestors ; the Rivers side
By which yo ' are planted , shew 's your Fruit shall bide

Hang all your Rooms , with one large Pedigree
'T is Vertue alone , is true Nobility

Which Vertue from your Father , ripe , will fall
Study illustrious Him , and you have all

TWere time that I dy 'd too , now she is dead
Who was my Muse , and life of all I did

The Spirit that I wrote with , and conceived
All that was good , or great in me she weaved

And set it forth ; the rest were Cobwebs fine
Spun out in name of some of the old Nine

To hang a Window , or make dark the Room
Till swept away , th ' were cancell 'd with a Broom

Nothing , that could remain , or yet can stir
A sorrow in me , fit to wait to her

O ! had I seen her laid out a fair Course
By Death , on Earth , I should have had remorse

On Nature , for her : who did let her lie
And saw that portion of her self to die

Sleepy , or stupid Nature , couldst thou part
With such a Rarity , and not rouse Art

With all her aids , to save her from the seize
Of Vulture Death , and those relentless Cleys

Thou wouldst have lost the Ph â€œ Â© Â« nix , had the kind
Been trusted to thee : not to 't self assigned

Look on thy sloth , and give thy self undone
( For so thou art with me ) now she is gone

My wounded mind can not sustain this stroke
It rages , runs , flies , stands , and would provoke

The World to ruine with it ; in her Fall
I summ up mine own breaking , and wish all

Thou hast no more blows , Fate , to drive at one
What 's left a Poet , when his Muse is gone

Sure , I am dead , and know it not ! I feel
Nothing I do ; but , like a heavy Wheel

Am turned with anothers powers . My Passion
Whirls me about , and to blaspheme in fashion

I murmur against God , for having ta'en
Her blessed Soul , hence , forth this Valley vane

Of Tears , and Dungeon of Calamity
I envy it the Angels amity

The joy of Saints ! the Crown for which it lives
The glory , and gain of rest , which the place gives

Dare I prophane , so irreligious be
To 'greet , or grieve her soft Euthanasee

So sweetly taken to the Court of bliss
As Spirits had stol'n her Spirit , in a kiss

From off her Pillow , and deluded Bed
And left her lovely Body unthought dead

Indeed , she is not dead ! but laid to sleep
In Earth , till the last Trump awake the Sheep

And Goats together , whither they must come
To hear their Judge , and his eternal doom

To have that final retribution
Expected with the Fleshes restitution

For , as there are three Natures , Schoolmen call
One Corporal , only ; th ' other Spiritual

Like single ; so , there is a third , commixt
Of Body and Spirit together , plac 'd betwixt

Those other two ; which must be judg 'd , or crowned
This as it guilty is , or guiltless found

Must come to take a sentence , by the sense
Of that great Evidence , the Conscience

Who will be there , against that day prepared
T ' accuse , or quit all Parties to be heard

O Day of joy , and surety to the just
Who in that Feast of Resurrection trust

That great eternal Holy-day of rest
To Body , and Soul ! where Love is all the guest

And the whole Banquet is full fight'sight ' of God
Of joy the Circle , and sole Period

All other gladness , with the thought is barred
Hope , hath her end ! and Faith hath her reward

This being thus : why should my Tongue , or Pen
Presume to interpel that fulness , when

Nothing can more adorn it , than the Seat
That she is in , or , make it more compleat

Better be dumb , than superstitious
Who violates the God-head , is most vicious

Against the Nature he would worship . He
Will honour 'd be in all simplicity

Have all his actions , wondred at , and viewed
With silence , and amazement ! not with rude

Dull , and prophane , weak , and imperfect Eyes
Have busie search made in his mysteries

He knows , what work h ' hath done , to call this Guest
Out of her noble Body , to this Feast

And give her place , according to her Blood
Amongst her Peers , those Princes of all good

Saints , Martyrs , Prophets , with those Hierarchies
Angels , Arch-angels , Principalities

The Dominations , Vertues , and the Powers
The Thrones , the Cherub , and Seraphick Bowers

That , planted round , there sing before the Lamb
A new Song to his praise , and great I Am

And she doth know , out of the shade of Death
What 't is t ' enjoy , an everlasting Breath

To have her captiv 'd Spirit freed from Flesh
And on her Innocence , a Garment fresh

And white , as that : put on and in her hand
With Boughs of Palm , a crowned Victrice stand

And will you , worthy Son , Sir , knowing this
Put Black , and Mourning on ? and say you miss

A Wife , a Friend , a Lady , or a Love
Whom her Redeemer , honour 'd hath above

Her Fellows , with the Oyl of Gladness , bright
In HeavenHeaven 's Empire , and with a Robe of Light

Thither , you hope to come ; and there to find
That pure , that pretious , and exalted Mind

You once enjoy 'd : A short space severs yee
Compar 'd unto that long Eternity

That shall re-joyn ye . Was she , then , so dear
When she departed ? you will meet her there

Much more desir 'd , and dearer then before
By all the Wealth of Blessings , and the store

Accumulated on her , by the Lord
Of Life , and Light , the Son of God , the Word

There , all the happy Souls , that ever were
Shall meet with gladness in one Theatre

And each shall know , there , one anothers Face
By beatifick Vertue of the Place

There shall the Brother , with the Sister walk
And Sons , and Daughters , with their Parents talk

But all of God ; They still shall have to say
But make him All in All , their Theme , that Day

That happy Day , that never shall see night
Where He will be , all Beauty to the Sight

Wine , or delicious Fruits , unto the Taste
A Musick in the Ears , will ever last

Unto the Scent , a Spicery , or Balm
And to the Touch , a Flower , like soft as Palm

He will all Glory , all Perfection be
God , in the Union , and the Trinity

That Holy , Great , and Glorious Mystery
Will there revealed be in Majesty

By light , and comfort of Spiritual Grace
The Vision of our Saviour , Face to Face

In his Humanity ! To hear him preach
The price of our Redemption , and to teach

Through his inherent Righteousness , in death
The safety of our Souls , and forfeit Breath

What fulness of Beatitude is here
What Love with Mercy mixed doth appear

To stile us Friends , who were , by Nature , Foes
Adopt us Heirs , by Grace , who were of those

Had lost our selves ? and prodigally spent
Our native Portions , and possessed Rent

Yet have all Debts forgiven us , and advance
B ' imputed right to an Inheritance

In his Eternal Kingdom , where we sit
Equal with Angels , and Co-heirs of it

Nor dare we under Blasphemy conceive
He that shall be our Supreme Judge , should leave

Himself so un-inform 'd of his Elect
Who knows the Hearts of all , and can dissect

The smallest Fibre of our Flesh ; he can
Find all our Atoms from a Point t ' a Span

Our closest Creeks , and Corners , and can trace
Each Line , as it were graphick , in the Face

And best he knew her noble Character
For 't was himself who form 'd , and gave it her

And to that Form , lent two such Veins of Blood
As Nature could not more increase the Flood

Of Title in her ! All Nobility
( But Pride , that Schism of incivility

She had , and it became her ! she was fit
T ' have known no Envy , but by fuffring'suffring ' it

She had a Mind as calm , as she was fair
Not tost or troubled with light Lady-air

But , kept an even Gate , as some streight Tree
Mov 'd by the Wind , so comely moved she

And by the awful manage of her Eye
She swaid all Bus'ness in the Family

To one she said , Do this , he did it ; So
To another , Move ; he went ; To a third , Go

He run ; and all did strive with diligence
T ' obey , and serve her sweet Commandments

She was in one , a many parts of Life
A tender Mother , a discreeter Wife

A solemn Mistress , and so good a Friend
So Charitable , to religious End

In all her petite Actions , so devote
As her whole Life was now become one Note

Of Piety , and private Holiness
She spent more time in Tears her self to dress

For her Devotions , and those sad Essays
Of Sorrow , then all pomp of gaudy days

And came forth ever cheered , with the Rod
Of divine Comfort , when sh ' had talk 'd with God

Her broken Sighs did never miss whole Sense
Nor can the bruised Heart want Eloquence

For , Prayer is the Incense most perfumes
The Holy Altars , when it least presumes

And hers were all Humility ! they beat
The Door of Grace , and found the Mercy-Seat

In frequent speaking by the pious Psalms
Her solemn hours she spent , or giving Alms

Or doing other Deeds of Charity
To clothe the Naked , feed the Hungry . She

Would sit in an Infirmer , 'Infirmary ' whole days
Poring , as on a Map , to find the Ways

To that eternal Rest , where now sh ' hath Place
By sure Election , and predestin 'd Grace

She saw her Saviour , by an early light
Incarnate in the Manger , shining bright

On all the World ! She saw him on the Cross
Suffring , and dying to redeem our loss

She saw him rise , triumphing over Death
To justifie , and quicken us in Breath

She saw him too , in Glory to ascend
For his designed work the perfect end

Of raising , judging , and rewarding all
The kind of Man , on whom his Doom should fall

All this by Faith she saw , and fram 'd a Plea
In manner of a daily Apostrophe

To him should be her Judge , true God , true Man
Jesus , the only gotten Christ ! who can

As being Redeemer , and Repairer too
( Of lapsed Nature ) best know what to do

In that great Act of Judgment : Which the Father
Hath given wholly to the Son ( the rather

As being the Son of Man ) to shew his Power
His Wisdom , and his Justice , in that hour

The last of hours , and shutter up of all
Where first his Power will appear , by call

Of all are dead to Life ! His Wisdom show
In the discerning of each Conscience , so

And most his Justice , in the fitting Parts
And giving dues to all Mankinds Deserts

In this sweet Extasie , she was rapt hence
Who reads , will pardon my Intelligence

That thus have ventur 'd these true Strains upon
To publish her a Saint . My Muse is gone

HAppy is he , that from all Business clear
As the old Race of Mankind were

With his own Oxen tills his Sires left Lands
And is not in the Usurers Bands

Nor Soldier-like started with rough Alarms
Nor dreads the Seas inraged harms

But flees the Bar and Courts , with the proud bords
And waiting Chambers of great Lords

The Poplar tall , he then doth marrying twine
With the grown issue of the Vine

And with his Hook lops off the fruitless Race
And sets more happy in the Place

Or in the bending Vale beholds a-far
The lowing Herds there grazing are

Or the prest Honey in pure Pots doth keep
Of Earth , and shears the tender Sheep

Or when that Autumn , through the Fields lifts round
His Head , with mellow Apples crowned

How plucking Pears , his own hand grafted had
And Purple-matching Grapes , he 's glad

With which , Priapus , he may thank thy Hands
And , Sylvane , thine that keptst his Lands

Then now beneath some ancient Oak he may
Now in the rooted Grass him lay

Whilst from the higher Banks do slide the Floods
The soft Birds quarrel in the Woods

The Fountains murmur as the Streams do creep
And all invite to easie sleep

Then when the thundring Jove , his Snow and Showers
Are gathering by the Wintry hours

Or hence , or thence , he drives with many a Hound
Wild Boars into his Toils pitch 'd round

Or strains on his small Fork his subtil Nets
For th ' eating Thrush , or Pit-falls sets

And snares the fearful Hare , and new-come Crane
And 'counts them sweet Rewards so ta'en

Who ( amongst these delights ) would not forget
Loves cares so Evil , and so great

But if , to boot with these , a chaste Wife meet
For Houshold aid , and Children sweet

Such as the Sabines , or a Sun-burnt-blowse
Some lusty quick Apulians Spouse

To deck the hallow 'd Harth with old Wood fired
Against the Husband comes home tired

That penning the glad flock in Hurdles by
Their swelling Udders doth draw dry

And from the sweet Tub Wine of this year takes
And unbought Viands ready makes

Not Lucrine Oysters I could then more prize
Nor Turbot , nor bright Golden Eyes

If with bright Floods , the Winter troubled much
Into our Seas send any such

Th ' Ionian God-wit , nor the Ginny-hen
Could not go down my Belly then

More sweet than Olives , that new gather 'd be
From fattest Branches of the Tree

Or the Herb Sorrel , that loves Meadows still
Or Mallows loosing Bodies ill

Or at the Feast of Bounds , the Lamb then slain
Or Kid forc't from the Wolf again

Among these Cates how glad the sight doth come
Of the fed Flocks approaching home

To view the weary Oxen draw , with bare
And fainting Necks , the turned Share

The wealthy Houshold swarm of Bondmen met
And 'bout the steeming Chimney set

These thoughts when Usurer Alphius , now about
To turn more Farmer , had spoke out

'Gainst th ' Ides , his Moneys he gets in with pain
At th ' Calends puts all out again

VEnus , again thou mov'st a War
Long intermitted , pray thee , pray thee spare

I am not such , as in the Reign
Of the good Cynara I was : Refrain

Sowre Mother of sweet Loves , forbear
To bend a Man now at his fiftieth year

Too stubborn for Commands , so slack
Go where Youths soft Intreaties call thee back

More timely hie thee to the House
With thy bright Swans of Paulus Maximus

There jest , and feast , make him thine Host
If a fit Liver thou dost seek to toast

For he 's both Noble , lovely , young
And for the troubled Client fill's'files ' his Tongue

Child of a hundred Arts , and far
Will he display the Ensigns of thy War

And when he smiling finds his Grace
With thee 'bove all his Rivals Gifts take place

He will thee a Marble Statue make
Beneath a Sweet , wood Roof , neer Alba Lake

There shall thy dainty Nostril take
In many a Gum , and for thy soft Ears sake

Shall Verse be set to Harp and Lute
And Phrygian Hau'boy , not without the Flute

There twice a day in sacred Lays
The Youths and tender Maids shall sing thy praise

And in the Salian manner meet
Thrice 'bout thy Altar with their Ivory Feet

Me now , nor Wench , nor wanton Boy
Delights , nor credulous hope of mutual Joy

Nor care I now Healths to propound
Or with fresh Flowers to girt my Temple round

But , why , oh why , my Ligurine
Flow my thin Tears , down these pale Cheeks of mine

Or why , my well-grac 'd words among
With an uncomely silence fails my Tongue

Hard-hearted , I dream every Night
I hold thee fast ! but fled hence , with the Light

Whether in Mars his Field thou be
Or Tybers winding Streams , I follow thee

DOing , a filthy pleasure is , and short
And done , we straight repent us of the sport

Let us not then rush blindly on unto it
Like lustful Beasts , that only know to do it

For Lust will languish , and that Heat decay
But thus , thus , keeping endless Holy-day

Let us together closely lie , and kiss
There is no labour , nor no shame in this

This hath pleas 'd , doth please , and long will please ; never
Can this decay , but is beginning ever

You talk o ' better food for us , an ' schools , an ' fires , an ' all
We 'll wait for extry rations if you treat us rational

Do n't mess about the cook-room slops , but prove it to our face
The Widow 's Uniform is not the soldier-man 's disgrace

For it 's Tommy this , an ' Tommy that , an ' `` Chuck him out , the brute
But it 's `` Saviour of his country '' when the guns begin to shoot

An ' it 's Tommy this , an ' Tommy that , an ' anything you please
An ' Tommy ai n't a bloomin ' fool -- you bet that Tommy sees

An ' he played the cat an ' banjo with our forces
So here 's ~to~ you , Fuzzy-Wuzzy , at your home in the Soudan

You 're a pore benighted heathen but a first-class fightin ' man
We gives you your certificate , an ' if you want it signed

But man for man the Fuzzy knocked us holler
Then here 's ~to~ you , Fuzzy-Wuzzy , an ' the missis and the kid

Our orders was to break you , an ' of course we went an ' did
We sloshed you with Martinis , an ' it was n't hardly fair

Will last an healthy Tommy for a year
So here 's ~to~ you , Fuzzy-Wuzzy , an ' your friends which are no more

If we had n't lost some messmates we would help you to deplore
But give an ' take 's the gospel , an ' we 'll call the bargain fair

For a Regiment o ' British Infantree
So here 's ~to~ you , Fuzzy-Wuzzy , at your home in the Soudan

You 're a pore benighted heathen but a first-class fightin ' man
An ' here 's ~to~ you , Fuzzy-Wuzzy , with your hayrick head of hair

They was movin ' into action , they was needed very sore
To learn a little schoolin ' to a native army corps

They had nipped against an uphill , they was tuckin ' down the brow
When a tricky , trundlin ' roundshot give the knock to ~Snarleyow~

They cut him loose an ' left him -- he was almost tore in two
But he tried to follow after as a well-trained horse should do

HE went an ' fouled the limber , an ' the Driver 's Brother squeals
`` Pull up , pull up for ~Snarleyow~ -- his head 's between his heels

The Driver humped his shoulder , for the wheels was goin ' round
An ' there ai n't no `` Stop , conductor ! '' when a batt'ry 's changin ' ground

Sez he : `` I broke the beggar in , an ' very sad I feels
But I could n't pull up , not for ~you~ -- your head between your heels

HE had n't hardly spoke the word , before a droppin ' shell
A little right the batt'ry an ' between the sections fell

An ' when the smoke had cleared away , before the limber wheels
There lay the Driver 's Brother with his head between his heels

Then sez the Driver 's Brother , an ' his words was very plain
`` For Gawd 's own sake get over me , an ' put me out o ' pain

They saw his wounds was mortial , an ' they judged that it was best
So they took an ' drove the limber straight across his back an ' chest

The Driver he give nothin ' 'cept a little coughin ' grunt
But he swung his horses handsome when it came to `` Action Front

An ' if one wheel was juicy , you may lay your Monday head
'T was juicier for the niggers when the case begun to spread

The moril of this story , it is plainly to be seen
You hav n't got no families when servin ' of the Queen

You hav n't got no brothers , fathers , sisters , wives , or sons
If you want to win your battles take an ' work your bloomin ' guns

Down in the Infantry , nobody cares
Down in the Cavalry , Colonel he swears

But down in the lead with the wheel at the flog
Turns the bold Bombardier to a little whipped dog

There was a row in Silver Street that 's near to Dublin Quay
Between an Irish regiment an ' English cavalree

It started at Revelly an ' it lasted on till dark
The first man dropped at Harrison 's , the last forninst the Park

There was a row in Silver Street -- the regiments was out
They called us `` Delhi Rebels '' , an ' we answered `` Threes about

That drew them like a hornet 's nest -- we met them good an ' large
The English at the double an ' the Irish at the charge

There was a row in Silver Street -- an ' I was in it too
We passed the time o ' day , an ' then the belts went whirraru

I misremember what occurred , but subsequint the storm
A ~Freeman 's Journal Supplemint~ was all my uniform

There was a row in Silver Street -- they sent the Polis there
The English were too drunk to know , the Irish did n't care

But when they grew impertinint we simultaneous rose
Till half o ' them was Liffey mud an ' half was tatthered clothes

There was a row in Silver Street -- it might ha ' raged till now
But some one drew his side-arm clear , an ' nobody knew how

'T was Hogan took the point an ' dropped ; we saw the red blood run
An ' so we all was murderers that started out in fun

There was a row in Silver Street -- but that put down the shine
Wid each man whisperin ' to his next : `` 'T was never work o ' mine

We went away like beaten dogs , an ' down the street we bore him
The poor dumb corpse that could n't tell the bhoys were sorry for him

There was a row in Silver Street -- it is n't over yet
For half of us are under guard wid punishments to get

'T is all a merricle to me as in the Clink I lie
There was a row in Silver Street -- begod , I wonder why

By the old Moulmein Pagoda , lookin ' eastward to the sea
There 's a Burma girl a-settin ' , and I know she thinks o ' me

For the wind is in the palm-trees , and the temple-bells they say
`` Come you back , you British soldier ; come you back to Mandalay

HEr petticoat was yaller an ' her little cap was green
An ' her name was Supi-yaw-lat -- jes ' the same as Theebaw 's Queen

An ' I seed her first a-smokin ' of a whackin ' white cheroot
An ' a-wastin ' Christian kisses on an heathen idol 's foot

When the mist was on the rice-fields an ' the sun was droppin ' slow
She 'd git her little banjo an ' she 'd sing `` ~Kulla-lo-lo ! ~

With her arm upon my shoulder an ' her cheek agin ' my cheek
We useter watch the steamers an ' the ~hathis~ pilin ' teak

But that 's all shove behind me -- long ago an ' fur away
An ' there ai n't no 'busses runnin ' from the Bank to Mandalay

An ' I 'm learnin ' here in London what the ten-year soldier tells
`` If you 've heard the East a-callin ' , you wo n't never heed naught else

I am sick o ' wastin ' leather on these gritty pavin'-stones
An ' the blasted Henglish drizzle wakes the fever in my bones

Tho ' I walks with fifty housemaids outer Chelsea to the Strand
An ' they talks a lot o ' lovin ' , but wot do they understand

Ship me somewheres east of Suez , where the best is like the worst
Where there are n't no Ten Commandments an ' a man can raise a thirst

For the temple-bells are callin ' , an ' it 's there that I would be
By the old Moulmein Pagoda , looking lazy at the sea

OH , East is East , and West is West , and never the twain shall meet
Till Earth and Sky stand presently at GodÃ•s great Judgment Seat

But there is neither East nor West , Border , nor Breed , nor Birth
When two strong men stand face to face , thoÃ• they come from the ends of the earth

Kamal is out with twenty men to raise the Border-side
And he has lifted the Colonel 's mare that is the Colonel 's pride

He has lifted her out of the stable-door between the dawn and the day
And turned the calkins upon her feet , and ridden her far away

Then up and spoke the Colonel 's son that led a troop of the Guides
`` Is there never a man of all my men can say where Kamal hides

Then up and spoke Mahommed Khan , the son of the Ressaldar
`` If ye know the track of the morning-mist , ye know where his pickets are

At dusk he harries the Abazai -- at dawn he is into Bonair
But he must go by Fort Bukloh to his own place to fare

So if ye gallop to Fort Bukloh as fast as a bird can fly
By the favour of God ye may cut him off ere he win to the Tongue of Jagai

But if he be past the Tongue of Jagai , right swiftly turn ye then
For the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with Kamal 's men

There is rock to the left , and rock to the right , and low lean thorn between
And ye may hear a breech-bolt snick where never a man is seen

The Colonel 's son has taken a horse , and a raw rough dun was he
With the mouth of a bell and the heart of Hell and the head of the gallows-tree

The Colonel 's son to the Fort has won , they bid him stay to eat
Who rides at the tail of a Border thief , he sits not long at his meat

He 's up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as he can fly
Till he was aware of his father 's mare in the gut of the Tongue of Jagai

Till he was aware of his father 's mare with Kamal upon her back
And when he could spy the white of her eye , he made the pistol crack

He has fired once , he has fired twice , but the whistling ball went wide
`` Ye shoot like a soldier , '' Kamal said . `` Show now if ye can ride

It 's up and over the Tongue of Jagai , as blown dustdevils go
The dun he fled like a stag of ten , but the mare like a barren doe

The dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above
But the red mare played with the snaffle-bars , as a maiden plays with a glove

There was rock to the left and rock to the right , and low lean thorn between
And thrice he heard a breech-bolt snick tho ' never a man was seen

They have ridden the low moon out of the sky , their hoofs drum up the dawn
The dun he went like a wounded bull , but the mare like a new-roused fawn

The dun he fell at a water-course -- in a woful heap fell he
And Kamal has turned the red mare back , and pulled the rider free

He has knocked the pistol out of his hand -- small room was there to strive
`` 'T was only by favour of mine , '' quoth he , `` ye rode so long alive

There was not a rock for twenty mile , there was not a clump of tree
But covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee

If I had raised my bridle-hand , as I have held it low
The little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row

If I had bowed my head on my breast , as I have held it high
The kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly

Lightly answered the Colonel 's son : `` Do good to bird and beast
But count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast

If there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away
Belike the price of a jackal 's meal were more than a thief could pay

They will feed their horse on the standing crop , their men on the garnered grain
The thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are slain

But if thou thinkest the price be fair , -- thy brethren wait to sup
The hound is kin to the jackal-spawn , -- howl , dog , and call them up

And if thou thinkest the price be high , in steer and gear and stack
Give me my father 's mare again , and I 'll fight my own way back

Kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet
`` No talk shall be of dogs , '' said he , `` when wolf and gray wolf meet

May I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath
What dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with Death

Lightly answered the Colonel 's son : `` I hold by the blood of my clan
Take up the mare for my father 's gift -- by God , she has carried a man

The red mare ran to the Colonel 's son , and nuzzled against his breast
`` We be two strong men , '' said Kamal then , `` but she loveth the younger best

So she shall go with a lifter 's dower , my turquoise-studded rein
My broidered saddle and saddle-cloth , and silver stirrups twain

The Colonel 's son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-end
`` Ye have taken the one from a foe , '' said he ; `` will ye take the mate from a friend

`` A gift for a gift , '' said Kamal straight ; `` a limb for the risk of a limb
Thy father has sent his son to me , I 'll send my son to him

With that he whistled his only son , that dropped from a mountain-crest
He trod the ling like a buck in spring , and he looked like a lance in rest

`` Now here is thy master , '' Kamal said , `` who leads a troop of the Guides
And thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides

Till Death or I cut loose the tie , at camp and board and bed
Thy life is his -- thy fate it is to guard him with thy head

So , thou must eat the White Queen 's meat , and all her foes are thine
And thou must harry thy father 's hold for the peace of the Border-line

And thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power
Belike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur

They have looked each other between the eyes , and there they found no fault
They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on leavened bread and salt

They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on fire and fresh-cut sod
On the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife , and the Wondrous Names of God

The Colonel 's son he rides the mare and Kamal 's boy the dun
And two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but one

And when they drew to the Quarter-Guard , full twenty swords flew clear
There was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer

`` Ha ' done ! ha ' done ! '' said the Colonel 's son . `` Put up the steel at your sides
Last night ye had struck at a Border thief -- to-night 't is a man of the Guides

Oh , East is East , and West is West , and never the twain shall meet
Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God 's great Judgment Seat

But there is neither East nor West , Border , nor Breed , nor Birth
When two strong men stand face to face , tho ' they come from the ends of the earth

All night we heard the death-gongs ring
For the soul of the dying Rajpoot King

All night the cressets glimmered pale
On Ulwar sabre and Tonk jezail

And there was sobbing behind the screen
Rustle and whisper of women unseen

From the Malwa plains to the Abu scars
And wail upon wail went up to the stars

The Boondi Queen beneath us cried
`` See , now , that we die as our mothers died

But ere the rush of the unseen feet
Had reached the turn to the open street

`` Oh ] /e , they mourn here : let me by
Azizun , the Lucknow nautch-girl , I

Guard them safely , but let me go
Or ever they pay the debt they owe

That he prayed to a flat-nosed Lucknow god
And kissed the ground where her feet had trod

Where the gray apes swing , and the peacocks preen
On fretted pillar and jewelled screen

`` Friend of the English , free from fear
Baron of Luni to Jeysulmeer

And out of a shattered temple crept
A woman who veiled her head and wept

When thrice she leaped from the leaping flame
And thrice she beat her breast for shame

Who had stood by the King in sport and fray
To blade in ambush or boar at bay

Who held the King and all his land
To the wanton will of a harlot 's hand

I had hoped to clear ere the fire died
And lay me down by my master 's side

Yet if I may pray a Rajpoot lord
To sully the steel of a Thakur 's sword

`` I had looked for the Queen to face the flame
But the harlot dies for the Rajpoot dame

Red as slaughter and blue as steel
That whistled and fluttered from head to heel

Before the old Peshawur Gate , where Kurd and Kaffir meet
The Governor of Kabul dealt the Justice of the Street

And that was strait as running noose and swift as plunging knife
Tho ' he who held the longer purse might hold the longer life

There was a hound of Hindustan had struck a Euzufzai
Wherefore they spat upon his face and led him out to die

It chanced the King went forth that hour when throat was bared to knife
The Kaffir grovelled under-hoof and clamoured for his life

Then said the King : `` Have hope , O friend ! Yea , Death disgraced is hard
Much honour shall be thine '' ; and called the Captain of the Guard

Yar Khan , a bastard of the Blood , so city-babble saith
And he was honoured of the King -- the which is salt to Death

And he was son of Daoud Shah , the Reiver of the Plains
And blood of old Durani Lords ran fire in his veins

And 't was to tame an Afghan pride nor Hell nor Heaven could bind
The King would make him butcher to a yelping cur of Hind

`` Strike ! '' said the King . `` King 's blood art thou -- his death shall be his pride
Then louder , that the crowd might catch : `` Fear not -- his arms are tied

Yar Khan drew clear the Khyber knife , and struck , and sheathed again
`` O man , thy will is done , '' quoth he ; `` a King this dog hath slain

Abdhur Rahman , the Durani Chief , to the North and the South is sold
The North and the South shall open their mouth to a Ghilzai flag unrolled

When the big guns speak to the Khyber peak , and his dog-Heratis fly
Ye have heard the song -- How long ? How long ? Wolves of the Abazai

That night before the watch was set , when all the streets were clear
The Governor of Kabul spoke : `` My King , hast thou no fear

Thou knowest -- thou hast heard , '' -- his speech died at his master 's face
And grimly said the Afghan King : `` I rule the Afghan race

My path is mine -- see thou to thine -- to-night upon thy bed
Think who there be in Kabul now that clamour for thy head

That night when all the gates were shut to City and to throne
Within a little garden-house the King lay down alone

Before the sinking of the moon , which is the Night of Night
Yar Khan came softly to the King to make his honour white

The children of the town had mocked beneath his horse 's hoofs
The harlots of the town had hailed him `` butcher ! '' from their roofs

But as he groped against the wall , two hands upon him fell
The King behind his shoulder spake : `` Dead man , thou dost not well

'T is ill to jest with Kings by day and seek a boon by night
And that thou bearest in thy hand is all too sharp to write

But three days hence , if God be good , and if thy strength remain
Thou shalt demand one boon of me and bless me in thy pain

For I am merciful to all , and most of all to thee
My butcher of the shambles , rest -- no knife hast thou for me

Abdhur Rahman , the Durani Chief , holds hard by the South and the North
But the Ghilzai knows , ere the melting snows , when the swollen banks break forth

When the red-coats crawl to the sungar wall , and his Usbeg lances fail
Ye have heard the song -- How long ? How long ? Wolves of the Zuka Kheyl

They stoned him in the rubbish-field when dawn was in the sky
According to the written word , `` See that he do not die

They stoned him till the stones were piled above him on the plain
And those the labouring limbs displaced they tumbled back again

One watched beside the dreary mound that veiled the battered thing
And him the King with laughter called the Herald of the King

It was upon the second night , the night of Ramazan
The watcher leaning earthward heard the message of Yar Khan

From shattered breast through shrivelled lips broke forth the rattling breath
`` Creature of God , deliver me from agony of Death

They sought the King among his girls , and risked their lives thereby
`` Protector of the Pitiful , give orders that he die

`` Bid him endure until the day , '' a lagging answer came
`` The night is short , and he can pray and learn to bless my name

Before the dawn three times he spoke , and on the day once more
`` Creature of God , deliver me , and bless the King therefor

They shot him at the morning prayer , to ease him of his pain
And when he heard the matchlocks clink , he blessed the King again

Which thing the singers made a song for all the world to sing
So that the Outer Seas may know the mercy of the King

When spring-time flushes the desert grass
Our kafilas wind through the Khyber Pass

Lean are the camels but fat the frails
Light are the purses but heavy the bales

As the snowbound trade of the North comes down
To the market-square of Peshawur town

In a turquoise twilight , crisp and chill
A kafila camped at the foot of the hill

Then blue smoke-haze of the cooking rose
And tent-peg answered to hammer-nose

And the picketed ponies , shag and wild
Strained at their ropes as the feed was piled

And the bubbling camels beside the load
Sprawled for a furlong adown the road

And the Persian pussy-cats , brought for sale
Spat at the dogs from the camel-bale

And the tribesmen bellowed to hasten the food
And the camp-fires twinkled by Fort Jumrood

And there fled on the wings of the gathering dusk
A savour of camels and carpets and musk

A murmur of voices , a reek of smoke
To tell us the trade of the Khyber woke

The lid of the flesh-pot chattered high
The knives were whetted and -- then came I

To Mahbub Ali the muleteer
Patching his bridles and counting his gear

But Mahbub Ali the kindly said
`` Better is speech when the belly is fed

So we plunged the hand to the mid-wrist deep
In a cinnamon stew of the fat-tailed sheep

And he who never hath tasted the food
By Allah ! he knoweth not bad from good

We cleansed our beards of the mutton-grease
We lay on the mats and were filled with peace

And the talk slid north , and the talk slid south
With the sliding puffs from the hookah-mouth

Four things greater than all things are
Women and Horses and Power and War

We spake of them all , but the last the most
For I sought a word of a Russian post

Of a shifty promise , an unsheathed sword
And a gray-coat guard on the Helmund ford

Then Mahbub Ali lowered his eyes
In the fashion of one who is weaving lies

Quoth he : `` Of the Russians who can say
When the night is gathering all is gray

But we look that the gloom of the night shall die
In the morning flush of a blood-red sky

Friend of my heart , is it meet or wise
To warn a King of his enemies

We know what Heaven or Hell may bring
But no man knoweth the mind of the King

That unsought counsel is cursed of God
Attesteth the story of Wali Dad

`` His sire was leaky of tongue and pen
His dam was a clucking Khuttuck hen

And the colt bred close to the vice of each
For he carried the curse of an unstanched speech

Therewith madness -- so that he sought
The favour of kings at the Kabul court

And travelled , in hope of honour , far
To the line where the gray-coat squadrons are

There have I journeyed too -- but I
Saw naught , said naught , and -- did not die

He harked to rumour , and snatched at a breath
Of ` this one knoweth ' and ` that one saith

Legends that ran from mouth to mouth
Of a gray-coat coming , and sack of the South

These have I also heard -- they pass
With each new spring and the winter grass

`` Hot-foot southward , forgotten of God
Back to the city ran Wali Dad

Even to Kabul -- in full durbar
The King held talk with his Chief in War

Into the press of the crowd he broke
And what he had heard of the coming spoke

`` Then Gholam Hyder , the Red Chief , smiled
As a mother might on a babbling child

But those who would laugh restrained their breath
When the face of the King showed dark as death

Evil it is in full durbar
To cry to a ruler of gathering war

Slowly he led to a peach-tree small
That grew by a cleft of the city wall

And he said to the boy : ` They shall praise thy zeal
So long as the red spurt follows the steel

And the Russ is upon us even now
Great is thy prudence -- await them , thou

Watch from the tree . Thou art young and strong
Surely thy vigil is not for long

The Russ is upon us , thy clamour ran
Surely an hour shall bring their van

Wait and watch . When the host is near
Shout aloud that my men may hear

`` Friend of my heart , is it meet or wise
To warn a King of his enemies

A guard was set that he might not flee
A score of bayonets ringed the tree

The peach-bloom fell in showers of snow
When he shook at his death as he looked below

By the power of God , who alone is great
Till the seventh day he fought with his fate

Then madness took him , and men declare
He mowed in the branches as ape and bear

And last as a sloth , ere his body failed
And he hung as a bat in the forks , and wailed

And sleep the cord of his hands untied
And he fell , and was caught on the points and died

`` Heart of my heart , is it meet or wise
To warn a King of his enemies

We know what Heaven or Hell may bring
But no man knoweth the mind of the King

Of the gray-coat coming who can say
When the night is gathering all is gray

Two things greater than all things are
The first is Love , and the second War

And since we know not how War may prove
Heart of my heart , let us talk of Love

And Captain O'Neil of the Black Tyrone
Was blessed with a slug in the ulnar-bone

( Now a slug that is hammered from telegraph-wire
Is a thorn in the flesh and a rankling fire

. . . At the close of a winter day
Their anchors down , by London town , the Three Great Captains lay

And one was Admiral of the North from Solway Firth to Skye
And one was Lord of the Wessex coast and all the lands thereby

And one was Master of the Thames from Limehouse to Blackwall
And he was Captain of the Fleet -- the bravest of them all

Their good guns guarded their great gray sides that were thirty foot in the sheer
When there came a certain trading-brig with news of a privateer

Her rigging was rough with the clotted drift that drives in a Northern breeze
Her sides were clogged with the lazy weed that spawns in the Eastern seas

Light she rode in the rude tide-rip , to left and right she rolled
And the skipper sat on the scuttle-butt and stared at an empty hold

`` I ha ' paid Port dues for your Law , '' quoth he , `` and where is the Law ye boast
If I sail unscathed from a heathen port to be robbed on a Christian coast

Ye have smoked the hives of the Laccadives as we burn the lice in a bunk
We tack not now to a Gallang prow or a plunging Pei-ho junk

I had no fear but the seas were clear as far as a sail might fare
Till I met with a lime-washed Yankee brig that rode off Finisterre

There were canvas blinds to his bow-gun ports to screen the weight he bore
And the signals ran for a merchantman from Sandy Hook to the Nore

He would not fly the Rovers ' flag -- the bloody or the black
But now he floated the Gridiron and now he flaunted the Jack

He spoke of the Law as he crimped my crew -- he swore it was only a loan
But when I would ask for my own again , he swore it was none of my own

He has taken my little parrakeets that nest beneath the Line
He has stripped my rails of the shaddock-frails and the green unripened pine

He has taken my bale of dammer and spice I won beyond the seas
He has taken my grinning heathen gods -- and what should he want o ' these

My foremast would not mend his boom , my deckhouse patch his boats
He has whittled the two , this Yank Yahoo , to peddle for shoe-peg oats

I could not fight for the failing light and a rough beam-sea beside
But I hulled him once for a clumsy crimp and twice because he lied

Had I had guns ( as I had goods ) to work my Christian harm
I had run him up from his quarter-deck to trade with his own yard-arm

I had nailed his ears to my capstan-head , and ripped them off with a saw
And soused them in the bilgewater , and served them to him raw

I had flung him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rocking dark
I had towed him aft of his own craft , a bait for his brother shark

I had lapped him round with cocoa husk , and drenched him with the oil
And lashed him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoil

I had stripped his hide for my hammock-side , and tasselled his beard i ' the mesh
And spitted his crew on the live bamboo that grows through the gangrened flesh

I had hove him down by the mangroves brown , where the mud-reef sucks and draws
Moored by the heel to his own keel to wait for the land-crab 's claws

He is lazar within and lime without , ye can nose him far enow
For he carries the taint of a musky ship -- the reek of the slaver 's dhow

The skipper looked at the tiering guns and the bulwarks tall and cold
And the Captains Three full courteously peered down at the gutted hold

And the Captains Three called courteously from deck to scuttle-butt
`` Good Sir , we ha ' dealt with that merchantman or ever your teeth were cut

Your words be words of a lawless race , and the Law it standeth thus
He comes of a race that have never a Law , and he never has boarded us

We ha ' sold him canvas and rope and spar -- we know that his price is fair
And we know that he weeps for the lack of a Law as he rides off Finisterre

And since he is damned for a gallows-thief by you and better than you
We hold it meet that the English fleet should know that we hold him true

The skipper called to the tall taffrail : -- `` And what is that to me
Did ever you hear of a Yankee brig that rifled a Seventy-three

Do I loom so large from your quarter-deck that I lift like a ship o ' the Line
He has learned to run from a shotted gun and harry such craft as mine

There is never a Law on the Cocos Keys to hold a white man in
But we do not steal the niggers ' meal , for that is a nigger 's sin

Must he have his Law as a quid to chaw , or laid in brass on his wheel
Does he steal with tears when he buccaneers ? 'Fore Gad , then , why does he steal

The skipper bit on a deep-sea word , and the word it was not sweet
For he could see the Captains Three had signalled to the Fleet

But three and two , in white and blue , the whimpering flags began
`` We have heard a tale of a -- foreign sail , but he is a merchantman

The skipper peered beneath his palm and swore by the Great Horn Spoon
`` 'Fore Gad , the Chaplain of the Fleet would bless my picaroon

By two and three the flags blew free to lash the laughing air
`` We have sold our spars to the merchantman -- we know that his price is fair

The skipper winked his Western eye , and swore by a China storm
`` They ha ' rigged him a Joseph 's jury-coat to keep his honour warm

The halliards twanged against the tops , the bunting bellied broad
The skipper spat in the empty hold and mourned for a wasted cord

Masthead -- masthead , the signal sped by the line o ' the British craft
The skipper called to his Lascar crew , and put her about and laughed

`` It 's mainsail haul , my bully boys all -- we 'll out to the seas again
Ere they set us to paint their pirate saint , or scrub at his grapnel-chain

It 's fore-sheet free , with her head to the sea , and the swing of the unbought brine
We 'll make no sport in an English court till we come as a ship o ' the Line

Till we come as a ship o ' the Line , my lads , of thirty foot in the sheer
Lifting again from the outer main with news of a privateer

Flying his pluck at our mizzen-truck for weft of Admiralty
Heaving his head for our dipsey-lead in sign that we keep the sea

Then fore-sheet home as she lifts to the foam -- we stand on the outward tack
We are paid in the coin of the white man 's trade the bezant is hard , ay , and black

The frigate-bird shall carry my word to the Kling and the Orang-Laut
How a man may sail from a heathen coast to be robbed in a Christian port

How a man may be robbed in Christian port while Three Great Captains there
Shall dip their flag to a slaver 's rag -- to show that his trade is fair

Wherefore she kept her hatches close
When the merry Channel chops arose

They dipped their noses deep in the sea
They racked their stays and stanchions free

That carried the dainty Hotchkiss gun
And a pair o ' heels wherewith to run

And once she fired and twice she fired
Till the bow-gun drooped like a lily tired

'Twere well to rest for an hour or twain
And botch the shattered plates again

And the great stern-gun shot fair and true
With the heave of the ship , to the stainless blue

You can hear the hiss of the helpless ram
You can hear the twisted runners jam

Swung round to take the cruiser 's fire
As the White Whale faces the Thresher 's ire

And it is not meet for English stock
To bide in the heart of an eight-day clock

We dare not ram , for she can run
And dare ye fire another gun

But fifty feet at stern and bow
Lay bare as the paunch of the purser 's sow

We have emptied the bunkers in open sea
Their shrapnel bursts where our coal should be

Her two dumb guns glared south and north
And the blood and the bubbling steam ran forth

And he answered , `` Grapple her stern and bow
They have asked for the steel . They shall have it now

And the scalded stokers yelped delight
As they rolled in the waist and heard the fight

They fought as they fought in Nelson 's fleet
They were stripped to the waist , they were bare to the feet

And carried a million pounds in steel
To the cod and the corpse-fed conger-eel

On a cruiser won from an ancient foe
As it was in the days of long ago

Trailing like a wounded duck , working out her soul
Clanging like a smithy-shop after every roll

Just a funnel and a mast lurching through the spray
So we threshed the ~Bolivar~ out across the Bay

Banged against the iron decks , bilges choked with coal
Flayed and frozen foot and hand , sick of heart and soul

Last we prayed she 'd buck herself into judgment Day
Hi ! we cursed the ~Bolivar~ knocking round the Bay

Aching for an hour 's sleep , dozing off between
'Heard the rotten rivets draw when she took it green

'Watched the compass chase its tail like a cat at play
That was on the ~Bolivar~ , south across the Bay

Then a grayback cleared us out , then the skipper laughed
`` Boys , the wheel has gone to Hell -- rig the winches aft

Yoke the kicking rudder-head -- get her under way
So we steered her , pulley-haul , out across the Bay

Just a pack o ' rotten plates puttied up with tar
In we came , an ' time enough , 'cross Bilbao Bar

Overloaded , undermanned , meant to founder , we
Euchred God Almighty 's storm , bluffed the Eternal Sea

Seven men from all the world , back to town again
Rollin ' down the Ratcliffe Road drunk and raising Cain

Seven men from out of Hell . Ai n't the owners gay
'Cause we took the `` Bolivar '' safe across the Bay

Love and Death once ceased their strife
At the Tavern of Man 's Life

Called for wine , and threw -- alas
Each his quiver on the grass

When the bout was o'er they found
Mingled arrows strewed the ground

Hastily they gathered then
Each the loves and lives of men

Ah , the fateful dawn deceived
Mingled arrows each one sheaved

Death 's dread armoury was stored
With the shafts he most abhorred

Love 's light quiver groaned beneath
Venom-headed darts of Death

Thus it was they wrought our woe
At the Tavern long ago

Loosing blindly as they fly
Old men love while young men die

When the flush of a new-born sun fell first on Eden 's green and gold
Our father Adam sat under the Tree and scratched with a stick in the mould

And the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy to his mighty heart
Till the Devil whispered behind the leaves , `` It 's pretty , but is it Art

Wherefore he called to his wife , and fled to fashion his work anew
The first of his race who cared a fig for the first , most dread review

And he left his lore to the use of his sons -- and that was a glorious gain
When the Devil chuckled `` Is it Art ? '' in the ear of the branded Cain

They fought and they talked in the North and the South , they talked and they fought in the West
Till the waters rose on the pitiful land , and the poor Red Clay had rest

Had rest till that dank blank-canvas dawn when the dove was preened to start
And the Devil bubbled below the keel : `` It 's human , but is it Art

They builded a tower to shiver the sky and wrench the stars apart
Till the Devil grunted behind the bricks : `` It 's striking , but is it Art

The stone was dropped at the quarry-side and the idle derrick swung
While each man talked of the aims of Art , and each in an alien tongue

The tale is as old as the Eden Tree -- and new as the new-cut tooth
For each man knows ere his lip-thatch grows he is master of Art and Truth

And each man hears as the twilight nears , to the beat of his dying heart
The Devil drum on the darkened pane : `` You did it , but was it Art

We have learned to whittle the Eden Tree to the shape of a surplice-peg
We have learned to bottle our parents twain in the yelk of an addled egg

We know that the tail must wag the dog , for the horse is drawn by the cart
But the Devil whoops , as he whooped of old : `` It 's clever , but is it Art

When the flicker of London sun falls faint on the Club-room 's green and gold
The sons of Adam sit them down and scratch with their pens in the mould

They scratch with their pens in the mould of their graves , and the ink and the anguish start
For the Devil mutters behind the leaves : `` It 's pretty , but is it Art

Now , if we could win to the Eden Tree where the Four Great Rivers flow
And the Wreath of Eve is red on the turf as she left it long ago

And if we could come when the sentry slept and softly scurry through
By the favour of God we might know as much -- as our father Adam knew

Winds of the World , give answer ! They are whimpering to and fro
And what should they know of England who only England know

The poor little street-bred people that vapour and fume and brag
They are lifting their heads in the stillness to yelp at the English Flag

Must we borrow a clout from the Boer -- to plaster anew with dirt
An Irish liar 's bandage , or an English coward 's shirt

We may not speak of England ; her Flag 's to sell or share
What is the Flag of England ? Winds of the World , declare

The North Wind blew : -- `` From Bergen my steel-shod vanguards go
I chase your lazy whalers home from the Disko floe

By the great North Lights above me I work the will of God
And the liner splits on the ice-field or the Dogger fills with cod

`` I barred my gates with iron , I shuttered my doors with flame
Because to force my ramparts your nutshell navies came

I took the sun from their presence , I cut them down with my blast
And they died , but the Flag of England blew free ere the spirit passed

`` The lean white bear hath seen it in the long , long Arctic night
The musk-ox knows the standard that flouts the Northern Light

What is the Flag of England ? Ye have but my bergs to dare
Ye have but my drifts to conquer . Go forth , for it is there

The South Wind sighed : -- `` From the Virgins my mid-sea course was ta'en
Over a thousand islands lost in an idle main

Where the sea-egg flames on the coral and the long-backed breakers croon
Their endless ocean legends to the lazy , locked lagoon

`` Strayed amid lonely islets , mazed amid outer keys
I waked the palms to laughter -- I tossed the scud in the breeze

Never was isle so little , never was sea so lone
But over the scud and the palm-trees an English flag was flown

`` I have wrenched it free from the halliard to hang for a wisp on the Horn
I have chased it north to the Lizard -- ribboned and rolled and torn

I have spread its fold o'er the dying , adrift in a hopeless sea
I have hurled it swift on the slaver , and seen the slave set free

`` My basking sunfish know it , and wheeling albatross
Where the lone wave fills with fire beneath the Southern Cross

What is the Flag of England ? Ye have but my reefs to dare
Ye have but my seas to furrow . Go forth , for it is there

The East Wind roared : -- `` From the Kuriles , the Bitter Seas , I come
And me men call the Home-Wind , for I bring the English home

Look -- look well to your shipping ! By the breath of my mad typhoon
I swept your close-packed Praya and beached your best at Kowloon

`` The reeling junks behind me and the racing seas before
I raped your richest roadstead -- I plundered Singapore

I set my hand on the Hoogli ; as a hooded snake she rose
And I flung your stoutest steamers to roost with the startled crows

`` Never the lotus closes , never the wild-fowl wake
But a soul goes out on the East Wind that died for England 's sake

Man or woman or suckling , mother or bride or maid
Because on the bones of the English the English Flag is stayed

`` The desert-dust hath dimmed it , the flying wild-ass knows
The scared white leopard winds it across the taintless snows

What is the Flag of England ? Ye have but my sun to dare
Ye have but my sands to travel . Go forth , for it is there

The West Wind called : -- `` In squadrons the thoughtless galleons fly
That bear the wheat and cattle lest street-bred people die

They make my might their porter , they make my house their path
Till I loose my neck from their rudder and whelm them all in my wrath

`` I draw the gliding fog-bank as a snake is drawn from the hole
They bellow one to the other , the frighted ship-bells toll

For day is a drifting terror till I raise the shroud with my breath
And they see strange bows above them and the two go locked to death

`` But whether in calm or wrack-wreath , whether by dark or day
I heave them whole to the conger or rip their plates away

First of the scattered legions , under a shrieking sky
Dipping between the rollers , the English Flag goes by

`` The dead dumb fog hath wrapped it -- the frozen dews have kissed
The naked stars have seen it , a fellow-star in the mist

What is the Flag of England ? Ye have but my breath to dare
Ye have but my waves to conquer . Go forth , for it is there

Help for a patriot distressed , a spotless spirit hurt
Help for an honourable clan sore trampled in the dirt

From Queenstown Bay to Donegal , O listen to my song
The honourable gentlemen have suffered grievous wrong

Their noble names were mentioned -- O the burning black disgrace
By a brutal Saxon paper in an Irish shooting-case

They sat upon it for a year , then steeled their heart to brave it
And `` coruscating innocence '' the learned Judges gave it

Bear witness , Heaven , of that grim crime beneath the surgeon 's knife
The honourable gentlemen deplored the loss of life

Bear witness of those chanting choirs that burk and shirk and snigger
No man laid hand upon the knife or finger to the trigger

Cleared in the face of all mankind beneath the winking skies
Like ph ] oenixes from Ph ] oenix Park ( and what lay there ) they rise

Go shout it to the emerald seas -- give word to Erin now
Her honourable gentlemen are cleared -- and this is how

They only paid the Moonlighter his cattle-hocking price
They only helped the murderer with counsel 's best advice

But -- sure it keeps their honour white -- the learned Court believes
They never gave a piece of plate to murderers and thieves

They never told the ramping crowd to card a woman 's hide
They never marked a man for death -- what fault of theirs he died

They only said `` intimidate '' , and talked and went away
By God , the boys that did the work were braver men than they

Their sin it was that fed the fire -- small blame to them that heard
The `` bhoys '' get drunk on rhetoric , and madden at a word

They knew whom they were talking at , if they were Irish too
The gentlemen that lied in Court , they knew , and well they knew

They only took the Judas-gold from Fenians out of jail
They only fawned for dollars on the blood-dyed Clanna-Gael

If black is black or white is white , in black and white it 's down
They 're only traitors to the Queen and rebels to the Crown

`` Cleared '' , honourable gentlemen ! Be thankful it 's no more
The widow 's curse is on your house , the dead are at your door

On you the shame of open shame , on you from North to South
The hand of every honest man flat-heeled across your mouth

`` Less black than we were painted '' ? -- Faith , no word of black was said
The lightest touch was human blood , and that , you know , runs red

It 's sticking to your fist to-day for all your sneer and scoff
And by the Judge 's well-weighed word you can not wipe it off

Hold up those hands of innocence -- go , scare your sheep together
The blundering , tripping tups that bleat behind the old bell-wether

And if they snuff the taint and break to find another pen
Tell them it 's tar that glistens so , and daub them yours again

`` The charge is old '' ? -- As old as Cain -- as fresh as yesterday
Old as the Ten Commandments -- have ye talked those laws away

If words are words , or death is death , or powder sends the ball
You spoke the words that sped the shot -- the curse be on you all

`` Our friends believe '' ? -- Of course they do -- as sheltered women may
But have they seen the shrieking soul ripped from the quivering clay

They ! -- If their own front door is shut , they 'll swear the whole world 's warm
What do they know of dread of death or hanging fear of harm

The secret half a county keeps , the whisper in the lane
The shriek that tells the shot went home behind the broken pane

The dry blood crisping in the sun that scares the honest bees
And shows the `` bhoys '' have heard your talk -- what do they know of these

But you -- you know -- ay , ten times more ; the secrets of the dead
Black terror on the country-side by word and whisper bred

The mangled stallion 's scream at night , the tail-cropped heifer 's low
Who set the whisper going first ? You know , and well you know

My soul ! I 'd sooner lie in jail for murder plain and straight
Pure crime I 'd done with my own hand for money , lust , or hate

Than take a seat in Parliament by fellow-felons cheered
While one of those `` not provens '' proved me cleared as you are cleared

Cleared -- you that `` lost '' the League accounts -- go , guard our honour still
Go , help to make our country 's laws that broke God 's law at will

One hand stuck out behind the back , to signal `` strike again
The other on your dress-shirt-front to show your heart is clane

If black is black or white is white , in black and white it 's down
You 're only traitors to the Queen and rebels to the Crown

If print is print or words are words , the learned Court perpends
We are not ruled by murderers , but only -- by their friends

Now this is the tale of the Council the German Kaiser decreed
To ease the strong of their burden , to help the weak in their need

He sent a word to the peoples , who struggle , and pant , and sweat
That the straw might be counted fairly and the tally of bricks be set

The Lords of Their Hands assembled ; from the East and the West they drew
Baltimore , Lille , and Essen , Brummagem , Clyde , and Crewe

And some were black from the furnace , and some were brown from the soil
And some were blue from the dye-vat ; but all were wearied of toil

And the young King said : -- `` I have found it , the road to the rest ye seek
The strong shall wait for the weary , the hale shall halt for the weak

With the even tramp of an army where no man breaks from the line
Ye shall march to peace and plenty in the bond of brotherhood -- sign

The paper lay on the table , the strong heads bowed thereby
And a wail went up from the peoples : -- `` Ay , sign -- give rest , for we die

A hand was stretched to the goose-quill , a fist was cramped to scrawl
When -- the laugh of a blue-eyed maiden ran clear through the council-hall

And each one heard Her laughing as each one saw Her plain
Saidie , Mimi , or Olga , Gretchen , or Mary Jane

And the Spirit of Man that is in Him to the light of the vision woke
And the men drew back from the paper , as a Yankee delegate spoke

`` There 's a girl in Jersey City who works on the telephone
We 're going to hitch our horses and dig for a house of our own

With gas and water connections , and steam-heat through to the top
And , W. Hohenzollern , I guess I shall work till I drop

And an English delegate thundered : -- `` The weak an ' the lame be blowed
I 've a berth in the Sou'-West workshops , a home in the Wandsworth Road

And till the 'sociation has footed my buryin ' bill
I work for the kids an ' the missus . Pull up ? I be damned if I will

And over the German benches the bearded whisper ran
`` Lager , der girls und der dollars , dey makes or dey breaks a man

If Schmitt haf collared der dollars , he collars der girl deremit
But if Schmitt bust in der pizness , we collars der girl from Schmitt

They passed one resolution : -- `` Your sub-committee believe
You can lighten the curse of Adam when you 've lightened the curse of Eve

But till we are built like angels , with hammer and chisel and pen
We will work for ourself and a woman , for ever and ever , amen

Now this is the tale of the Council the German Kaiser held
The day that they razored the Grindstone , the day that the Cat was belled

The day of the Figs from Thistles , the day of the Twisted Sands
The day that the laugh of a maiden made light of the Lords of Their Hands

Now Tomlinson gave up the ghost in his house in Berkeley Square
And a Spirit came to his bedside and gripped him by the hair

A Spirit gripped him by the hair and carried him far away
Till he heard as the roar of a rain-fed ford the roar of the Milky Way

Till he heard the roar of the Milky Way die down and drone and cease
And they came to the Gate within the Wall where Peter holds the keys

`` Stand up , stand up now , Tomlinson , and answer loud and high
The good that ye did for the sake of men or ever ye came to die

The good that ye did for the sake of men in little earth so lone
And the naked soul of Tomlinson grew white as a rain-washed bone

`` O I have a friend on earth , '' he said , `` that was my priest and guide
And well would he answer all for me if he were by my side

-- `` For that ye strove in neighbour-love it shall be written fair
But now ye wait at Heaven 's Gate and not in Berkeley Square

Though we called your friend from his bed this night , he could not speak for you
For the race is run by one and one and never by two and two

Then Tomlinson looked up and down , and little gain was there
For the naked stars grinned overhead , and he saw that his soul was bare

The Wind that blows between the worlds , it cut him like a knife
And Tomlinson took up his tale and spoke of his good in life

`` This I have read in a book , '' he said , `` and that was told to me
And this I have thought that another man thought of a Prince in Muscovy

The good souls flocked like homing doves and bade him clear the path
And Peter twirled the jangling keys in weariness and wrath

`` Ye have read , ye have heard , ye have thought , '' he said , `` and the tale is yet to run
By the worth of the body that once ye had , give answer -- what ha ' ye done

Then Tomlinson looked back and forth , and little good it bore
For the Darkness stayed at his shoulder-blade and Heaven 's Gate before

`` O this I have felt , and this I have guessed , and this I have heard men say
And this they wrote that another man wrote of a carl in Norroway

-- `` Ye have read , ye have felt , ye have guessed , good lack ! Ye have hampered Heaven 's Gate
There 's little room between the stars in idleness to prate

O none may reach by hired speech of neighbour , priest , and kin
Through borrowed deed to God 's good meed that lies so fair within

Get hence , get hence to the Lord of Wrong , for doom has yet to run
And. . .the faith that ye share with Berkeley Square uphold you , Tomlinson

The Spirit gripped him by the hair , and sun by sun they fell
Till they came to the belt of Naughty Stars that rim the mouth of Hell

The first are red with pride and wrath , the next are white with pain
But the third are black with clinkered sin that can not burn again

They may hold their path , they may leave their path , with never a soul to mark
They may burn or freeze , but they must not cease in the Scorn of the Outer Dark

The Wind that blows between the worlds , it nipped him to the bone
And he yearned to the flare of Hell-Gate there as the light of his own hearth-stone

The Devil he sat behind the bars , where the desperate legions drew
But he caught the hasting Tomlinson and would not let him through

`` Wot ye the price of good pit-coal that I must pay ? '' said he
`` That ye rank yoursel ' so fit for Hell and ask no leave of me

I am all o'er-sib to Adam 's breed that ye should give me scorn
For I strove with God for your First Father the day that he was born

Sit down , sit down upon the slag , and answer loud and high
The harm that ye did to the Sons of Men or ever you came to die

And Tomlinson looked up and up , and saw against the night
The belly of a tortured star blood-red in Hell-Mouth light

And Tomlinson looked down and down , and saw beneath his feet
The frontlet of a tortured star milk-white in Hell-Mouth heat

`` O I had a love on earth , '' said he , `` that kissed me to my fall
And if ye would call my love to me I know she would answer all

-- `` All that ye did in love forbid it shall be written fair
But now ye wait at Hell-Mouth Gate and not in Berkeley Square

Though we whistled your love from her bed to-night , I trow she would not run
For the sin ye do by two and two ye must pay for one by one

The Wind that blows between the worlds , it cut him like a knife
And Tomlinson took up the tale and spoke of his sin in life

`` Once I ha ' laughed at the power of Love and twice at the grip of the Grave
And thrice I ha ' patted my God on the head that men might call me brave

The Devil he blew on a brandered soul and set it aside to cool
`` Do ye think I would waste my good pit-coal on the hide of a brain-sick fool

I see no worth in the hobnailed mirth or the jolthead jest ye did
That I should waken my gentlemen that are sleeping three on a grid

Then Tomlinson looked back and forth , and there was little grace
For Hell-Gate filled the houseless Soul with the Fear of Naked Space

`` Nay , this I ha ' heard , '' quo ' Tomlinson , `` and this was noised abroad
And this I ha ' got from a Belgian book on the word of a dead French lord

-- `` Ye ha ' heard , ye ha ' read , ye ha ' got , good lack ! and the tale begins afresh
Have ye sinned one sin for the pride o ' the eye or the sinful lust of the flesh

Then Tomlinson he gripped the bars and yammered , `` Let me in
For I mind that I borrowed my neighbour 's wife to sin the deadly sin

The Devil he grinned behind the bars , and banked the fires high
`` Did ye read of that sin in a book ? '' said he ; and Tomlinson said , `` Ay

The Devil he blew upon his nails , and the little devils ran
And he said : `` Go husk this whimpering thief that comes in the guise of a man

Winnow him out 'twixt star and star , and sieve his proper worth
There 's sore decline in Adam 's line if this be spawn of earth

Empusa 's crew , so naked-new they may not face the fire
But weep that they bin too small to sin to the height of their desire

Over the coal they chased the Soul , and racked it all abroad
As children rifle a caddis-case or the raven 's foolish hoard

And back they came with the tattered Thing , as children after play
And they said : `` The soul that he got from God he has bartered clean away

We have threshed a stook of print and book , and winnowed a chattering wind
And many a soul wherefrom he stole , but his we can not find

We have handled him , we have dandled him , we have seared him to the bone
And sure if tooth and nail show truth he has no soul of his own

The Devil he bowed his head on his breast and rumbled deep and low
`` I 'm all o'er-sib to Adam 's breed that I should bid him go

Yet close we lie , and deep we lie , and if I gave him place
My gentlemen that are so proud would flout me to my face

They 'd call my house a common stews and me a careless host
And -- I would not anger my gentlemen for the sake of a shiftless ghost

The Devil he looked at the mangled Soul that prayed to feel the flame
And he thought of Holy Charity , but he thought of his own good name

`` Now ye could haste my coal to waste , and sit ye down to fry
Did ye think of that theft for yourself ? '' said he ; and Tomlinson said , `` Ay

The Devil he blew an outward breath , for his heart was free from care
`` Ye have scarce the soul of a louse , '' he said , `` but the roots of sin are there

And for that sin should ye come in were I the lord alone
But sinful pride has rule inside -- and mightier than my own

Honour and Wit , fore-damned they sit , to each his priest and whore
Nay , scarce I dare myself go there , and you they 'd torture sore

Ye are neither spirit nor spirk , '' he said ; `` ye are neither book nor brute
Go , get ye back to the flesh again for the sake of Man 's repute

I 'm all o'er-sib to Adam 's breed that I should mock your pain
But look that ye win to worthier sin ere ye come back again

Get hence , the hearse is at your door -- the grim black stallions wait
They bear your clay to place to-day . Speed , lest ye come too late

Go back to Earth with a lip unsealed -- go back with an open eye
And carry my word to the Sons of Men or ever ye come to die

That the sin they do by two and two they must pay for one by one
And. . .the God that you took from a printed book be with you , Tomlinson

And this we do for a sign
Her power is over mine

( Humble ye , my people , and be fearful in your mirth
For the Lord our God Most High

Oh be ye not dismayed
Though we stumbled and we strayed

Except ye pay the Lord
Single heart and single sword

Make ye sure to each his own
That he reap where he hath sown

A song of little cunning ; of a singer nothing worth
Through the naked words and mean

We were dreamers , dreaming greatly , in the man-stifled town
We yearned beyond the sky-line where the strange roads go down

Came the Whisper , came the Vision , came the Power with the Need
Till the Soul that is not man 's soul was lent us to lead

As the deer breaks -- as the steer breaks -- from the herd where they graze
In the faith of little children we went on our ways

Then the wood failed -- then the food failed -- then the last water dried
In the faith of little children we lay down and died

On the sand-drift -- on the veldt-side -- in the fern-scrub we lay
That our sons might follow after by the bones on the way

Follow after -- follow after ! We have watered the root
And the bud has come to blossom that ripens for fruit

Follow after -- we are waiting , by the trails that we lost
For the sounds of many footsteps , for the tread of a host

Follow after -- follow after -- for the harvest is sown
By the bones about the wayside ye shall come to your own

One from the ends of the earth -- gifts at an open door
Treason has much , but we , Mother , thy sons have more

From the whine of a dying man , from the snarl of a wolf-pack freed
Turn , and the world is thine . Mother , be proud of thy seed

Count , are we feeble or few ? Hear , is our speech so rude
Look , are we poor in the land ? Judge , are we men of The Blood

Those that have stayed at thy knees , Mother , go call them in
We that were bred overseas wait and would speak with our kin

Not in the dark do we fight -- haggle and flout and gibe
Selling our love for a price , loaning our hearts for a bribe

Gifts have we only to-day -- Love without promise or fee
Hear , for thy children speak , from the uttermost parts of the sea

Truly ye come of The Blood ; slower to bless than to ban
Little used to lie down at the bidding of any man

Flesh of the flesh that I bred , bone of the bone that I bare
Stark as your sons shall be -- stern as your fathers were

Deeper than speech our love , stronger than life our tether
But we do not fall on the neck nor kiss when we come together

My arm is nothing weak , my strength is not gone by
Sons , I have borne many sons , but my dugs are not dry

Look , I have made ye a place and opened wide the doors
That ye may talk together , your Barons and Councillors

Wards of the Outer March , Lords of the Lower Seas
Ay , talk to your gray mother that bore you on her knees

That ye may talk together , brother to brother 's face
Thus for the good of your peoples -- thus for the Pride of the Race

Also , we will make promise . So long as The Blood endures
I shall know that your good is mine : ye shall feel that my strength is yours

In the day of Armageddon , at the last great fight of all
That Our House stand together and the pillars do not fall

Draw now the threefold knot firm on the ninefold bands
And the Law that ye make shall be law after the rule of your lands

This for the waxen Heath , and that for the Wattle-bloom
This for the Maple-leaf , and that for the southern Broom

The Law that ye make shall be law and I do not press my will
Because ye are Sons of The Blood and call me Mother still

Now must ye speak to your kinsmen and they must speak to you
After the use of the English , in straight-flung words and few

Go to your work and be strong , halting not in your ways
Balking the end half-won for an instant dole of praise

Stand to your work and be wise -- certain of sword and pen
Who are neither children nor Gods , but men in a world of men

Calling to the Angels and the Souls in their degree
`` Lo ! Earth has passed away

`` Plague upon the hurricane that made us furl and flee
But the war is done between us

`` Lord , hast Thou forgotten Thy covenant with me
How once a year I go

( He that bits the thunder when the bull-mouthed breakers flee
`` I have watch and ward to keep

`` Nay , but we were angry , and a hasty folk are we
If we worked the ship together

`` Kennelled in the picaroon a weary band were we
But Thy arm was strong to save

`` Once we frapped a ship , and she laboured woundily
There were fourteen score of these

Plucking at their harps , and they plucked unhandily
`` Our thumbs are rough and tarred

Fettered wrist to bar all for red iniquity
`` Ho , we revel in our chains

( He that led the flinching in the fleets of fair Dundee
`` Oh , the ice-blink white and near

Crying : `` Under Heaven , here is neither lead nor lee
Must we sing for evermore

And 'stablished his borders unto all eternity
That such as have no pleasure

Stinging , ringing spindrift , nor the fulmar flying free
And the ships shall go abroad

And the life we live and know
Let a fellow sing o ' the little things he cares about

Let a fellow sing o ' the little things he cares about
If a fellow fights for the little things he cares about

All bound to sing o ' the Little things we care about
All bound to fight for the Little things we care about

With the weight of a six-fold blow
By the might of our Cable-tow

And jasper tips the spear to-day
Changed are the Gods of Hunt and Dance

Hold him who scorns our hutted piers
Lost hills whereby we dare not dwell

Of arquebus and culverin
Honour is lost , and none may tell

Heave up the wharf where we would be
The known and noted breezes swell

Our speed is timed to half a turn
Sure as the ferried barge we ply

And left the local -- late again
Confound Romance ! . . . And all unseen

His fog-horn cut the reeking Banks
By dock and deep and mine and mill

Hedged in a backward-gazing world
Then taught his chosen bard to say

Now this is the Law of the Muscovite , that he proves with shot and steel
When ye come by his isles in the Smoky Sea ye must not take the seal

Where the gray sea goes nakedly between the weed-hung shelves
And the little blue fox he is bred for his skin and the seal they breed for themselves

For when the ~matkas~ seek the shore to drop their pups aland
The great man-seal haul out of the sea , a-roaring , band by band

And when the first September gales have slaked their rutting-wrath
The great man-seal haul back to the sea and no man knows their path

Then dark they lie and stark they lie -- rookery , dune , and floe
And the Northern Lights come down o ' nights to dance with the houseless snow

And God Who clears the grounding berg and steers the grinding floe
He hears the cry of the little kit-fox and the wind along the snow

But since our women must walk gay and money buys their gear
The sealing-boats they filch that way at hazard year by year

English they be and Japanee that hang on the Brown Bear 's flank
And some be Scot , but the worst of the lot , and the boldest thieves , be Yank

It was the sealer ~Northern Light~ , to the Smoky Seas she bore
With a stovepipe stuck from a starboard port and the Russian flag at her fore

( ~Baltic~ , ~Stralsund~ , and ~Northern Light~ -- oh ! they were birds of a feather
Slipping away to the Smoky Seas , three seal-thieves together

And at last she came to a sandy cove and the Baltic lay therein
But her men were up with the herding seal to drive and club and skin

There were fifteen hundred skins abeach , cool pelt and proper fur
When the ~Northern Light~ drove into the bight and the sea-mist drove with her

The ~Baltic~ called her men and weighed -- she could not choose but run
For a stovepipe seen through the closing mist , it shows like a four-inch gun

( And loss it is that is sad as death to lose both trip and ship
And lie for a rotting contraband on Vladivostock slip

She turned and dived in the sea-smother as a rabbit dives in the whins
And the ~Northern Light~ sent up her boats to steal the stolen skins

They had not brought a load to side or slid their hatches clear
When they were aware of a sloop-of-war , ghost-white and very near

Her flag she showed , and her guns she showed -- three of them , black , abeam
And a funnel white with the crusted salt , but never a show of steam

There was no time to man the brakes , they knocked the shackle free
And the ~Northern Light~ stood out again , goose-winged to open sea

( For life it is that is worse than death , by force of Russian law
To work in the mines of mercury that loose the teeth in your jaw

They had not run a mile from shore -- they heard no shots behind
When the skipper smote his hand on his thigh and threw her up in the wind

`` Bluffed -- raised out on a bluff , '' said he , `` for if my name 's Tom Hall
You must set a thief to catch a thief -- and a thief has caught us all

By every butt in Oregon and every spar in Maine
The hand that spilled the wind from her sail was the hand of Reuben Paine

He has rigged and trigged her with paint and spar , and , faith , he has faked her well
But I 'd know the ~Stralsund~ 's deckhouse yet from here to the booms o ' Hell

Oh , once we ha ' met at Baltimore , and twice on Boston pier
But the sickest day for you , Reuben Paine , was the day that you came here

The day that you came here , my lad , to scare us from our seal
With your funnel made o ' your painted cloth , and your guns o ' rotten deal

Ring and blow for the ~Baltic~ now , and head her back to the bay
And we 'll come into the game again -- with a double deck to play

They rang and blew the sealers ' call -- the poaching cry of the sea
And they raised the ~Baltic~ out of the mist , and an angry ship was she

And blind they groped through the whirling white and blind to the bay again
Till they heard the creak of the ~Stralsund~ 's boom and the clank of her mooring chain

They laid them down by bitt and boat , their pistols in their belts
And : `` Will you fight for it , Reuben Paine , or will you share the pelts

A dog-toothed laugh laughed Reuben Paine , and bared his flenching-knife
`` Yea , skin for skin , and all that he hath a man will give for his life

But I 've six thousand skins below , and Yeddo Port to see
And there 's never a law of God or man runs north of Fifty-Three

So go in peace to the naked seas with empty holds to fill
And I 'll be good to your seal this catch , as many as I shall kill

Answered the snap of a closing lock and the jar of a gun-butt slid
But the tender fog shut fold on fold to hide the wrong they did

The weeping fog rolled fold on fold the wrath of man to cloak
And the flame-spurts pale ran down the rail as the sealing-rifles spoke

The bullets bit on bend and butt , the splinter slivered free
( Little they trust to sparrow-dust that stop the seal in his sea

The thick smoke hung and would not shift , leaden it lay and blue
But three were down on the ~Baltic~ 's deck and two of the ~Stralsund~ 's crew

An arm's-length out and overside the banked fog held them bound
But , as they heard or groan or word , they fired at the sound

For one cried out on the Name of God , and one to have him cease
And the questing volley found them both and bade them hold their peace

And one called out on a heathen joss and one on the Virgin 's Name
And the schooling bullet leaped across and showed them whence they came

And in the waiting silences the rudder whined beneath
And each man drew his watchful breath slow taken 'tween the teeth

Trigger and ear and eye acock , knit brow and hard-drawn lips
Bracing his feet by chock and cleat for the rolling of the ships

Till they heard the cough of a wounded man that fought in the fog for breath
Till they heard the torment of Reuben Paine that wailed upon his death

`` The tides they 'll go through Fundy Race but I 'll go nevermore
And see the hogs from ebb-tide mark turn scampering back to shore

No more I 'll see the trawlers drift below the Bass Rock ground
Or watch the tall Fall steamer lights tear blazing up the Sound

Sorrow is me , in a lonely sea and a sinful fight I fall
But if there 's law o ' God or man you 'll swing for it yet , Tom Hall

Tom Hall stood up by the quarter-rail . `` Your words in your teeth , '' said he
`` There 's never a law of God or man runs north of Fifty-Three

So go in grace with Him to face , and an ill-spent life behind
And I 'll be good to your widows , Rube , as many as I shall find

A ~Stralsund~ man shot blind and large , and a war-lock Finn was he
And he hit Tom Hall with a bursting ball a hand's-breadth over the knee

Tom Hall caught hold by the topping-lift , and sat him down with an oath
`` You 'll wait a little , Rube , '' he said , `` the Devil has called for both

The Devil is driving both this tide , and the killing-grounds are close
And we 'll go up to the Wrath of God as the holluschickie goes

O men , put back your guns again and lay your rifles by
We 've fought our fight , and the best are down . Let up and let us die

Quit firing , by the bow there -- quit ! Call off the ~Baltic~ 's crew
You 're sure of Hell as me or Rube -- but wait till we get through

There went no word between the ships , but thick and quick and loud
The life-blood drummed on the dripping decks , with the fog-dew from the shroud

The sea-pull drew them side by side , gunnel to gunnel laid
And they felt the sheerstrakes pound and clear , but never a word was said

Then Reuben Paine cried out again before his spirit passed
`` Have I followed the sea for thirty years to die in the dark at last

Curse on her work that has nipped me here with a shifty trick unkind
I have gotten my death where I got my bread , but I dare not face it blind

Curse on the fog ! Is there never a wind of all the winds I knew
To clear the smother from off my chest , and let me look at the blue

The good fog heard -- like a splitten sail , to left and right she tore
And they saw the sun-dogs in the haze and the seal upon the shore

Silver and gray ran spit and bay to meet the steel-backed tide
And pinched and white in the clearing light the crews stared overside

O rainbow-gay the red pools lay that swilled and spilled and spread
And gold , raw gold , the spent shell rolled between the careless dead

The dead that rocked so drunkenwise to weather and to lee
And they saw the work their hands had done as God had bade them see

And a little breeze blew over the rail that made the headsails lift
But no man stood by wheel or sheet , and they let the schooners drift

And the rattle rose in Reuben 's throat and he cast his soul with a cry
And `` Gone already ? '' Tom Hall he said . `` Then it 's time for me to die

His eyes were heavy with great sleep and yearning for the land
And he spoke as a man that talks in dreams , his wound beneath his hand

`` Oh , there comes no good o ' the westering wind that backs against the sun
Wash down the decks -- they 're all too red -- and share the skins and run

~Baltic~ , ~Stralsund~ , and ~Northern Light~ -- clean share and share for all
You 'll find the fleets off Tolstoi Mees , but you will not find Tom Hall

Evil he did in shoal-water and blacker sin on the deep
But now he 's sick of watch and trick and now he 'll turn and sleep

He 'll have no more of the crawling sea that made him suffer so
But he 'll lie down on the killing-grounds where the holluschickie go

And west you 'll sail and south again , beyond the sea-fog 's rim
And tell the Yoshiwara girls to burn a stick for him

And you 'll not weight him by the heels and dump him overside
But carry him up to the sand-hollows to die as Bering died

And make a place for Reuben Paine that knows the fight was fair
And leave the two that did the wrong to talk it over there

Half-steam ahead by guess and lead , for the sun is mostly veiled
Through fog to fog , by luck and log , sail ye as Bering sailed

And if the light shall lift aright to give your landfall plain
North and by west , from Zapne Crest , ye raise the Crosses Twain

Fair marks are they to the inner bay , the reckless poacher knows
What time the scarred see-catchie lead their sleek seraglios

Ever they hear the floe-pack clear , and the blast of the old bull-whale
And the deep seal-roar that beats off-shore above the loudest gale

Ever they wait the winter 's hate as the thundering ~boorga~ calls
Where northward look they to St. George , and westward to St. Paul 's

Ever they greet the hunted fleet -- lone keels off headlands drear
When the sealing-schooners flit that way at hazard year by year

Of a hidden sea and a hidden fight
When the ~Baltic~ ran from the ~Northern Light~

A Rose , in tatters on the garden path
Cried out to God and murmured 'gainst His Wrath

Because a sudden wind at twilight 's hush
Had snapped her stem alone of all the bush

And God , Who hears both sun-dried dust and sun
Had pity , whispering to that luckless one

`` Sister , in that thou sayest We did not well
What voices heardst thou when thy petals fell

And the Rose answered , `` In that evil hour
A voice said , ` Father , wherefore falls the flower

For lo , the very gossamers are still
And a voice answered , ` Son , by Allah 's will

Then softly as a rain-mist on the sward
Came to the Rose the Answer of the Lord

`` Sister , before We smote the dark in twain
Ere yet the stars saw one another plain

Time , Tide , and Space , We bound unto the task
That thou shouldst fall , and such an one should ask

Whereat the withered flower , all content
Died as they die whose days are innocent

While he who questioned why the flower fell
Caught hold of God and saved his soul from Hell

Once , on a glittering ice-field , ages and ages ago
Ung , a maker of pictures , fashioned an image of snow

Fashioned the form of a tribesman -- gaily he whistled and sung
Working the snow with his fingers . ~Read ye the Story of Ung ! ~

Pleased was his tribe with that image -- came in their hundreds to scan
Handled it , smelt it , and grunted : `` Verily , this is a man

Thus do we carry our lances -- thus is a war-belt slung
Lo ! it is even as we are . Glory and honour to Ung

Later he pictured an aurochs -- later he pictured a bear
Pictured the sabre-tooth tiger dragging a man to his lair

Pictured the mountainous mammoth , hairy , abhorrent , alone
Out of the love that he bore them , scribing them clearly on bone

Swift came the tribe to behold them , peering and pushing and still
Men of the berg-battered beaches , men of the boulder-hatched hill

Hunters and fishers and trappers , presently whispering low
`` Yea , they are like -- and it may be -- But how does the Picture-man know

`` Ung -- hath he slept with the Aurochs -- watched where the Mastodon roam
Spoke on the ice with the Bow-head -- followed the Sabre-tooth home

Nay ! These are toys of his fancy ! If he have cheated us so
How is there truth in his image -- the man that he fashioned of snow

Wroth was that maker of pictures -- hotly he answered the call
`` Hunters and fishers and trappers , children and fools are ye all

Look at the beasts when ye hunt them ! '' Swift from the tumult he broke
Ran to the cave of his father and told him the shame that they spoke

And the father of Ung gave answer , that was old and wise in the craft
Maker of pictures aforetime , he leaned on his lance and laughed

`` If they could see as thou seest they would do what thou hast done
And each man would make him a picture , and -- what would become of my son

`` There would be no pelts of the reindeer , flung down at thy cave for a gift
Nor dole of the oily timber that comes on the Baltic drift

No store of well-drilled needles , nor ouches of amber pale
No new-cut tongues of the bison , nor meat of the stranded whale

`` ~Thou~ hast not toiled at the fishing when the sodden trammels freeze
Nor worked the war-boats outward through the rush of the rock-staked seas

Yet they bring thee fish and plunder -- full meal and an easy bed
And all for the sake of thy pictures . '' And Ung held down his head

`` ~Thou~ hast not stood to the Aurochs when the red snow reeks of the fight
Men have no time at the houghing to count his curls aright

And the heart of the hairy Mammoth , thou sayest , they do not see
Yet they save it whole from the beaches and broil the best for thee

`` And now do they press to thy pictures , with opened mouth and eye
And a little gift in the doorway , and the praise no gift can buy

But -- sure they have doubted thy pictures , and that is a grievous stain
Son that can see so clearly , return them their gifts again

And Ung looked down at his deerskins -- their broad shell-tasselled bands
And Ung drew downward his mitten and looked at his naked hands

And he gloved himself and departed , and he heard his father , behind
`` Son that can see so clearly , rejoice that thy tribe is blind

Straight on the glittering ice-field , by the caves of the lost Dordogne
Ung , a maker of pictures , fell to his scribing on bone

Even to mammoth editions . Gaily he whistled and sung
Blessing his tribe for their blindness . ~Heed ye the Story of Ung ! ~

Full thirty foot she towered from waterline to rail
It cost a watch to steer her , and a week to shorten sail

But , spite all modern notions , I found her first and best
The only certain packet for the Islands of the Blest

Fair held the breeze behind us -- 't was warm with lovers ' prayers
We 'd stolen wills for ballast and a crew of missing heirs

They shipped as Able Bastards till the Wicked Nurse confessed
And they worked the old three-decker to the Islands of the Blest

By ways no gaze could follow , a course unspoiled of Cook
Per Fancy , fleetest in man , our titled berths we took

With maids of matchless beauty and parentage unguessed
And a Church of England parson for the Islands of the Blest

We asked no social questions -- we pumped no hidden shame
We never talked obstetrics when the Little Stranger came

We left the Lord in Heaven , we left the fiends in Hell
We were n't exactly Yussufs , but -- Zuleika did n't tell

No moral doubt assailed us , so when the port we neared
The villain had his flogging at the gangway , and we cheered

'T was fiddle in the forc's'le -- 't was garlands on the mast
For every one got married , and I went ashore at last

I left 'em all in couples a-kissing on the decks
I left the lovers loving and the parents signing cheques

In endless English comfort by county-folk caressed
I left the old three-decker at the Islands of the Blest

That route is barred to steamers : you 'll never lift again
Our purple-painted headlands or the lordly keeps of Spain

They 're just beyond your skyline , howe'er so far you cruise
In a ram-you-damn-you liner with a brace of bucking screws

Swing round your aching search-light -- 'twill show no haven 's peace
Ay , blow your shrieking sirens to the deaf , gray-bearded seas

Boom out the dripping oil-bags to skin the deep 's unrest
And you are n't one knot the nearer to the Islands of the Blest

But when you 're threshing , crippled , with broken bridge and rail
At a drogue of dead convictions to hold you head to gale

Calm as the Flying Dutchman , from truck to taffrail dressed
You 'll see the old three-decker for the Islands of the Blest

You 'll see her tiering canvas in sheeted silver spread
You 'll hear the long-drawn thunder 'neath her leaping figure-head

While far , so far above you , her tall poop-lanterns shine
Unvexed by wind or weather like the candles round a shrine

Hull down -- hull down and under -- she dwindles to a speck
With noise of pleasant music and dancing on her deck

All 's well -- all 's well aboard her -- she 's left you far behind
With a scent of old-world roses through the fog that ties you blind

Her crew are babes or madmen ? Her port is all to make
You 're manned by Truth and Science , and you steam for steaming 's sake

Well , tinker up your engines -- you know your business best
~She~ 's taking tired people to the Islands of the Blest

I 've paid for your sickest fancies ; I 've humoured your crackedest whim
Dick , it 's your daddy , dying ; you 've got to listen to him

Good for a fortnight , am I ? The doctor told you ? He lied
I shall go under by morning , and -- Put that nurse outside

'Never seen death yet , Dickie ? Well , now is your time to learn
And you 'll wish you held my record before it comes to your turn

Not counting the Line and the Foundry , the yards and the village , too
I 've made myself and a million ; but I 'm damned if I made you

Master at two-and-twenty , and married at twenty-three
Ten thousand men on the pay-roll , and forty freighters at sea

Fifty years between 'em , and every year of it fight
And now I 'm Sir Anthony Gloster , dying , a baronite

For I lunched with his Royal HIghness -- what was it the papers a-had
`` Not least of our merchant-princes . '' Dickie , that 's me , your dad

~I~ did n't begin with askings . ~I~ took my job and I stuck
And I took the chances they would n't , an ' now they 're calling it luck

Lord , what boats I 've handled -- rotten and leaky and old
Ran 'em , or -- opened the bilge-cock , precisely as I was told

Grub that hud bind you crazy , and crews that hud turn you grey
And a big fat lump of insurance to cover the risk on the way

The others they durs n't do it ; they said they valued their life
( They 've served me since as skippers ) . ~I~ went , and I took my wife

Over the world I drove 'em , married at twenty-three
And your mother saving the money and making a man of me

~I~ was content to be master , but she said there was better behind
She took the chances I would n't , and I followed your mother blind

She egged me to borrow the money , an ' she helped me to clear the loan
When we bought half shares in a cheap hun and hoisted a flag of our own

Patching and coaling on credit , and living the Lord knew how
We started the Red Ox freighters -- we 've eight-and-thirty now

And those were the days of clippers , and the freights were clipper-freights
And we knew we were making our fortune , but she died in Macassar Straits

By the Little Paternosters , as you come to the Union Bank
And we dropped her in fourteen fathom ; I pricked it off where she sank

Owners we were , full owners , and the boat was christened for her
And she died in the ~Mary Gloster~ . My heart , how young we were

So I went on a spree round Java and well-nigh ran her ashore
But your mother came and warned me and I would n't liquor no more

Strict I stuck to my business , afraid to stop or I 'd think
Saving the money ( she warned me ) , and letting the other men drink

And I met M'Cullough in London ( I 'd turned five hundred then
And 'tween us we started the Foundry -- three forges and twenty men

Cheap repairs for the cheap huns . It paid , and the business grew
For I bought me a steam-lathe patent , and that was a gold mine too

`` Cheaper to build 'em than buy 'em , '' ~I~ said , but M'Cullough he shied
And we wasted a year in talking before we moved to the Clyde

And the Lines were all beginning , and we all of us started fair
Building our engines like houses and staying the boilers square

But M'Cullough he wanted cabins with marble and maple and all
And Brussels an ' Utrecht velvet , and baths and a Social Hall

And pipes for closets all over , and cutting the frames too light
But M'Cullough he died in the Sixties , and -- Well , I 'm dying to-night

I knew -- ~I~ knew what was coming , when we bid on the ~Byfleet~ 's keel
They piddled and piffled with iron : I 'd given my orders for steel

Steel and the first expansions . It paid , I tell you , it paid
When we came with our nine-knot freighters and collared the long-run trade

And they asked me how I did it , and I gave 'em the Scripture text
`` You keep your light so shining a little in front o ' the next

They copied all they could follow , but they could n't copy my mind
And I left 'em sweating and stealing a year and a half behind

Then came the armour-contracts , but that was M'Cullough 's side
He was always best in the Foundry , but better , perhaps , he died

I went through his private papers ; the notes was plainer than print
And I 'm no fool to finish if a man 'll give me a hint

( I remember his widow was angry . ) So I saw what the drawings meant
And I started the six-inch rollers , and it paid me sixty per cent

Sixty per cent ~with~ failures , and more than twice we could do
And a quarter-million to credit , and I saved it all for you

I thought -- it does n't matter -- you seemed to favour your ma
But you 're nearer forty than thirty , and I know the kind you are

Harrer an ' Trinity College ! I ought to ha ' sent you to sea
But I stood you an education , an ' what have you done for me

The things I knew was proper you would n't thank me to give
And the things I knew was rotten you said was the way to live

For you muddled with books and pictures , an ' china an ' etchin 's an ' fans
And your rooms at college was beastly -- more like a whore 's than a man 's

Till you married that thin-flanked woman , as white and as stale as a bone
An ' she gave you your social nonsense ; but where 's that kid o ' your own

I 've seen your carriages blocking the half o ' the Cromwell Road
But never the doctor 's brougham to help the missus unload

( So there is n't even a grandchild , an ' the Gloster family 's done
Not like your mother , she is n't . ~She~ carried her freight each run

But they died , the pore little beggars ! At sea she had 'em -- they died
Only you , an ' you stood it ; you have n't stood much beside

Weak , a liar , and idle , and mean as a collier 's whelp
Nosing for scraps in the galley . No help -- my son was no help

So he gets three hundred thousand , in trust and the interest paid
I would n't give it you , Dickie -- you see , I made it in trade

You 're saved from soiling your fingers , and if you have no child
It all comes back to the business . Gad , wo n't your wife be wild

'Calls and calls in her carriage , her handkerchief up to her eye
`` Daddy ! dear daddy 's dyin ' ! '' and doing her best to cry

Grateful ? Oh , yes , I 'm grateful , but keep her away from here
Your mother hud never ha ' stood 'er , and , anyhow , women are queer

There 's women will say I 've married a second time.Not quite
But give pore Aggie a hundred , and tell her your lawyers 'll fight

She was the best o ' the boiling -- you 'll meet her before it ends
I 'm in for a row with the mother -- I 'll leave you settle my friends

For a man he must go with a woman , which women do n't understand
Or the sort that say they can see it they are n't the marrying brand

But I wanted to speak o ' your mother that 's Lady Gloster still
I 'm going to up and see her , without it 's hurting the will

Here ! Take your hand off the bell-pull . Five thousand 's waiting for you
If you 'll only listen a minute , and do as I bid you do

They 'll try to prove me crazy , and , if you bungle , they can
And I 've only you to trust to ! ( O God , why ai n't he a man

There 's some waste money on marbles , the same as M'Cullough tried
Marbles and mausoleums -- but I call that sinful pride

There 's some ship bodies for burial -- we 've carried 'em , soldered and packed
Down in their wills they wrote it , and nobody called ~them~ cracked

But me -- I 've too much money , and people might. . . . All my fault
It come o ' hoping for grandsons and buying that Wokin ' vault

I 'm sick o ' the whole dam ' business ; I 'm going back where I came
Dick , you 're the son o ' my body , and you 'll take charge o ' the same

I want to lie by your mother , ten thousand mile away
And they 'll want to send me to Woking ; and that 's where you 'll earn your pay

I 've thought it out on the quiet , the same as it ought to be done
Quiet , and decent , and proper -- an ' here 's your orders , my son

You know the Line ? You do n't , though . You write to the Board , and tell
Your father 's death has upset you an ' you 're goin ' to cruise for a spell

An ' you 'd like the ~Mary Gloster~ -- I 've held her ready for this
They 'll put her in working order and you 'll take her out as she is

Yes , it was money idle when I patched her and put her aside
( Thank God , I can pay for my fancies ! ) -- the boat where your mother died

By the Little Paternosters , as you come to the Union Bank
We dropped her -- I think I told you -- and I pricked it off where she sank

[ 'Tiny she looked on the grating -- that oily , treacly sea -- ]
'Hundred and eighteen East , remember , and South just three

Easy bearings to carry -- three South -- three to the dot
But I gave MHAndrew a copy in case of dying -- or not

And so you 'll write to MHAndrew , he 's Chief of the Maori Line
They 'll give him leave , if you ask 'em and say it 's business o ' mine

I built three boats for the Maoris , an ' very well pleased they were
An ' I 've known Mac since the Fifties , and Mac knew me -- and her

After the first stroke warned me I sent him the money to keep
Against the time you 'd claim it , committin ' your dad to the deep

For you are the son o ' my body , and Mac was my oldest friend
I 've never asked him to dinner , but he 'll see it out to the end

Stiff-necked Glasgow beggar , I 've heard he 's prayed for my soul
But he could n't lie if you paid him , and he 'd starve before he stole

He 'll take the ~Mary~ in ballast -- you 'll find her a lively ship
And you 'll take Sir Anthony Gloster , that goes on his wedding-trip

Lashed in our old deck-cabin with all three port-holes wide
The kick o ' the screw beneath him and the round blue seas outside

Sir Anthony Gloster 's carriage -- our house-flag flyin ' free
Ten thousand men on the pay-roll and forty freighters at sea

He made himself and a million , but this world is a fleetin ' show
And he 'll go to the wife of his bosom the same as he ought to go

By the heel of the Paternosters -- there is n't a chance to mistake
And Mac 'll pay you the money as soon as the bubbles break

Five thousand for six weeks ' cruising , the staunchest freighter afloat
And Mac he 'll give you your bonus the minute I 'm out o ' the boat

He 'll take you round to Macassar , and you 'll come back alone
He knows what I want o ' the ~Mary~. . . . I 'll do what I please with my own

Your mother hud call it wasteful , but I 've seven-and-thirty more
I 'll come in my private carriage and bid it wait at the door

For my son he was never a credit : he muddled with books and art
And he lived on Sir Anthony 's money and he broke Sir Anthony 's heart

There is n't even a grandchild , and the Gloster family 's done
The only one you left me , O mother , the only one

Harrer and Trinity College -- me slavin ' early an ' late
An ' he thinks I 'm dying crazy , and you 're in Macassar Strait

Flesh o ' my flesh , my dearie , for ever an ' ever amen
That first stroke come for a warning ; I ought to ha ' gone to you then

But -- cheap repairs for a cheap hun -- the doctors said I 'd do
Mary , why did n't ~you~ warn me ? I 've allus heeded to you

Excep ' -- I know -- about women ; but you are a spirit now
An ' , wife , they was only women , and I was a man . That 's how

An ' a man he must go with a woman , as you could not understand
But I never talked 'em secrets . I paid 'em out o ' hand

Thank Gawd , I can pay for my fancies ! Now what 's five thousand to me
For a berth off the Paternosters in the haven where I would be

~I~ believe in the Resurrection , if I read my Bible plain
But I would n't trust 'em at Wokin ' ; we 're safer at sea again

For the heart it shall go with the treasure -- go down to the sea in ships
I 'm sick of the hired women -- I 'll kiss my girl on her lips

I 'll be content with my fountain , I 'll drink from my own well
And the wife of my youth shall charm me -- an ' the rest can go to Hell

( Dickie , ~he~ will , that 's certain . ) I 'll lie in our standin'-bed
An ' Mac 'll take her in ballast -- an ' she trims best by the head

Down by the head an ' sinkin ' , her fires are drawn and cold
And the water 's splashin ' hollow on the skin of the empty hold

Churning an ' choking and chuckling , quiet and scummy and dark
Full to her lower hatches and risin ' steady . Hark

That was the after-bulkhead. . . . She 's flooded from stem to stern
Never seen death yet , Dickie ? . . . Well , now is your time to learn

( `` It 's all one , '' says the Sapper

Oh , strike your camp an ' go , the Bugle 's callin
The Rains are fallin

The Band 's a-doin ' all she knows to cheer us
The Chaplain 's gone and prayed to Gawd to hear us

Since August , when it started , it 's been stickin ' to our tail
Though they 've had us out by marches an ' they 've had us back by rail

But it runs as fast as troop-trains , and we can not get away
An ' the sick-list to the Colonel makes ten more to-day

There ai n't no fun in women nor there ai n't no bite to drink
It 's much too wet for shootin ' , we can only march and think

An ' at evenin ' , down the ~nullahs~ , we can hear the jackals say
`` Get up , you rotten beggars , you 've ten more to-day

'Twould make a monkey cough to see our way o ' doin ' things
Lieutenants takin ' companies an ' captains takin ' wings

An ' Lances actin ' Sergeants -- eight file to obey
For we 've lots o ' quick promotion on ten deaths a day

Our Colonel 's white an ' twitterly -- he gets no sleep nor food
But mucks about in 'orspital where nothing does no good

HE sends us heaps o ' comforts , all bought from his pay
But there are n't much comfort handy on ten deaths a day

Our Chaplain 's got a banjo , an ' a skinny mule he rides
An ' the stuff he says an ' sings us , Lord , it makes us split our sides

With his black coat-tails a-bobbin ' to ~Ta-ra-ra Boomderay ! ~
he 's the proper kind o ' ~padre~ for ten deaths a day

An ' Father Victor helps him with our Roman Catholicks
He knows an heap of Irish songs an ' rummy conjurin ' tricks

An ' the two they works together when it comes to play or pray
So we keep the ball a-rollin ' on ten deaths a day

We 've got the cholerer in camp -- we 've got it hot an ' sweet
It ai n't no Christmas dinner , but it 's helped an ' we must eat

We 've gone beyond the funkin ' , 'cause we 've found it does n't pay
An ' we 're rockin ' round the Districk on ten deaths a day

Then , Number One , let down the tent-pole slow

The heathen in his blindness bows down to wood an ' stone
HE do n't obey no orders unless they is his own

HE keeps his side-arms awful : he leaves 'em all about
An ' then comes up the regiment an ' pokes the heathen out

All along o ' dirtiness , all along o ' mess
All along o ' doin ' things rather-more-or-less

All along of abby-nay , kul , an ' hazar-ho , *
Mind you keep your rifle an ' yourself jus ' so

The young recruit is haughty -- he draf 's from Gawd knows where
They bid him show his stockin 's an ' lay his mattress square

HE calls it bloomin ' nonsense -- he does n't know no more
An ' then up comes his Company an ' kicks him round the floor

The young recruit is hammered -- he takes it very hard
HE hangs his head an ' mutters -- he sulks about the yard

HE talks o ' `` cruel tyrants '' he 'll swing for by-an'-by
An ' the others hears an ' mocks him , an ' the boy goes orf to cry

The young recruit is silly -- he thinks o ' suicide
he 's lost his gutter-devil ; he has n't got his pride

But day by day they kicks him , which helps him on a bit
Till he finds hisself one mornin ' with a full an ' proper kit

Gettin ' clear o ' dirtiness , gettin ' done with mess
Gettin ' shut o ' doin ' things rather-more-or-less

Not so fond of abby-nay , kul , nor hazar-ho
Learns to keep his rifle an ' hisself jus ' so

The young recruit is happy -- he throws a chest to suit
You see him grow mustaches ; you hear him slap his boot

HE learns to drop the `` bloodies '' from every word he slings
An ' he shows an healthy brisket when he strips for bars an ' rings

The cruel-tyrant-sergeants they watch him harf a year
They watch him with his comrades , they watch him with his beer

They watch him with the women at the regimental dance
And the cruel-tyrant-sergeants send his name along for `` Lance

An ' now he 's harf o ' nothin ' , an ' all a private yet
HIs room they up an ' rags him to see what they will get

They rags him low an ' cunnin ' , each dirty trick they can
But he learns to sweat his temper an ' he learns to sweat his man

An ' , last , a Colour-Sergeant , as such to be obeyed
HE schools his men at cricket , he tells 'em on parade

They sees 'em quick an ' handy , uncommon set an ' smart
An ' so he talks to orficers which have the Core at heart

HE learns to do his watchin ' without it showin ' plain
HE learns to save a dummy , an ' shove him straight again

HE learns to check a ranker that 's buyin ' leave to shirk
An ' he learns to make men like him so they 'll learn to like their work

An ' when it comes to marchin ' he 'll see their socks are right
An ' when it comes to action he shows 'em how to sight

HE knows their ways of thinkin ' and just what 's in their mind
HE knows when they are takin ' on an ' when they 've fell behind

HE knows each talkin ' corpril that leads a squad astray
HE feels his innards heavin ' , his bowels givin ' way

HE sees the blue-white faces all tryin ' hard to grin
An ' he stands an ' waits an ' suffers till it 's time to cap 'em in

An ' now the hugly bullets come peckin ' through the dust
An ' no one wants to face 'em , but every beggar must

So , like a man in irons which is n't glad to go
They moves 'em off by companies uncommon stiff an ' slow

Of all his five years ' schoolin ' they do n't remember much
Excep ' the not retreatin ' , the step an ' keepin ' touch

It looks like teachin ' wasted when they duck an ' spread an ' hop
But if he had n't learned 'em they 'd be all about the shop

An ' now it 's `` 'Oo goes backward ? '' an ' now it 's `` 'Oo comes on
And now it 's `` Get the doolies , '' an ' now the captain 's gone

An ' now it 's bloody murder , but all the while they hear
HIs voice , the same as barrick drill , a-shepherdin ' the rear

he 's just as sick as they are , his heart is like to split
But he works 'em , works 'em , works 'em till he feels 'em take the bit

The rest is holdin ' steady till the watchful bugles play
An ' he lifts 'em , lifts 'em , lifts 'em through the charge that wins the day

The heathen in his blindness bows down to wood an ' stone
HE do n't obey no orders unless they is his own

The heathen in his blindness must end where he began
But the backbone of the Army is the non-commissioned man

Keep away from dirtiness -- keep away from mess
Do n't get into doin ' things rather-more-or-less

Let 's ha ' done with abby-nay , kul , an ' hazar-ho
Mind you keep your rifle an ' yourself jus ' so

My certain shame to bear
I hear ! You do not care

Nice while it lasted , an ' now it is over
Tear out your heart an ' good-bye to your lover

What 's the use o ' grievin ' , when the mother that bore you
( Mary , pity women ! ) knew it all before you

An ' I 'm the ruined one
An ' now you 'll off an ' run

When a man is tired there is naught will bind him
All he solemn promised he will shove behind him

What 's the good o ' prayin ' for The Wrath to strike him
( Mary , pity women ! ) , when the rest are like him

But this -- but this is you
So help me Christ , it 's true

All the more you give 'em the less are they for givin
Love lies dead , an ' you can not kiss him livin

Down the road he led you there is no returnin
( Mary , pity women ! ) , but you 're late in learnin

We might , but ~this~ is shore
I want the name -- no more

What 's the good o ' pleadin ' , when the mother that bore you
( Mary , pity women ! ) knew it all before you

Sleep on his promises an ' wake to your sorrow
( Mary , pity women ! ) , for we sail to-morrow

When Earth 's last picture is painted and the tubes are twisted and dried
When the oldest colours have faded , and the youngest critic has died

We shall rest , and , faith , we shall need it -- lie down for an ] aeon or two
Till the Master of All Good Workmen shall put us to work anew

And those that were good shall be happy : they shall sit in a golden chair
They shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comets ' hair

They shall find real saints to draw from -- Magdalene , Peter , and Paul
They shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at all

And only the Master shall praise us , and only the Master shall blame
And no one shall work for money , and no one shall work for fame

But each for the joy of the working , and each , in his separate star
Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God of Things as They Are

Lord God of Hosts , be with us yet
Lest we forget -- lest we forget

Lord God of Hosts , be with us yet
Lest we forget -- lest we forget

Lord God of Hosts , be with us yet
Lest we forget -- lest we forget

Lord God of Hosts , be with us yet
Lest we forget -- lest we forget

For frantic boast and foolish word
Thy Mercy on Thy People , Lord

To a rag and a bone and a hank of hair
( We called her the woman who did not care

Belong to the woman who did not know
( And now we know that she never could know

Honor and faith and a sure intent
But a fool must follow his natural bent

Belong to the woman who did n't know why
( And now we know she never knew why

Which she might have seen when she threw him aside
( But it is n't on record the lady tried

It 's coming to know that she never knew why
( Seeing at last she could never know why

Will you conquer my heart with your beauty ; my soul going out from afar
Shall I fall to your hand as a victim of crafty and cautious shikar

Have I met you and passed you already , unknowing , unthinking and blind
Shall I meet you next session at Simla , O sweetest and best of your kind

Does the P. and O. bear you to meward , or , clad in short frocks in the West
Are you growing the charms that shall capture and torture the heart in my breast

Will you stay in the Plains till September -- my passion as warm as the day
Will you bring me to book on the Mountains , or where the thermantidotes play

When the light of your eyes shall make pallid the mean lesser lights I pursue
And the charm of your presence shall lure me from love of the gay `` thirteen-two

When the peg and the pig-skin shall please not ; when I buy me Calcutta-build clothes
When I quit the Delight of Wild Asses ; forswearing the swearing of oaths

As a deer to the hand of the hunter when I turn 'mid the gibes of my friends
When the days of my freedom are numbered , and the life of the bachelor ends

Ah , Goddess ! child , spinster , or widow -- as of old on Mars Hill whey they raised
To the God that they knew not an altar -- so I , a young Pagan , have praised

The Goddess I know not nor worship ; yet , if half that men tell me be true
You will come in the future , and therefore these verses are written to you

Now the New Year , reviving last Year 's Debt
The Thoughtful Fisher casteth wide his Net

Imports indeed are gone with all their Dues
Lo ! Salt a Lever that I dare not use

Pay -- and I promise by the Dust of Spring
Retrenchment . If my promises can bring

Indeed , indeed , Retrenchment oft before
I swore -- but did I mean it when I swore

Whether a Boileaugunge or Babylon
I know not how the wretched Thing is done

I can not help it . What have I to do
With One and Five , or Four , or Three , or Two

Behold , I promise -- Anything You will
Behold , I greet you with an empty Till

For if I sinned and fell , where lies the Gain
Of Knowledge ? Would it ease you of your Pain

`` Who hath not Prudence '' -- what was it I said
Of Her who paints her Eyes and tires Her Head

Accursed is She of Eve 's daughters -- She

The Singer generally sings
Of personal and private things

The very clever folk I sing to
Will most indubitably cling to

Sing , for Faith and Hope are high
None so true as you and I

Cross that rules the Southern Sky
Stars that sweep and wheel and fly

Side by side the horses fly

It was an artless Bandar , and he danced upon a pine
And much I wondered how he lived , and where the beast might dine

And many , many other things , till , o'er my morning smoke
I slept the sleep of idleness and dreamt that Bandar spoke

He said : `` O man of many clothes ! Sad crawler on the Hills
Observe , I know not Ranken 's shop , nor Ranken 's monthly bills

I take no heed to trousers or the coats that you call dress
Nor am I plagued with little cards for little drinks at Mess

`` I steal the bunnia 's grain at morn , at noon and eventide
( For he is fat and I am spare ) , I roam the mountain side

I follow no man 's carriage , and no , never in my life
Have I flirted at Peliti 's with another Bandar 's wife

`` O man of futile fopperies -- unnecessary wraps
I own no ponies in the hills , I drive no tall-wheeled traps

I buy me not twelve-button gloves , 'short-sixes ' eke , or rings
Nor do I waste at Hamilton 's my wealth on 'pretty things

`` I quarrel with my wife at home , we never fight abroad
But Mrs. B. has grasped the fact I am her only lord

I never heard of fever -- dumps nor debts depress my soul
And I pity and despise you ! '' Here he poached my breakfast-roll

His hide was very mangy , and his face was very red
And ever and anon he scratched with energy his head

His manners were not always nice , but how my spirit cried
To be an artless Bandar loose upon the mountain side

So I answered : `` Gentle Bandar , an inscrutable Decree
Makes thee a gleesome fleasome Thou , and me a wretched Me

Go ! Depart in peace , my brother , to thy home amid the pine
Yet forget not once a mortal wished to change his lot for thine

He smoked cigars , called churches slow
And raced -- but this she did not know

That Lilly -- thirteen-two and bay
Absorbed one-half her husband 's pay

He vexed her righteous soul until
She went up , and he went down hill

For Belial Machiavelli , I
Know Jane would just have let it lie

Ca n't understand why she is kept
At your expense . '' Jane Austen wept

Sent off that letter , wrote another
To her solicitor -- and mother

For Lilly -- thirteen-two and bay
Came in a horse-box all the way

She races now with Belial . This
Is very sad , but so it is

A fortnight fully to be missed
Behold , we lose our fourth at whist

Have bought his ponies , guns , and traps
His fortune is the Great Perhaps

Our mundane revel on the height
Shall watch each flashing 'rickshaw-light

With lighted rooms and braying band
And he shall hear and understand

Across Sanjaolie after rain
His soul may climb the hill again

The strong man 's yearning to his kind
Shall shake at most the window-blind

His Light o ' Love another 's flame
His dearest pony galloped lame

Shrewd shadows , lingering long unseen
Among us when `` God save the Queen

And , when at four the lights expire
The crew shall gather round the fire

Flirt wanly , dance in ghostly-wise
With ghosts of tunes for melodies

Youth was cheap -- wherefore we sold it
Gold was good -- we hoped to hold it

The toad beneath the harrow knows
Exactly where each tooth-point goes

The butterfly upon the road
Preaches contentment to that toad

Pagett , M.P. , was a liar , and a fluent liar therewith
He spoke of the heat of India as the `` Asian Solar Myth

Came on a four months ' visit , to `` study the East , '' in November
And I got him to sign an agreement vowing to stay till September

March came in with the koil . Pagett was cool and gay
Called me a `` bloated Brahmin , '' talked of my `` princely pay

March went out with the roses . `` Where is your heat ? '' said he
`` Coming , '' said I to Pagett , `` Skittles ! '' said Pagett , M.P

April began with the punkah , coolies , and prickly-heat
Pagett was dear to mosquitoes , sandflies found him a treat

He grew speckled and mumpy -- hammered , I grieve to say
Aryan brothers who fanned him , in an illiberal way

May set in with a dust-storm , -- Pagett went down with the sun
All the delights of the season tickled him one by one

Imprimis -- ten day 's `` liver '' -- due to his drinking beer
Later , a dose of fever -- slight , but he called it severe

Dysent'ry touched him in June , after the Chota Bursat
Lowered his portly person -- made him yearn to depart

He did n't call me a `` Brahmin , '' or `` bloated , '' or `` overpaid
But seemed to think it a wonder that any one stayed

July was a trifle unhealthy , -- Pagett was ill with fear
'Called it the `` Cholera Morbus , '' hinted that life was dear

He babbled of `` Eastern Exile , '' and mentioned his home with tears
But I have n't seen my children for close upon seven years

We reached a hundred and twenty once in the Court at noon
( I 've mentioned Pagett was portly ) Pagett , went off in a swoon

That was an end to the business ; Pagett , the perjured , fled
With a practical , working knowledge of `` Solar Myths '' in his head

And I laughed as I drove from the station , but the mirth died out on my lips
As I thought of the fools like Pagett who write of their `` Eastern trips

And the sneers of the traveled idiots who duly misgovern the land
And I prayed to the Lord to deliver another one into my hand

Free wind of March , against the lattice blowing
Bear thou our thanks , lest she depart unknowing

Out of our shadow pass , and seek her singing
`` I have no gifts but Love alone for bringing

For we have seen the light , and it were grievous
To dim that dawning if our lady leave us

By all the grey owl watched , the pale moon viewed
In past grim years , declare our gratitude

By ills foredone , by peace her toils discover
Bid Earth be good beneath and Heaven above her

Is it a little thing that she has wrought
Then Life and Death and Motherhood be nought

All spring shall give thee fragrance , and the wheat
Shall be a tasselled floorcloth to thy feet

Then very softly to her presence move
And whisper : `` Lady , lo , they know and love

Too late , alas ! the song
To remedy the wrong

But these tear-besprinkled pages
Shall attest to future ages

If you love me as I love you
What pair so happy as we two

If you love me as I love you
What knife can cut our love in two

If you love me as I love you
We 'll play the game and win it too

If you love me as I love you
What can Life kill or Death undo

If you love me as I love you
What knife can cut our love in two

If you love me as I love you
All Earth is servant to us two

If you love me as I love you
What pair so happy as we two

If It be pleasant to look on , stalled in the packed serai
Does not the Young Man try Its temper and pace ere he buy

If She be pleasant to look on , what does the Young Man say
`` Lo ! She is pleasant to look on , give Her to me today

Yea , though a Kafir die , to him is remitted Jehannum
If he borrowed in life from a native at sixty per cent . per annum

Blister we not for bursati ? So when the heart is vexed
The pain of one maiden 's refusal is drowned in the pain of the next

The temper of chums , the love of your wife , and a new piano 's tune
Which of the three will you trust at the end of an Indian June

Who are the rulers of Ind -- to whom shall we bow the knee
Make your peace with the women , and men will make you L. G

Does the woodpecker flit round the young ferash ? Does grass clothe a new-built wall
Is she under thirty , the woman who holds a boy in her thrall

If She grow suddenly gracious -- reflect . Is it all for thee
The black-buck is stalked through the bullock , and Man through jealousy

Seek not for favor of women . So shall you find it indeed
Does not the boar break cover just when you 're lighting a weed

If He play , being young and unskilful , for shekels of silver and gold
Take his money , my son , praising Allah . The kid was ordained to be sold

With a `` weed '' among men or horses verily this is the best
That you work him in office or dog-cart lightly -- but give him no rest

Pleasant the snaffle of Courtship , improving the manners and carriage
But the colt who is wise will abstain from the terrible thorn-bit of Marriage

As the thriftless gold of the babul , so is the gold that we spend
On a derby Sweep , or our neighbor 's wife , or the horse that we buy from a friend

The ways of man with a maid be strange , yet simple and tame
To the ways of a man with a horse , when selling or racing that same

In public Her face turneth to thee , and pleasant Her smile when ye meet
It is ill . The cold rocks of El-Gidar smile thus on the waves at their feet

In public Her face is averted , with anger . She nameth thy name
It is well . Was there ever a loser content with the loss of the game

If She have spoken a word , remember thy lips are sealed
And the Brand of the Dog is upon him by whom is the secret revealed

If She have written a letter , delay not an instant , but burn it
Tear it to pieces , O Fool , and the wind to her mate shall return it

If there be trouble to Herward , and a lie of the blackest can clear
Lie , while thy lips can move or a man is alive to hear

My Son , if a maiden deny thee and scufflingly bid thee give o'er
Yet lip meets with lip at the last word -- get out ! She has been there before

If we fall in the race , though we win , the hoof-slide is scarred on the course
Though Allah and Earth pardon Sin , remaineth forever Remorse

`` By all I am misunderstood ! '' if the Matron shall say , or the Maid
`` Alas ! I do not understand , '' my son , be thou nowise afraid

My son , if I , Hafiz , the father , take hold of thy knees in my pain
Demanding thy name on stamped paper , one day or one hour -- refrain

For the Burmans said
That a kullah 's head

Let the robber retreat -- let the tiger turn tail
In the Name of the Empress , the Overland Mail

`` Despatched on this date , as received by the rail
Per runner , two bags of the Overland Mail

While the breath 's in his mouth , he must bear without fail
In the Name of the Empress , the Overland Mail

From rail to ravine -- to the peak from the vale
Up , up through the night goes the Overland Mail

For the great Sun himself must attend to the hail
`` In the name of the Empress the Overland Mail

By the well , where the bullocks go
Silent and blind and slow

By the field where the young corn dies
In the face of the sultry skies

Great serpents , blazing , of red and blue
That rose and faded , and rose anew

And the Ploughman listened and bowed his head
`` Today and tomorrow God 's will , '' he said

The eldest son bestrides him
And the pretty daughter rides him

And there kindles in my bosom
An emotion chill and gruesome

Neither shies he nor is restive
But a hideously suggestive

And the cadence of his hoof-beats
To my mind this grim reproof beats

Ah ! stud-bred of ill-omen
I have watched the strongest go -- men

Down the plantain-bordered highway
( Heaven send it ne'er be my way

Answer , sombre beast and dreary
Where is Brown , the young , the cheery

You were at that last dread dak
We must cover at a walk

With your mane unhogged and flowing
And your curious way of going

E'en with Beauty on your back , Sir
Pacing as a lady 's hack , Sir

It may be you wait your time , Beast
Till I write my last bad rhyme , Beast

Follow after with the others
Where some dusky heathen smothers

Or , perchance , in years to follow
I shall watch your plump sides hollow

See old age at last o'erpower you
And the Station Pack devour you

But to insult , jibe , and quest , I 've
Still the hideously suggestive

And I hear it hard behind me
In what place soe'er I find me

The flying bullet down the Pass
That whistles clear : `` All flesh is grass

And after -- ask the Yusufzaies
What comes of all our 'ologies

The Crammer 's boast , the Squadron 's pride
Shot like a rabbit in a ride

Strike hard who cares -- shoot straight who can
The odds are on the cheaper man

But , being blessed with perfect sight
Picks off our messmates left and right

The `` captives of our bow and spear
Are cheap -- alas ! as we are dear

Open the old cigar-box , get me a Cuba stout
For things are running crossways , and Maggie and I are out

We quarrelled about Havanas -- we fought o'er a good cheroot
And I knew she is exacting , and she says I am a brute

Open the old cigar-box -- let me consider a space
In the soft blue veil of the vapour musing on Maggie 's face

Maggie is pretty to look at -- Maggie 's a loving lass
But the prettiest cheeks must wrinkle , the truest of loves must pass

There 's peace in a Larranaga , there 's calm in a Henry Clay
But the best cigar in an hour is finished and thrown away

Thrown away for another as perfect and ripe and brown
But I could not throw away Maggie for fear o ' the talk o ' the town

Maggie , my wife at fifty -- grey and dour and old
With never another Maggie to purchase for love or gold

And the light of Days that have Been the dark of the Days that Are
And Love 's torch stinking and stale , like the butt of a dead cigar

The butt of a dead cigar you are bound to keep in your pocket
With never a new one to light tho ' it 's charred and black to the socket

Open the old cigar-box -- let me consider a while
Here is a mild Manila -- there is a wifely smile

Which is the better portion -- bondage bought with a ring
Or a harem of dusky beauties , fifty tied in a string

Counsellors cunning and silent -- comforters true and tried
And never a one of the fifty to sneer at a rival bride

Thought in the early morning , solace in time of woes
Peace in the hush of the twilight , balm ere my eyelids close

This will the fifty give me , asking nought in return
With only a Suttee 's passion -- to do their duty and burn

This will the fifty give me . When they are spent and dead
Five times other fifties shall be my servants instead

The furrows of far-off Java , the isles of the Spanish Main
When they hear my harem is empty will send me my brides again

I will take no heed to their raiment , nor food for their mouths withal
So long as the gulls are nesting , so long as the showers fall

I will scent 'em with best vanilla , with tea will I temper their hides
And the Moor and the Mormon shall envy who read of the tale of my brides

For Maggie has written a letter to give me my choice between
The wee little whimpering Love and the great god Nick o ' Teen

And I have been servant of Love for barely a twelvemonth clear
But I have been Priest of Cabanas a matter of seven year

And the gloom of my bachelor days is flecked with the cheery light
Of stumps that I burned to Friendship and Pleasure and Work and Fight

And I turn my eyes to the future that Maggie and I must prove
But the only light on the marshes is the Will-o'-the-Wisp of Love

Will it see me safe through my journey or leave me bogged in the mire
Since a puff of tobacco can cloud it , shall I follow the fitful fire

Open the old cigar-box -- let me consider anew
Old friends , and who is Maggie that I should abandon you

A million surplus Maggies are willing to bear the yoke
And a woman is only a woman , but a good Cigar is a Smoke

Light me another Cuba -- I hold to my first-sworn vows
If Maggie will have no rival , I 'll have no Maggie for Spouse

Where the sober-colored cultivator smiles
On his byles

Where the cholera , the cyclone , and the crow
Come and go

Where the merchant deals in indigo and tea
Hides and ghi

Where the Babu drops inflammatory hints
In his prints

Stands a City -- Charnock chose it -- packed away
Near a Bay

By the Sewage rendered fetid , by the sewer
Made impure

By the Sunderbunds unwholesome , by the swamp
Moist and damp

And the City and the Viceroy , as we see
Do n't agree

Once , two hundred years ago , the trader came
Meek and tame

Where his timid foot first halted , there he stayed
Till mere trade

Grew to Empire , and he sent his armies forth
South and North

Till the country from Peshawur to Ceylon
Was his own

Thus the midday halt of Charnock -- more 's the pity
Grew a City

As the fungus sprouts chaotic from its bed
So it spread

Chance-directed , chance-erected , laid and built
On the silt

Palace , byre , hovel -- poverty and pride
Side by side

And , above the packed and pestilential town
Death looked down

But the Rulers in that City by the Sea
Turned to flee

Fled , with each returning spring-tide from its ills
To the Hills

From the clammy fogs of morning , from the blaze
Of old days

From the sickness of the noontide , from the heat
Beat retreat

For the country from Peshawur to Ceylon
Was their own

But the Merchant risked the perils of the Plain
For his gain

Now the resting-place of Charnock , 'neath the palms
Asks an alms

And the burden of its lamentation is
Briefly , this

`` Because for certain months , we boil and stew
So should you

Cast the Viceroy and his Council , to perspire
In our fire

And for answer to the argument , in vain
We explain

That an amateur Saint Lawrence can not fry
`` All must fry

That the Merchant risks the perils of the Plain
For gain

Nor can Rulers rule a house that men grow rich in
From its kitchen

Let the Babu drop inflammatory hints
In his prints

And mature -- consistent soul -- his plan for stealing
To Darjeeling

Let the Merchant seek , who makes his silver pile
England 's isle

Let the City Charnock pitched on -- evil day
Go Her way

Now mount the theater of this our age
To plead my faith and Cupid 's cursed rage

Shroud with your mighty wings that mount so well
These little loves , new crept from out the shell

Who from the wrastling waves have made retreat
To plead for life before thy judgment seat

Yet these I hope , under your kind aspect
Most worthy Lady , shall escape neglect

Shall hatch such breed in honour of thy name
As modern poets shall admire the same

I mean the mean , I mean no men divine
But such whose feathers are but waxed like mine

You are but mists before so bright a sun
Who hath the palm for deep invention won

Then lay you down in Phillis ' lap and sleep
Until the weeping read , and reading weep

Show to the world though poor and scant my skill is
How sweet thoughts be , that are but thought on Phillis

May prattle in the north in Phillis ' ears
`` Where Phillis wants , Damon consumes in tears

Yet she who claims the title of world 's wonder
Thinks all deserts too base to bring her under

None writes with truer faith , or greater love
Yet out , alas ! I have no power to move

Let my heart 's heat and cold , thy crimson nourish
And by my sorrows let thy beauty flourish

Since she who holds my heart and me in durance
Hath life , death , love and all in her procurance

And I , -- oh would I might , or would she meant it
Should hery [ A ] love , who now in heart lament it

But when I touch and taste as others do
I then shall write and you shall wonder too

A three-days ' stormy tempest did maintain
Her shame a fire , her eyes a swelling rain

As love hath wreaths his pretty eyes to seel
So lovers must keep secret what they feel

Hath sailed these worldly seas with small avail
Vain objects serve for dreadful rocks to quail

My brittle boat from haven of life that flies
To haunt the sea of mundane miseries

But lawless will enflamed with endless ire
Doth steer empoop , [ B ] whilst reason doth retire

The streams increase ; love 's waves my bark do fill
Thus are they wracked that guide their course by will

But if thou do not love , I 'll truly serve her
In spite of thee , and by firm faith deserve her

But , out alas ! so fell is Phillis fearless
That she hath made her Damon well nigh tearless

Sweet sun , when thou look'st on
Pray her regard my moan

Sweet birds , when you sing to her
To yield some pity woo her

Sweet flowers , whenas she treads on
Tell her , her beauty deads one

And if in life her love she nill agree me
Pray her before I die , she will come see me

Oh ceaseless pains that never may be told
You make me weep as I to water would

All traitorous eyes , to [ o ] feeble in for [ e ] sight
Grow dim with woe , that now must want your light

I part -- oh death ! for why ? this world contains
More care and woe than with despair remains

Oh loath depart , wherein such sorrows dwell
As all conceits are scant the same to tell

That in one moment giv'st me joy and pain
How do my hopes dissolve to tears in vain

As wont the snows , 'fore angry sun to weep
Ah noisome life that hath no weal in keep

My forward grief hath form and working might
My pleasures like the shadows take their flight

Where thou fond dream my longed weal defacest
Whilst fleeting and uncertain shades thou placest

Ah instant sweets which do my heart revive
How should I joy if you were true alive

So that both cold and heat do rather feed
My ceaseless pains , than any comfort breed

She might perceive how much she might command
That had my life and death within her hand

And could my style her happy virtues equal
Time had no power her glories to enthral

Unneth thy flocks may feed to see thee faint
Thou lost , they lean , and both with woe attaint

And let advice rear up thy drooping mind
And leave to weep thy woes unto the wind

Even so a saint more sun-bright in her shining
First wrought my weal , now hastes my winter 's pining

For pity scorn the spring that nigheth near
And pine to see their master 's pining cheer

And that fair eye that lights this earthly ball
Kills by depart , and nearing cheereth all

Which heavenly eye that lights both earth and air
Quells by depart and quickens by repair

And as kind time keeps Phillis from thy sight
So let prevention banish fancy quite

Drive hence vain thoughts which are fond love 's abettors
For he that seeks his thraldom merits fetters

And so thou list , thou may as soon forget love
As thou at first didst fashion and beget love

Where chilly age first left love , and first lost her
There youth found love , liked love , and love did foster

We know you loved , and loving learn that lore
You scorn kind love , because you can no more

Then still the swain , for I will still avow it
They have no wit nor worth that disallow it

Mourn sheep , mourn lambs , and Damon will weep by you
And when I sigh , `` Come home , sweet Phillis , '' cry you

Shut in their buds , their beauties , and bemoan them
Because my Phillis doth not smile upon them

They have new liveries with each smile thou lendest
And droop with me , when thy fair brow thou bendest

Come home , and glad our meads of winter weary
And make thy woeful Damon blithe and merry

And cry such cries as love that hears my crying
Shall faint and weep for grief and fall a-dying

I fear it , Phillis , for he never saw one
That had more heaven-sweet looks to lure and awe one

All hope ( but future hope to be renowned
For weeping Phillis ) shall in tears be drowned

For time shall come when Phillis is interred
That Damon shall confess that he hath erred

Thou wert so fond , since Phillis was so frail
To praise her gifts that should so quickly fail

If Phillis love , love her , yet love her so
That if she fly , thou may'st love 's fire forego

Play with these babes of love , as apes with glasses
And put no trust in feathers , wind , or lasses

Spring flowers , sea-tides , earth , grass , sky , stars shall banish
Before the thoughts of love or Phillis vanish

Light-flying fowls , the posts of night , disport them
And cheerful-looking vesper doth consort them

Vouchsafe his message that doth bring farewell
And for my sake let him with beauty dwell

What if they do ? They shall but feed the fire
Which I have kindled by my fond desire

Yet natheless though wondrous gifts you call these
My faith is far more wonderful than all these

In such extremes what wretch can cease to crave
His peace from death , who can no mercy have

For why ? She sorts her frowns and favours so
As when I gain or lose I can not know

So that I grieve when I enjoy your presence
And die for grief by reason of your absence

Yea , such a power is love , whose loss is pain
And having got him we repent our gain

Look sweet , since from the pith of contemplation
Love gathereth life , and living , breedeth passion

And should I leave thee then , thou pretty elf
Nay , first let Damon quite forget himself

Which death shall dwell with me and never fly
Since vain desire seeks that hope doth deny

Which always bides within thy flow'ring prime
The month of April , that bedews our clime

Before his face the doly season fleets
Mild been his looks , thine eyes are full of sweets

He paints the fields through liquid crystal showers
Thou paint'st my verse with Pallas , learned flowers

And thou my heart with weeping sighs dost wring
His brows are dewed with morning 's crystal spring

I walk and chase a savage fairy still
Now near the flood , straight on the mounting hill

For brach I lead an over-forward mind
My hounds are thoughts , and rage despairing blind

My flying fairy can not overtake
With open mouths their prey on me do make

And full of fury on their master feed
To hasten on my hapless death with speed

To hope for all , yet for despair to die
Is of my life the certain destiny

Young Love , his bow , and Thetis gave her feet
Clio her praise , Pallas her science sweet

With tempting showers in pleasant sort descend
Into fair Phillis ' lap , my lovely friend

When midst the gladsome fields she should appear
By pleasant fineness to surprise my dear

To be Narsissus so she were a spring
To drown in her those woes my heart do wring

That whilst I thus in pleasure 's lap did lie
I might refresh desire , which else would die

And for my love I am bereft of power
And strengthless strive my weakness to devour

In brief , the cruel god doth never from me go
But makes my lasting love eternal with my woe

Which show the certain proof of my ne'er-ceasing pains
Fair Phillis , are no tears that trickle from my brains

For why ? Such streams of ruth within me find no place
These floods that wet my cheeks are gathered from thy grace

And thy perfections , and from hundred thousand flowers
Which from thy beauties spring ; whereto I medley showers

The aperries of my sighs augment the burning flame
The limbec is mine eye that doth distil the same

And by how much my fire is violent and sly
By so much doth it cause the waters mount on high

From day to day is changed in sundry sort
The proof whereof myself may well report

That bare the bloody arrow in my side
Then to a swan that midst the waters glide

Then was I made a fountain sudden dry
Distilling all my tears from troubled eye

Living in flames , but hope ere long to be
A voice , to talk my mistress ' majesty

Each stalk whilst forth she stalks , to kiss her feet
Is proud with pomp , and prodigal of sweet

Where Love did couch by summer toil suppressed
And sought his sleeps within so sweet a nest

The lad that felt the soft and sweet so nigh
Drowned in delights , disdains his liberty

This said , he sucked , my mistress blushing smiled
Since Love was both her prisoner and her child

Now I find thy looks were feigned
Quickly lost , and quickly gained

Soft thy skin , like wool of wethers
Heart unstable , light as feathers

Tongue untrusty , subtile-sighted
Wanton will , with change delighted

Siren pleasant , foe to reason
Cupid plague thee for this treason

Of thine eyes , I made my mirror
From thy beauty came mine error

All thy words I counted witty
All thy smiles I deemed pity

Thy false tears that me aggrieved
First of all my trust deceived

Siren pleasant , foe to reason
Cupid plague thee for this treason

Feigned acceptance when I asked
Lovely words with cunning masked

Holy vows but heart unholy
Wretched man , my trust was folly

Lily white and pretty winking
Solemn vows , but sorry thinking

Siren pleasant , foe to reason
Cupid plague thee for this treason

Now I see , O seemly cruel
Others warm them at my fuel

Wit shall guide me in this durance
Since in love is no assurance

Change thy pasture , take thy pleasure
Beauty is a fading treasure

Siren pleasant , foe to reason
Cupid plague thee for this treason

Prime youth lusts not age still follow
And make white these tresses yellow

Wrinkled face for looks delightful
Shall acquaint the dame despightful

And when time shall eat thy glory
Then too late thou wilt be sorry

Siren pleasant , foe to reason
Cupid plague thee for thy treason

Homer hath vowed , and I with him do vow this
He will and shall revive , if you allow this

To the richest Treasury
That e'er fill 'd ambitious eye

To the faire bright Magazin
Hath impoverisht Love 's Queen

To th ' Exchequer of all honour
( All take pensions but from her

To the taper of the thore
Which the god himselfe but bore

To the Sea of Chaste Delight
Let me cast the Drop I write

And as at Loretto 's shrine
Caesar shovels in his mine

Th ' Empres spreads her carkanets
The lords submit their coronets

Knights their chased armes hang by
Maids diamond-ruby fancies tye

Whilst from the pilgrim she wears
One poore false pearl , but ten true tears

So among the Orient prize
( Saphyr-onyx eulogies

Offer 'd up unto your fame
Take my GARNET-DUBLET name

And vouchsafe 'midst those rich joyes
( With devotion ) these TOYES

Now y ' have oblieg 'd the age , thy wel known worth
Is to our joy auspiciously brought forth

Good morrow to thy son , thy first borne flame
Which , as thou gav'st it birth , stamps it a name

That Fate and a discerning age shall set
The chiefest jewell in her coronet

Why then needs all this paines , those season 'd pens
That standing lifeguard to a booke ( kinde friends

That with officious care thus guard thy gate
As if thy Child were illigitimate

Forgive their freedome , since unto their praise
They write to give , not to dispute thy bayes

As when some glorious queen , whose pregnant wombe
Brings forth a kingdome with her first-borne Sonne

Marke but the subjects joyfull hearts and eyes
Some offer gold , and others sacrifice

This slayes a lambe , that , not so rich as hee
Brings but a dove , this but a bended knee

And though their giftes be various , yet their sence
Speaks only this one thought , Long live the prince

So , my best brother , if unto your name
I offer up a thin blew-burning flame

Pardon my love , since none can make thee shine
Vnlesse they kindle first their torch at thine

Then as inspir 'd , they boldly write , nay that
Which their amazed lights but twinkl 'd at

And their illustrate thoughts doe voice this right
Lucasta held their torch ; thou gav'st it light

How humble is thy muse ( Deare ) that can daign
Such servants as my pen to entertaine

When all the sonnes of wit glory to be
Clad in thy muses gallant livery

I shall disgrace my master , prove a staine
And no addition to his honour 'd traine

Though all that read me will presume to swear
I neer read thee : yet if it may appear

I love the writer and admire the writ
I my owne want betray , not wrong thy wit

Did thy worke want a prayse , my barren brain
Could not afford it : my attempt were vaine

It needs no foyle : All that ere writ before
Are foyles to thy faire Poems , and no more

Then to be lodg 'd in the same sheets with thine
May prove disgrace to yours , but grace to mine

Deare Lovelace , I am now about to prove
I can not write a verse , but can write love

On such a subject as thy booke I cooed
Write books much greater , but not half so good

But as the humble tenant , that does bring
A chicke or egges for 's offering

Is tane into the buttry , and does fox
Equall with him that gave a stalled oxe

So ( since the heart of ev'ry cheerfull giver
Makes pounds no more accepted than a stiver

Though som thy prayse in rich stiles sing , I may
In stiver-stile write love as well as they

I write so well that I no criticks feare
For who'le read mine , when as thy booke 's so neer

Vnlesse thy selfe ? then you shall secure mine
From those , and Ile engage my selfe for thine

They ' l do't themselves ; < thee > this allay you ' l take
I love thy book , and yet not for thy sake

So from the pregnant braine of Jove did rise
Pallas , the queene of wit and beautious eyes

As faire Lucasta from thy temples flowes
Temples no lesse ingenious then Joves

Alike in birth , so shall she be in fame
And be immortall to preserve thy Name

Now , when the wars augment our woes and fears
And the shrill noise of drums oppresse our ears

Now peace and safety from our shores are fled
To holes and cavernes to secure their head

Now all the graces from the land are sent
And the nine Muses suffer banishment

Whence spring these raptures ? whence this heavenly rime
So calme and even in so harsh a time

Well might that charmer his faire Caelia crowne
And that more polish't Tyterus renowne

His Sacarissa , when in groves and bowres
They could repose their limbs on beds of flowrs

When wit had prayse , and merit had reward
And every noble spirit did accord

To love the Muses , and their priests to raise
And interpale their browes with flourishing bayes

But in a time distracted so to sing
When peace is hurried hence on rages wing

When the fresh bayes are from the Temple torne
And every art and science made a scorne

Then to raise up , by musicke of thy art
Our drooping spirits and our grieved hearts

Then to delight our souls , and to inspire
Our breast with pleasure from thy charming lyre

Then to divert our sorrowes by thy straines
Making us quite forget our seven yeers paines

In the past wars , unlesse that Orpheus be
A sharer in thy glory : for when he

He stroke his lute with like admired art
And made the damned to forget their smart

He that doth paint the beauties of your verse
Must use your pensil , be polite , soft , terse

Forgive that man whose best of art is love
If he no equall master to you prove

My heart is all my eloquence , and that
Speaks sharp affection , when my words fall flat

I reade you like my mistresse , and discry
In every line the quicknesse of her eye

Her smoothnesse in each syllable , her grace
To marshall ev'ry word in the right place

It is the excellence and soule of wit
When ev'ry thing is free as well as fit

For metaphors packt up and crowded close
Swath < ye > minds sweetnes , and display the throws

And , like those chickens hatcht in furnaces
Produce or one limbe more , or one limbe lesse

Then nature bids . Survey such when they write
No clause but 's justl 'd with an epithite

So powerfully you draw when you perswade
Passions in you in us are vertues made

Such is the magick of that lawfull shell
That where it doth but talke , it doth compell

For no Apelles 'till this time e 're drew
A Venus to the waste so well as you

The world shall now no longer mourne nor vex
For th ' obliquity of a cross-grain 'd sex

Nor beauty swell above her bankes , ( and made
For ornament ) the universe invade

So fiercely , that 't is question 'd in our bookes
Whether kils most the Amazon 's sword or lookes

Lucasta in loves game discreetly makes
Women and men joyntly to share the stakes

And lets us know , when women scorne , it is
Mens hot love makes the antiparisthesis

And a lay lover here such comfort finds
As Holy Writ gives to affected minds

The wilder nymphs , lov 's power could not comand
Are by thy almighty numbers brought to hand

And flying Daphnes , caught , amazed vow
They never heard Apollo court till now

'T is not by force of armes this feat is done
For that would puzzle even the Knight o ' th ' Sun

But 't is by pow ' r of art , and such a way
As Orpheus us 'd , when he made fiends obay

Ovr times are much degenerate from those
Which your sweet Muse , which your fair fortune chose

And as complexions alter with the climes
Our wits have drawne th ' infection of our times

That candid age no other way could tell
To be ingenious , but by speaking well

Who best could prayse , had then the greatest prayse
'T was more esteemd to give then wear the bayes

Modest ambition studi 'd only then
To honour not her selfe , but worthy men

These vertues now are banisht out of towne
Our Civill Wars have lost the civicke crowne

He highest builds , who with most art destroys
And against others fame his owne employs

I see the envious caterpillar sit
On the faire blossome of each growing wit

The ayre 's already tainted with the swarms
Of insects , which against you rise in arms

Word-peckers , paper-rats , book-scorpions
Of wit corrupted the unfashion 'd sons

The barbed censurers begin to looke
Like the grim Consistory on thy booke

And on each line cast a reforming eye
Severer then the yong presbytery

Till , when in vaine they have thee all perused
You shall for being faultlesse be accused

Some reading your LUCASTA will alledge
You wrong 'd in her the Houses priviledge

Some that you under sequestration are
Because you write when going to the Warre

And one the book prohibits , because Kent
Their first Petition by the Authour sent

But when the beauteous ladies came to know
That their deare Lovelace was endanger 'd so

Lovelace , that thaw 'd the most congealed brest
He who lov 'd best , and them defended best

Whose hand so rudely grasps the steely brand
Whose hand so gently melts the ladies hand

They all in mutiny , though yet undrest
Sally 'd , and would in his defence contest

And one , the loveliest that was yet e 're seen
Thinking that I too of the rout had been

Mine eyes invaded with a female spight
( She knew what pain 't would be to lose that sight

O no , mistake not , I reply 'd : for I
In your defence , or in his cause , would dy

But he , secure of glory and of time
Above their envy or mine aid doth clime

Him valianst men and fairest nymphs approve
His booke in them finds judgement , with you , love

If the desire of glory speak a mind
More nobly operative and more refined

What vast soule moves thee , or what hero 's spirit
( Kept in'ts traduction pure ) dost thou inherit

That , not contented with one single fame
Dost to a double glory spread thy name

And on thy happy temples safely set
Both th ' Delphick wreath and civic coronet

Was't not enough for us to know how far
Thou couldst in season suffer , act and dare

But we must also witnesse , with what height
And what Ionick sweetnesse thou canst write

And melt those eager passions , that are
Stubborn enough t ' enrage the god of war

Into a noble love , which may expire
In an illustrious pyramid of fire

Which , having gained his due station , may
Fix there , and everlasting flames display

This is the braver path : time soone can smother
The dear-bought spoils and tropheis of the other

How many fiery heroes have there been
Whose triumphs were as soone forgot as seen

Because they wanted some diviner one
To rescue < thee > from night , and make < thee > known

Such art thou to thy selfe . While others dream
Strong flatt'ries on a fain 'd or borrow 'd theam

Thou shalt remaine in thine owne lustre bright
And adde unto 't LUCASTA 'S chaster light

For none so fit to sing great things as he
That can act o 're all lights of poetry

Thus had Achilles his owne gests designed
He had his genius Homer far outshined

Poets and painters have some near relation
Compar 'd with fancy and imagination

The one paints shadowed persons ( in pure kind
The other paints the pictures of the mind

In purer verse . And as rare Zeuxes fame
Shin 'd , till Apelles art eclips 'd the same

By a more exquisite and curious line
In Zeuxeses ( with pensill far more fine

So have our modern poets late done well
Till thine appear 'd ( which scarce have paralel

They like to Zeuxes grapes beguile the sense
But thine do ravish the intelligence

Like the rare banquet of Apelles , drawn
And covered over with most curious lawn

Thus if thy careles draughts are cal 'd the best
What would thy lines have beene , had'st thou profest

That faculty ( infus 'd ) of poetry
Which adds such honour unto thy chivalry

Doubtles thy verse had all as far transcended
As Sydneyes Prose , who Poets once defended

For when I read thy much renowned pen
My fancy there finds out another Ben

In thy brave language , judgement , wit , and art
Of every piece of thine , in every part

Where thy seraphique Sydneyan fire is raised high
In valour , vertue , love , and loyalty

Virgil was styl 'd the loftiest of all
Ovid the smoothest and most naturall

Martiall concise and witty , quaint and pure
Iuvenall grave and learned , though obscure

But all these rare ones which I heere reherse
Do live againe in Thee , and in thy Verse

Although not in the language of their time
Yet in a speech as copious and sublime

The rare Apelles in thy picture wee
Perceive , and in thy soule Apollo see

Wel may each Grace and Muse then crown thy praise
With Mars his banner and Minerva 's bayes

Chast as Creation meant us , and more bright
Then the first day in 's uneclipsed light

Is thy LUCASTA ; and thou offerest heere
Lines to her name as undefil 'd and cleere

Such as the first indeed more happy dayes
( When vertue , wit , and learning wore the bayes

Now vice assumes ) would to her memory give
A Vestall flame that should for ever live

Plac't in a christal temple , rear 'd to be
The Embleme of her thoughts integrity

And on the porch thy name insculpt , my friend
Whose love , like to the flame , can know no end

The marble step that to the alter brings
The hallowed priests with their clean offerings

Shall hold their names that humbly crave to be
Votaries to th ' shrine , and grateful friends to thee

So shal we live ( although our offrings prove
Meane to the world ) for ever by thy love

Ile doe my nothing too , and try
To dabble to thy memory

Not that I offer to thy name
Encomiums of thy lasting fame

Those by the landed have been writ
Mine 's but a yonger-brother wit

A wit that 's hudled up in scarres
Borne like my rough selfe in the warres

And as a Squire in the fight
Serves only to attend the Knight

So 't is my glory in this field
Where others act , to beare thy shield

If to be absent were to be
Away from thee

Or that when I am gone
You or I were alone

Then my LUCASTA might I crave
Pity from blustring winde or swallowing wave

But I'le not sigh one blast or gale
To swell my saile

Or pay a teare to swage
The foaming blew-gods rage

For whether he will let me passe
Or no , I 'm still as happy as I was

Though seas and land betwixt us both
Our faith and troth

Like separated soules
All time and space controules

Above the highest sphere wee meet
Unseene , unknowne , and greet as angels greet

So then we doe anticipate
Our after-fate

And are alive i'th ' skies
If thus our lips and eyes

Can speake like spirits unconfined
In Heav'n , their earthy bodies left behind

Which shines with more delight
For gazing on that light

Indians smell not their neast
A Swisse or Finne tastes best

And , heav'nly Sydney you
Twice read , had rather view

This knew the wisest , who
From Juno stole , below

Amarantha sweet and faire
Ah brade no more that shining haire

As my curious hand or eye
Hovering round thee , let it flye

Let it flye as unconfined
As it 's calme ravisher , the winde

Who hath left his darling , th ' East
To wanton o 're that spicie neast

Ev'ry tresse must be confest
But neatly tangled at the best

Like a clue of golden thread
Most excellently ravelled

Doe not then winde up that light
In ribands , and o'er-cloud in night

Like the sun in 's early ray
But shake your head , and scatter day

See , 't is broke ! within this grove
The bower and the walkes of love

Weary lye we downe and rest
And fanne each other 's panting breast

Heere wee 'll strippe and coole our fire
In creame below , in milk-baths higher

And when all wells are drawne dry
I 'll drink a teare out of thine eye

Which our very joys shall leave
That sorrowes thus we can deceive

Or our very sorrowes weepe
That joyes so ripe so little keepe

Depose your finger of that ring
And crowne mine with't awhile

Now I restor't . Pray , dos it bring
Back with it more of soile

Or shines it not as innocent
As honest , as before 't was lent

So then inrich me with that treasure
'Twill but increase your store

And please me ( faire one ) with that pleasure
Must please you still the more

Not to save others is a curse
The blackest , when y'are ne 're the worse

Sweet serene skye-like flower
Haste to adorn her bower

From thy long clowdy bed
Shoot forth thy damaske head

New-startled blush of FLORA
The griefe of pale AURORA

Who will contest no more
Haste , haste , to strowe her floore

Vermilion ball , that 's given
From lip to lip in Heaven

Loves couches cover-led
Haste , haste , to make her bed

Dear offspring of pleas 'd VENUS
And jollie plumpe SILENUS

Haste , haste , to decke the haire
Of th ' only sweetly faire

See ! rosie is her bower
Her floore is all this flower

Her bed a rosie nest
By a bed of roses prest

But early as she dresses
Why fly you her bright tresses

Ah ! I have found , I feare
Because her cheekes are neere

Yon ' weeping , kissing , smiling pair
I'le scatter all their vowes i ' th ' ayr

At her constant marble heart
He drawes his swiftest surest dart

Triumphant she , refuses , scornes
He submits , adores and mournes

He weeping kneel 'd , and made a vow
The world shall love as yon ' fast two

Heark ! Oh heark ! you guilty trees
In whose gloomy galleries

Was the cruell'st murder done
That e 're yet eclipst the sunne

Be then henceforth in your twigges
Blasted , e 're you sprout to sprigges

Feele no season of the yeere
But what shaves off all your haire

Nor carve any from your wombes
Ought but coffins and their tombes

When I by thy faire shape did sweare
And mingled with each vowe a teare

I lov 'd , I lov 'd thee best
I swore as I profest

For all the while you lasted warme and pure
My oathes too did endure

But once turn 'd faithlesse to thy selfe and old
They then with thee incessantly grew cold

I swore my selfe thy sacrifice
By th ' ebon bowes that guard thine eyes

Which now are alter 'd white
And by the glorious light

Of both those stars , which of their spheres bereft
Only the gellie 's left

Then changed thus , no more I 'm bound to you
Then swearing to a saint that proves untrue

Long in thy shackels , liberty
I ask not from these walls , but thee

Left for awhile anothers bride
To fancy all the world beside

Yet e 're I doe begin to love
See , how I all my objects prove

Then my free soule to that confine
'Twere possible I might call mine

First I would be in love with PEACE
And her rich swelling breasts increase

But how , alas ! how may that be
Despising earth , she will love me

Faine would I be in love with WAR
As my deare just avenging star

But War is lov 'd so ev'rywhere
Ev'n he disdaines a lodging here

Thee and thy wounds I would bemoane
Faire thorough-shot RELIGION

But he lives only that kills thee
And who so bindes thy hands , is free

I would love a PARLIAMENT
As a maine prop from Heav'n sent

But ah ! who 's he , that would be wedded
To th ' fairest body that 's beheaded

Next would I court my LIBERTY
And then my birth-right , PROPERTY

But can that be , when it is knowne
There 's nothing you can call your owne

A REFORMATION I would have
As for our griefes a SOV'RAIGNE salve

That is , a cleansing of each wheele
Of state , that yet some rust doth feele

But not a reformation so
As to reforme were to ore'throw

Like watches by unskilfull men
Disjoynted , and set ill againe

The PUBLICK FAITH I would adore
But she is banke-rupt of her store

Nor how to trust her can I see
For she that couzens all , must me

Since then none of these can be
Fit objects for my love and me

What then remaines , but th ' only spring
Of all our loves and joyes , the King

He who , being the whole ball
Of day on earth , lends it to all

When seeking to ecclipse his right
Blinded we stand in our owne light

And now an universall mist
Of error is spread or ' e each breast

With such a fury edg 'd as is
Not found in th ' inwards of th ' abysse

Oh , from thy glorious starry waine
Dispense on me one sacred beame

To light me where I soone may see
How to serve you , and you trust me

Ah LUCASTA , why so bright
Spread with early streaked light

If still vailed from our sight
What is't but eternall night

Ah LUCASTA , why so chaste
With that vigour , ripenes grac't

Not to be by Man imbrac't
Makes that Royall coyne imbace't

Ah LUCASTA , why so great
That thy crammed coffers sweat

Yet not owner of a seat
May shelter you from Natures heat

Ah Lucasta , why so good
Blest with an unstained flood

Flowing both through soule and blood
If it be not understood

LUCASTA ! stay ! why dost thou flye
Thou art not bright but to the eye

Nor chaste but in the mariage-tye
Nor great but in this treasurie

Harder then the Orient stone
Like an apparition

Or as a pale shadow gone
Dumbe and deafe she hence is flowne

Then receive this equall dombe
Virgins , strow no teare or bloome

No one dig the Parian wombe
Raise her marble heart i'th ' roome

Oh , stay that covetous hand ; first turn all eye
All depth and minde ; then mystically spye

Her soul 's faire picture , her faire soul 's , in all
So truely copied from th ' originall

That you will sweare her body by this law
Is but its shadow , as this , its ; -- now draw

Cold as the breath of winds that blow
To silver shot descending snow

Yet cooled not the heat her sphere
Of beauties first had kindled there

Then mov 'd , and with a suddaine flame
Impatient to melt all againe

Yet warmed not the hearts , her nice
Disdaine had first congeal 'd to ice

And now her teares nor griev 'd desire
Can quench this raging , pleasing fire

Thus earth , from flames and ice repreeved
E 're since hath in her sun-shine lived

Finde such a woman says she loves
She 's that fixt heav'n , which never moves

Or your reflection in a glasse
Which keepes possession , though you passe

The stedfast lightning , slow loves dart
She kils , but ere we feele the smart

More faithfull then an Hebrew Jew
But as the divel not halfe so true

From the dire monument of thy black roome
Wher now that vestal flame thou dost intombe

Sacred Lucasta , like the pow'rfull ray
Of heavenly truth , passe this Cimmerian way

Arise and climbe our whitest , highest hill
There your sad thoughts with joy and wonder fill

Behold ! how lightning like a taper flyes
And guilds your chari't , but ashamed dyes

Threatning and boystrous tempests gently bow
And to your steps part in soft paths , when now

No showrs but 'twixt your lids , nor gelid snow
But what your whiter , chaster brest doth ow

Shrill trumpets doe only sound to eate
Artillery hath loaden ev'ry dish with meate

All things Lucasta , but Lucasta , call
Trees borrow tongues , waters in accents fall

Awake from the dead vault in which you dwell
All 's loyall here , except your thoughts rebell

See ! she obeys ! By all obeyed thus
No storms , heats , colds , no soules contentious

Lovers and angels , though in heav'n they show
And see the woes and discords here below

Up with the jolly bird of light
Who sounds his third retreat to night

Faire Amarantha from her bed
Ashamed starts , and rises red

As the carnation-mantled morne
Who now the blushing robe doth spurne

And puts on angry gray , whilst she
The envy of a deity

Arayes her limbes , too rich indeed
To be inshrin 'd in such a weed

Yet lovely 't was and strait , but fit
Not made for her , but she to it

By nature it sate close and free
As the just bark unto the tree

Unlike Love 's martyrs of the towne
All day imprison 'd in a gown

Who , rackt in silke 'stead of a dresse
Are cloathed in a frame or presse

And with that liberty and room
The dead expatiate in a tombe

No cabinets with curious washes
Bladders and perfumed plashes

No venome-temper 'd water 's here
Mercury is banished this sphere

Her payle 's all this , in which wet glasse
She both doth cleanse and view her face

Far hence , all Iberian smells
Hot amulets , Pomander spells

Fragrant gales , cool ay ' r , the fresh
And naturall odour of her flesh

Proclaim her sweet from th ' wombe as morne
Those colour 'd things were made , not borne

Which , fixt within their narrow straits
Do looke like their own counterfeyts

So like the Provance rose she walkt
Flowerd with blush , with verdure stalkt

Th ' officious wind her loose hayre curles
The dewe her happy linnen purles

But wets a tresse , which instantly
Sol with a crisping beame doth dry

Into the garden is she come
Love and delight 's Elisium

If ever earth show 'd all her store
View her discolourd budding floore

Here her glad eye she largely feedes
And stands 'mongst them , as they 'mong weeds

The flowers in their best aray
As to their queen their tribute pay

And freely to her lap proscribe
A daughter out of ev'ry tribe

Thus as she moves , they all bequeath
At once the incense of their breath

The noble Heliotropian
Now turnes to her , and knowes no sun

And as her glorious face doth vary
So opens loyall golden Mary

Who , if but glanced from her sight
Straight shuts again , as it were night

The violet ( else lost ith ' heap
Doth spread fresh purple for each step

With whose humility possest
Sh ' inthrones the Poore Girle in her breast

The July-flow ' r that hereto thrived
Knowing her self no longer-lived

But for one look of her upheaves
Then 'stead of teares straight sheds her leaves

Now the rich robed Tulip who
Clad all in tissue close , doth woe

Her ( sweet to th ' eye but smelling sower
She gathers to adorn her bower

But the proud Hony-suckle spreads
Like a pavilion her heads

Contemnes the wanting commonalty
That but to two ends usefull be

And to her lips thus aptly plac't
With smell and hue presents her tast

So all their due obedience pay
Each thronging to be in her way

Faire Amarantha with her eye
Thanks those that live , which else would dye

The rest , in silken fetters bound
By crowning her are crown and crowned

And now the sun doth higher rise
Our Flora to the meadow hies

The poore distressed heifers low
And as sh ' approacheth gently bow

Begging her charitable leasure
To strip them of their milkie treasure

Out of the yeomanry oth ' heard
With grave aspect , and feet prepared

A rev'rend lady-cow drawes neare
Bids Amarantha welcome here

And from her privy purse lets fall
A pearle or two , which seeme [ s ] to call

This adorn 'd adored fayry
To the banquet of her dayry

Soft Amarantha weeps to see
'Mongst men such inhumanitie

That those , who do receive in hay
And pay in silver twice a day

Should by their cruell barb'rous theft
Be both of that and life bereft

But 't is decreed , when ere this dies
That she shall fall a sacrifice

Unto the gods , since those , that trace
Her stemme , show 't is a god-like race

Descending in an even line
From heifers and from steeres divine

Making the honour 'd extract full
In Io and Europa 's bull

She was the largest goodliest beast
That ever mead or altar blest

Round [ w ] as her udder , and more white
Then is the Milkie Way in night

Her full broad eye did sparkle fire
Her breath was sweet as kind desire

And in her beauteous crescent shone
Bright as the argent-horned moone

But see ! this whiteness is obscure
Cynthia spotted , she impure

Her body writheld , and her eyes
Departing lights at obsequies

Her lowing hot to the fresh gale
Her breath perfumes the field withall

To those two suns that ever shine
To those plump parts she doth inshrine

To th ' hovering snow of either hand
That love and cruelty command

After the breakfast on her teat
She takes her leave oth ' mournfull neat

Who , by her toucht , now prizeth her life
Worthy alone the hollowed knife

Into the neighbring wood she 's gone
Whose roofe defies the tell-tale Sunne

And locks out ev'ry prying beame
Close by the lips of a cleare streame

She sits and entertaines her eye
With the moist chrystall and the frye

With burnisht-silver mal 'd , whose oares
Amazed still make to the shoares

What need she other bait or charm
What hook or angle , but her arm

The happy captive , gladly ta'n
Sues ever to be slave in vaine

Who instantly ( confirm 'd in 's feares
Hasts to his element of teares

From hence her various windings roave
To a well-orderd stately grove

This is the pallace of the wood
And court oth ' Royall Oake , where stood

The whole nobility : the Pine
Strait Ash , tall Firre , and wanton Vine

The proper Cedar , and the rest
Here she her deeper senses blest

Admires great Nature in this pile
Floor 'd with greene-velvet Camomile

Garnisht with gems of unset fruit
Supply 'd still with a self recruit

Her bosom wrought with pretty eyes
Of never-planted Strawberries

Where th ' winged musick of the ayre
Do richly feast , and for their fare

Each evening in a silent shade
Bestow a gratefull serenade

Thus ev'n tyerd with delight
Sated in soul and appetite

Full of the purple Plumme and Peare
The golden Apple , with the faire

Grape that mirth fain would have taught her
And nuts , which squirrells cracking brought her

She softly layes her weary limbs
Whilst gentle slumber now beginnes

To draw the curtaines of her eye
When straight awakend with a crie

And bitter groan , again reposes
Again a deep sigh interposes

And now she heares a trembling voyce
Ah ! can there ought on earth rejoyce

Why weares she this gay livery
Not black as her dark entrails be

Can trees be green , and to the ay ' r
Thus prostitute their flowing hayr

Why do they sprout , not witherd dy
Must each thing live , save wretched I

Can dayes triumph in blew and red
When both their light and life is fled

Fly Joy on wings of Popinjayes
To courts of fools , where as your playes

Dye laught at and forgot ; whilst all
That 's good mourns at this funerall

Weep , all ye Graces , and you sweet
Quire , that at the hill inspir 'd meet

Love , put thy tapers out , that we
And th ' world may seem as blind as thee

And be , since she is lost ( ah wound
Not Heav'n it self by any found

Now as a prisoner new cast
Who sleepes in chaines that night , his last

Next morn is wak't with a repreeve
And from his trance , not dream bid live

Wonders ( his sence not having scope
Who speaks , his friend or his false hope

So Amarantha heard , but feare
Dares not yet trust her tempting care

And as againe her arms oth ' ground
Spread pillows for her head , a sound

More dismall makes a swift divorce
And starts her thus : -- -- Rage , rapine , force

Ye blew-flam 'd daughters oth ' abysse
Bring all your snakes , here let them hisse

Let not a leaf its freshnesse keep
Blast all their roots , and as you creepe

And leave behind your deadly slime
Poyson the budding branch in 's prime

Wast the proud bowers of this grove
That fiends may dwell in it , and move

As in their proper hell , whilst she
Above laments this tragedy

Yet pities not our fate ; oh faire
Vow-breaker , now betroth 'd to th ' ay ' r

Why by those lawes did we not die
As live but one , Lucasta ! why

As he Lucasta nam 'd , a groan
Strangles the fainting passing tone

But as she heard , Lucasta smiles
Posses her round ; she 's slipt mean whiles

Behind the blind of a thick bush
When , each word temp'ring with a blush

She gently thus bespake ; Sad swaine
If mates in woe do ease our pain

Here 's one full of that antick grief
Which stifled would for ever live

But told , expires ; pray then , reveale
( To show our wound is half to heale

What mortall nymph or deity
Bewail you thus ? Who ere you be

The shepheard sigh't , my woes I crave
Smotherd in me , me in my grave

Yet be in show or truth a saint
Or fiend , breath anthemes , heare my plaint

For her and thy breath 's symphony
Which now makes full the harmony

Above , and to whose voice the spheres
Listen , and call her musick theirs

This was I blest on earth with , so
As Druids amorous did grow

Jealous of both : for as one day
This star , as yet but set in clay

They steept her in the hollowed brooke
Which from her humane nature tooke

And straight to heaven with winged feare
Thus , ravisht with her , ravish her

The nymph reply 'd : This holy rape
Became the gods , whose obscure shape

They cloth 'd with light , whilst ill you grieve
Your better life should ever live

And weep that she , to whom you wish
What heav'n could give , has all its blisse

Calling her angell here , yet be
Sad at this true divinity

She 's for the altar , not the skies
Whom first you crowne , then sacrifice

Fond man thus to a precipice
Aspires , till at the top his eyes

Have lost the safety of the plain
Then begs of Fate the vales againe

The now confounded shepheard cries
Ye all-confounding destines

How did you make that voice so sweet
Without that glorious form to it

Thou sacred spirit of my deare
Where e 're thou hoverst o 're us , hear

Imbark thee in the lawrell tree
And a new Phebus follows thee

Who , 'stead of all his burning rayes
Will strive to catch thee with his layes

Or , if within the Orient Vine
Thou art both deity and wine

But if thou takest the mirtle grove
That Paphos is , thou , Queene of Love

And I , thy swain who ( else ) must die
By no beasts , but thy cruelty

But you are rougher than the winde
Are souls on earth then heav'n more kind

Imprisoned in mortality
Lucasta would have answered me

Lucasta , Amarantha said
Is she that virgin-star ? a maid

Except her prouder livery
In beauty poore , and cheap as I

Whose glory like a meteor shone
Or aery apparition

Admir 'd a while , but slighted known
Fierce , as the chafed lyon hies

He rowses him , and to her flies
Thinking to answer with his speare

Now , as in warre intestine where
Ith ' mist of a black battell , each

Layes at his next , then makes a breach
Through th ' entrayles of another , whom

He sees nor knows whence he did come
Guided alone by rage and th ' drumme

But stripping and impatient wild
He finds too soon his onely child

So our expiring desp'rate lover
Far 'd when , amaz 'd , he did discover

Lucasta in this nymph ; his sinne
Darts the accursed javelin

'Gainst his own breast , which she puts by
With a soft lip and gentle eye

Then closes with him on the ground
And now her smiles have heal 'd his wound

But not untill those heavy crimes
She hath kis 'd off a thousand times

Who not contented with this pain
Doth threaten to offend again

And now they gaze , and sigh , and weep
Whilst each cheek doth the other 's steep

Whilst tongues , as exorcis 'd , are calm
Onely the rhet'rick of the palm

Prevailing pleads , untill at last
They [ re ] chain 'd in one another fast

Lucasta to him doth relate
Her various chance and diffring fate

How chac 'd by Hydraphil , and tract
The num'rous foe to Philanact

Who whilst they for the same things fight
As Bards decrees and Druids rite

For safeguard of their proper joyes
And shepheards freedome , each destroyes

The glory of this Sicilie
Since seeking thus the remedie

They fancy ( building on false ground
The means must them and it confound

Yet are resolved to stand or fall
And win a little , or lose all

From this sad storm of fire and blood
She fled to this yet living wood

Where she 'mongst savage beasts doth find
Her self more safe then humane kind

Then she relates , how Caelia
The lady -- here strippes her array

And girdles her in home-spunne bayes
Then makes her conversant in layes

Of birds , and swaines more innocent
That kenne not guile [ n ] or courtship ment

Now walks she to her bow ' r to dine
Under a shade of Eglantine

Upon a dish of Natures cheere
Which both grew , drest and serv 'd up there

That done , she feasts her smell with po'ses
Pluckt from the damask cloath of Roses

Which there continually doth stay
And onely frost can take away

Then wagers which hath most content
Her eye , eare , hand , her gust or sent

Intranc't Alexis sees and heares
As walking above all the spheres

Knows and adores this , and is wilde
Untill with her he live thus milde

So that , which to his thoughts he meant
For losse of her a punishment

His armes hung up and his sword broke
His ensignes folded , he betook

Himself unto the humble crook
And for a full reward of all

She now doth him her shepheard call
And in a see of flow'rs install

Then gives her faith immediately
Which he returns religiously

Both vowing in her peacefull cave
To make their bridall-bed and grave

But the true joy this pair conceived
Each from the other first bereaved

And then found , after such alarmes
Fast-pinion 'd in each other 's armes

Ye panting virgins , that do meet
Your loves within their winding sheet

Breathing and constant still ev'n there
Or souls their bodies in yon ' sphere

Or angels , men return 'd from hell
And separated mindes -- can tell

If in me anger , or disdaine
In you , or both , made me refraine

From th ' noble intercourse of verse
That only vertuous thoughts rehearse

Then , chaste Ellinda , might you feare
The sacred vowes that I did sweare

But if alone some pious thought
Me to an inward sadnesse brought

Thinking to breath your soule too welle
My tongue was charmed with that spell

And left it ( since there was no roome
To voyce your worth enough ) strooke dumbe

So then this silence doth reveal
No thought of negligence , but zeal

For , as in adoration
This is love 's true devotion

Children and fools the words repeat
But anch'rites pray in tears and sweat

But she a-gathering flowr 's and hearts is gone
And thou left voyd to rude possession

The slender turnings of thy narrow roome
But must ejected be by his owne dombe

Yet servants , knowing minikin nor base
Are still allow 'd to fiddle with the case

For cherries plenty , and for corans
Enough for fifty , were there more on 's

For elles of beere , flutes of canary
That well did wash downe pasties-Mary

For peason , chickens , sawces high
Pig , and the widdow-venson-pye

With certaine promise ( to your brother
Of the virginity of another

Where it is thought I too may peepe in
With knuckles far as any deepe in

For glasses , heads , hands , bellies full
Of wine , and loyne right-worshipfull

Whether all of , or more behind -- a
Thankes freest , freshest , faire Ellinda

Thankes for my visit not disdaining
Or at the least thankes for your feigning

For if your mercy doore were lockt-well
I should be justly soundly knockt-well

Cause that in dogrell I did mutter
Not one rhime to you from dam-Rotter

Next beg I to present my duty
To pregnant sister in prime beauty

Whom well I deeme ( e 're few months elder
Will take out Hans from pretty Kelder

And to the sweetly fayre Mabella
A match that vies with Arabella

In each respect but the misfortune
Fortune , Fate , I thee importune

Nor must I passe the lovely Alice
Whose health I 'd quaffe in golden chalice

But since that Fate hath made me neuter
I only can in beaker pewter

But who 'd forget , or yet left un-sung
The doughty acts of George the yong-son

Who yesterday to save his sister
Had slaine the snake , had he not mist her

But I shall leave him , 'till a nag on
He gets to prosecute the dragon

And then with helpe of sun and taper
Fill with his deeds twelve reames of paper

That Amadis , Sir Guy , and Topaz
With his fleet neigher shall keep no-pace

It was Amyntor 's Grove , that Chloris
For ever ecchoes , and her glories

Chloris , the gentlest sheapherdesse
That ever lawnes and lambes did blesse

Her breath , like to the whispering winde
Was calme as thought , sweet as her minde

Her lips like coral gates kept in
The perfume and the pearle within

Her eyes a double-flaming torch
That alwayes shine , and never scorch

Her selfe the Heav'n in which did meet
The all of bright , of faire and sweet

Here was I brought with that delight
That seperated soules take flight

And when my reason call 'd my sence
Back somewhat from this excellence

That I could see , I did begin
T ' observe the curious ordering

Of every roome , where 'ts hard to know
Which most excels in sent or show

Arabian gummes do breathe here forth
And th ' East 's come over to the North

The windes have brought their hyre of sweet
To see Amyntor Chloris greet

Balme and nard , and each perfume
To blesse this payre , chafe and consume

And th ' Phoenix , see ! already fries
Her neast a fire in Chloris eyes

Next the great and powerful hand
Beckens my thoughts unto a stand

Of Titian , Raphael , Georgone
Whose art even Nature hath out-done

For if weake Nature only can
Intend , not perfect , what is man

These certainely we must prefer
Who mended what she wrought , and her

And sure the shadowes of those rare
And kind incomparable fayre

Are livelier , nobler company
Then if they could or speake , or see

For these I aske without a tush
Can kisse or touch without a blush

And we are taught that substance is
If uninjoy 'd , but th ' shade of blisse

Now every saint cleerly divine
Is clos 'd so in her severall shrine

The gems so rarely , richly set
For them wee love the cabinet

So intricately plac't withall
As if th ' imbrordered the wall

So that the pictures seem 'd to be
But one continued tapistrie

After this travell of mine eyes
We sate , and pitied Dieties

Wee bound our loose hayre with the vine
The poppy , and the eglantine

One swell 'd an oriental bowle
Full , as a grateful , loyal soule

To Chloris ! Chloris ! Heare , oh , heare
'T is pledg 'd above in ev'ry sphere

Now streight the Indians richest prize
Is kindled in glad sacrifice

Cloudes are sent up on wings of thyme
Amber , pomgranates , jessemine

And through our earthen conduicts sore
Higher then altars fum 'd before

So drencht we our oppressing cares
And choakt the wide jawes of our feares

Whilst ravisht thus we did devise
If this were not a Paradice

In all , except these harmlesse sins
Behold ! flew in two cherubins

Cleare as the skye from whence they came
And brighter than the sacred flame

The boy adorn 'd with modesty
Yet armed so with majesty

That if the Thunderer againe
His eagle sends , she stoops in vaine

Besides his innocence he tooke
A sword and casket , and did looke

Like Love in armes ; he wrote but five
Yet spake eighteene ; each grace did strive

And twenty Cupids thronged forth
Who first should shew his prettier worth

But oh , the Nymph ! Did you ere know
Carnation mingled with snow

Or have you seene the lightning shrowd
And straight breake through th ' opposing cloud

So ran her blood ; such was its hue
So through her vayle her bright haire flew

And yet its glory did appeare
But thinne , because her eyes were neere

Blooming boy , and blossoming mayd
May your faire sprigges be neere betrayed

To eating worme or fouler storme
No serpent lurke to do them harme

No sharpe frost cut , no North-winde teare
The verdure of that fragrant hayre

But may the sun and gentle weather
When you are both growne ripe together

Load you with fruit , such as your Father
From you with all the joyes doth gather

And may you , when one branch is dead
Graft such another in its stead

Lasting thus ever in your prime
'Till th ' sithe is snatcht away from Time

And 't was last night I swore to thee
That fond impossibility

And rob thee of a new imbrace
Should I still dote upon thy face

Like skilfulle minerallists that sound
For treasure in un-plow'd-up ground

I laden will returne to thee
Ev'n sated with varietie

I saw a little Diety
MINERVA in epitomy

Whom VENUS , at first blush , surprised
Tooke for her winged wagge disguised

But viewing then , whereas she made
Not a distrest , but lively shade

Now wanton , and ith ' coole oth ' Sunne
With her delight a hunting gone

And thousands more , whom he had slaine
To live and love , belov 'd againe

Ah ! this is true divinity
I will un-God that toye ! cri 'd she

Then markt she SYRINX running fast
To Pan 's imbraces , with the haste

Shee fled him once , whose reede-pipe rent
He finds now a new Instrument

THESEUS return 'd invokes the Ayre
And windes , then wafts his faire

Whilst ARIADNE ravish't stood
Half in his armes , halfe in the flood

Proud ANAXERETE doth fall
At IPHIS feete , who smiles at all

And he ( whilst she his curles doth deck
Hangs no where now , but on her neck

Here PHOEBUS with a beame untombes
Long-hid LEUCOTHOE , and doomes

Her father there ; DAPHNE the faire
Knowes now no bayes but round her haire

And to APOLLO and his Sons
Who pay him their due Orisons

Bequeaths her lawrell-robe , that flame
Contemnes , Thunder and evill Fame

There kneel 'd ADONIS fresh as spring
Gay as his youth , now offering

Herself those joyes with voice and hand
Which first he could not understand

Transfixed VENUS stood amased
Full of the Boy and Love , she gazed

And in imbraces seemed more
Senceless and colde then he before

Uselesse Childe ! In vaine ( said she
You beare that fond artillerie

See heere a pow ' r above the slow
Weake execution of thy bow

So said , she riv 'd the wood in two
Unedged all his arrowes too

And with the string their feathers bound
To that part , whence we have our wound

See , see ! the darts by which we burned
Are bright Loysa 's pencills turned

With which she now enliveth more
Beauties , than they destroy 'd before

Were it that you so shun me , 'cause you wish
( Cruels't ) a fellow in your wretchednesse

Or that you take some small ease in your owne
Torments , to heare another sadly groane

I were most happy in my paines , to be
So truely blest , to be so curst by thee

But oh ! my cries to that doe rather adde
Of which too much already thou hast had

And thou art gladly sad to heare my moane
Yet sadly hearst me with derision

Thou most unjust , that really dust know
And feelst thyselfe the flames I burne in . Oh

How can you beg to be set loose from that
Consuming stake you binde another at

Uncharitablest both wayes , to denie
That pity me , for which yourself must dye

To love not her loves you , yet know the pain
What 't is to love , and not be lov 'd againe

Flye on , flye on , swift Racer , untill she
Whom thou of all ador'st shall learne of thee

The pace t'outfly thee , and shall teach thee groan
What terrour 't is t'outgo and be outgon

Nor yet looke back , nor yet must we
Run then like spoakes in wheeles eternally

And never overtake ? Be dragg 'd on still
By the weake cordage of your untwin 'd will

Round without hope of rest ? No , I will turne
And with my goodnes boldly meete your scorne

My goodnesse which Heav'n pardon , and that fate
MADE YOU HATE LOVE , AND FALL IN LOVE WITH HATE

But I am chang 'd ! Bright reason , that did give
My soule a noble quicknes , made me live

One breath yet longer , and to will , and see
Hath reacht me pow ' r to scorne as well as thee

That thou , which proudly tramplest on my grave
Thyselfe mightst fall , conquer 'd my double slave

That thou mightst , sinking in thy triumphs , moan
And I triumph in my destruction

Hayle , holy cold ! chaste temper , hayle ! the fire
Rav 'd o 're my purer thoughts I feel t ' expire

And I am candied ice . Yee pow'rs ! if e 're
I shall be forc't unto my sepulcher

Or violently hurl 'd into my urne
Oh make me choose rather to freeze than burne

Hither with hallowed steps as is the ground
That must enshrine this saint with lookes profound

And sad aspects as the dark vails you weare
Virgins opprest , draw gently , gently neare

Enter the dismall chancell of this rooome
Where each pale guest stands fixt a living tombe

With trembling hands helpe to remove this earth
To its last death and first victorious birth

Let gums and incense fume , who are at strife
To enter th ' hearse and breath in it new life

Mingle your steppes with flowers as you goe
Which , as they haste to fade , will speake your woe

And when y ' have plac't your tapers on her urn
How poor a tribute 't is to weep and mourn

That flood the channell of your eye-lids fils
When you lose trifles , or what 's lesse , your wills

If you ' l be worthy of these obsequies
Be blind unto the world , and drop your eyes

Waste and consume , burn downward as this fire
That 's fed no more : so willingly expire

Passe through the cold and obscure narrow way
Then light your torches at the spring of day

There with her triumph in your victory
Such joy alone and such solemnity

Or , if you faint to be so blest , oh heare
If not to dye , dare but to live like her

Dare to live virgins , till the honour 'd age
Of thrice fifteen cals matrons on the stage

Whilst not a blemish or least staine is scene
On your white roabe 'twixt fifty and fifteene

But as it in your swathing-bands was given
Bring't in your winding sheet unsoyl 'd to Heav'n

Daere to do purely , without compact good
Or herald , by no one understood

But him , who now in thanks bows either knee
For th ' early benefit and secresie

Dare to affect a serious holy sorrow
To which delights of pallaces are narrow

And , lasting as their smiles , dig you a roome
Where practise the probation of your tombe

With ever-bended knees and piercing pray ' r
Smooth the rough passe through craggy earth to ay ' r

May put in safely , and secure their feares
Who , adding to your joyes , now owe you theirs

Virgins , if thus you dare but courage take
To follow her in life , else through this lake

Of Nature wade , and breake her earthly bars
Y ' are fixt with her upon a throne of stars

Arched with a pure Heav'n chrystaline
Where round you love and joy for ever shine

But you are dumbe , as what you do lament
More senseles then her very monument

Which at your weaknes weeps . Spare that vaine teare
Enough to burst the rev'rend sepulcher

Rise and walk home ; there groaning prostrate fall
And celebrate your owne sad funerall

For howsoe 're you move , may heare , or see
YOU ARE MORE DEAD AND BURIED THEN SHEE

You that shall live awhile , before
Old time tyrs , and is no more

When that this ambitious stone
Stoopes low as what it tramples on

Know that in that age , when sinne
Gave the world law , and governd Queene

A virgin liv 'd , that still put on
White thoughts , though out of fashion

That trac't the stars , 'spite of report
And durst be good , though chidden for't

Of such a soule that infant Heav'n
Repented what it thus had giv'n

For finding equall happy man
Th ' impatient pow'rs snatch it agen

Thus , chaste as th ' ayre whither shee 's fled
She , making her celestiall bed

In her warme alablaster , lay
As cold is in this house of clay

Nor were the rooms unfit to feast
Or circumscribe this angel-guest

The radiant gemme was brightly set
In as divine a carkanet

Of which the clearer was not knowne
Her minde or her complexion

Such an everlasting grace
Such a beatifick face

Incloysters here this narrow floore
That possest all hearts before

Blest and bewayl 'd in death and birth
The smiles and teares of heav'n and earth

Virgins at each step are afeard
Filmer is shot by which they steered

Their star extinct , their beauty dead
That the yong world to honour led

But see ! the rapid spheres stand still
And tune themselves unto her will

Thus , although this marble must
As all things , crumble into dust

And though you finde this faire-built tombe
Ashes , as what lyes in its wombe

Yet her saint-like name shall shine
A living glory to this shrine

And her eternall fame be read
When all but VERY VERTUE 'S DEAD

See ! what a clouded majesty , and eyes
Whose glory through their mist doth brighter rise

See ! what an humble bravery doth shine
And griefe triumphant breaking through each line

How it commands the face ! so sweet a scorne
Never did HAPPY MISERY adorne

So sacred a contempt , that others show
To this , ( oth ' height of all the wheele ) below

That mightiest monarchs by this shaded booke
May coppy out their proudest , richest looke

Whilst the true eaglet this quick luster spies
And by his SUN 'S enlightens his owne eyes

He cures his cares , his burthen feeles , then streight
Joyes that so lightly he can beare such weight

Whilst either eithers passion doth borrow
And both doe grieve the same victorious sorrow

These , my best LILLY , with so bold a spirit
And soft a grace , as if thou didst inherit

For that time all their greatnesse , and didst draw
With those brave eyes your royal sitters saw

Not as of old , when a rough hand did speake
A strong aspect , and a faire face , a weake

When only a black beard cried villaine , and
By hieroglyphicks we could understand

When chrystall typified in a white spot
And the bright ruby was but one red blot

Thou dost the things Orientally the same
Not only paintst its colour , but its flame

Thou sorrow canst designe without a teare
And with the man his very hope or feare

So that th ' amazed world shall henceforth finde
None but my LILLY ever drew a MINDE

With that delight the Royal captiv 's brought
Before the throne , to breath his farewell thought

To tel his last tale , and so end with it
Which gladly he esteemes a benefit

When the brave victor , at his great soule dumbe
Findes something there fate can not overcome

Cals the chain 'd prince , and by his glory led
First reaches him his crowne , and then his head

Who ne 're 'til now thinks himself slave and poor
For though nought else , he had himselfe before

He weepes at this faire chance , nor wil allow
But that the diadem doth brand his brow

And under-rates himselfe below mankinde
Who first had lost his body , now his minde

With such a joy came I to heare my dombe
And haste the preparation of my tombe

When , like good angels who have heav'nly charge
To steere and guide mans sudden giddy barge

She snatcht me from the rock I was upon
And landed me at life 's pavillion

Where I , thus wound out of th ' immense abysse
Was straight set on a pinacle of blisse

Let me leape in againe ! and by that fall
Bring me to my first woe , so cancel all

Ah ! 's this a quitting of the debt you owe
To crush her and her goodnesse at one blowe

Defend me from so foule impiety
Would make friends grieve , and furies weep to see

Now , ye sage spirits , which infuse in men
That are oblidg 'd twice to oblige agen

Informe my tongue in labour what to say
And in what coyne or language to repay

But you are silent as the ev'nings ayre
When windes unto their hollow grots repaire

Oh , then accept the all that left me is
Devout oblations of a sacred wish

When she walks forth , ye perfum 'd wings oth ' East
Fan her , 'til with the Sun she hastes to th ' West

And when her heav'nly course calles up the day
And breakes as bright , descend , some glistering ray

To circle her , and her as glistering haire
That all may say a living saint shines there

Slow Time , with woollen feet make thy soft pace
And leave no tracks ith ' snow of her pure face

But when this vertue must needs fall , to rise
The brightest constellation in the skies

When we in characters of fire shall reade
How cleere she was alive , how spotless , dead

All you that are a kinne to piety
For onely you can her close mourners be

Draw neer , and make of hallowed teares a dearth
Goodnes and justice both are fled the earth

If this be to be thankful , I ' v a heart
Broaken with vowes , eaten with grateful smart

And beside this , the vild world nothing hath
Worth anything but her provoked wrath

So then , who thinkes to satisfie in time
Must give a satisfaction for that crime

Since she alone knowes the gifts value , she
Can onely to her selfe requitall be

And worthyly to th ' life paynt her owne story
In its true colours and full native glory

Which when perhaps she shal be heard to tell
Buffoones and theeves , ceasing to do ill

Shal blush into a virgin-innocence
And then woo others from the same offence

The robber and the murderer , in 'spite
Of his red spots , shal startle into white

All good ( rewards layd by ) shal stil increase
For love of her , and villany decease

Naught be ignote , not so much out of feare
Of being punisht , as offending her

So that , when as my future daring bayes
Shall bow it selfe in lawrels to her praise

To crown her conqu'ring goodnes , and proclaime
The due renowne and glories of her name

My wit shal be so wretched and so poore
That , 'stead of praysing , I shal scandal her

And leave , when with my purest art I ' v done
Scarce the designe of what she is begunne

Yet men shal send me home , admir 'd , exact
Proud , that I could from her so wel detract

Where , then , thou bold instinct , shal I begin
My endlesse taske ? To thanke her were a sin

Great as not speake , and not to speake , a blame
Beyond what 's worst , such as doth want a name

So thou my all , poore gratitude , ev'n thou
In this wilt an unthankful office do

Or wilt I fling all at her feet I have
My life , my love , my very soule , a slave

Tye my free spirit onely unto her
And yeeld up my affection prisoner

Fond thought , in this thou teachest me to give
What first was hers , since by her breath I live

And hast but show 'd me , how I may resigne
Possession of those thing are none of mine

A gentleman , to give us somewhat new
Hath brought up OXFORD with him to show you

Pray be not frighted -- Tho the scaene and gown 's
The Universities , the wit 's the town 's

The lines each honest Englishman may speake
Yet not mistake his mother-tongue for Greeke

For stil 't was part of his vow 'd liturgie
From learned comedies deliver me

Wishing all those that lov 'd 'em here asleepe
Promising SCHOLARS , but no SCHOLARSHIP

You 'd smile to see , how he do 's vex and shake
Speakes naught ; but , if the PROLOGUE do 's but take

Or the first act were past the pikes once , then
Then hopes and joys , then frowns and fears agen

Then blushes like a virgin , now to be
Rob 'd of his comicall virginity

In presence of you all . In short , you 'd say
More hopes of mirth are in his looks then play

These feares are for the noble and the wise
But if 'mongst you there are such fowle dead eyes

As can damne unaraign 'd , cal law their pow'rs
Judging it sin enough that it is ours

And with the house shift their decreed desires
FAIRE still to th ' BLACKE , BLACKE still to the WHITE-FRYERS

So far from quarr'lling with himselfe and wit
That he wil thank them for the benefit

Since finding nothing worthy of their hate
They reach him that themselves must envy at

The stubborne author of the trifle crime
That just now cheated you of two hours ' time

Presumptuous it lik't him , began to grow
Carelesse , whether it pleased you or no

But we who ground th ' excellence of a play
On what the women at the dores wil say

Who judge it by the benches , and afford
To take your money , ere his oath or word

His SCHOLLARS school 'd , sayd if he had been wise
He should have wove in one two COMEDIES

The first for th ' gallery , in which the throne
To their amazement should descend alone

The rosin-lightning flash , and monster spire
Squibs , and words hotter then his fire

Th ' other for the gentlemen oth ' pit
Like to themselves , all spirit , fancy , wit

In which plots should be subtile as a flame
Disguises would make PROTEUS stil the same

Humours so rarely humour 'd and exprest
That ev'n they should thinke 'em so , not drest

Vices acted and applauded too , times
Tickled , and th ' actors acted , not their crimes

So he might equally applause have gained
Of th ' hardned , sooty , and the snowy hand

Where now one SO SO spatters , t'other : no
Tis his first play ; twere solecisme 'tshould goe

The next 't show 'd pritily , but searcht within
It appeares bare and bald , as is his chin

The towne-wit sentences : A SCHOLARS PLAY
Pish ! I know not why , but th'ave not the way

We , whose gaine is all our pleasure , ev'n these
Are bound by justice and religion to please

Which he , whose pleasure 's all his gaine , goes by
As slightly , as they doe his comaedy

Culls out the few , the worthy , at whose feet
He sacrifices both himselfe and it

His fancies first fruits : profit he knowes none
Unles that of your approbation

Which if your thoughts at going out will pay
Hee ' l not looke farther for a second day

Vnhappy youth , betrayd by Fate
To such a love hath sainted hate

And damned those celestiall bands
Are onely knit with equal hands

The love of great ones is a love
Gods are incapable to prove

For where there is a joy uneven
There never , never can be Heav'n

'T is such a love as is not sent
To fiends as yet for punishment

IXION willingly doth feele
The gyre of his eternal wheele

Nor would he now exchange his paine
For cloudes and goddesses againe

Wouldst thou with tempests lye ? Then bow
To th ' rougher furrows of her brow

Or make a thunder-bolt thy choyce
Then catch at her more fatal voyce

Or 'gender with the lightning ? trye
The subtler flashes of her eye

Poore SEMELE wel knew the same
Who both imbrac't her God and flame

And not alone in soule did burne
But in this love did ashes turne

How il doth majesty injoy
The bow and gaity oth ' boy

As if the purple-roabe should sit
And sentence give ith ' chayr of wit

Say , ever-dying wretch , to whom
Each answer is a certaine doom

What is it that you would possesse
The Countes , or the naked Besse

Would you her gowne or title do
Her box or gem , the thing or show

If you meane HER , the very HER
Abstracted from her caracter

Unhappy boy ! you may as soone
With fawning wanton with the Moone

Or with an amorous complaint
Get prostitute your very saint

Not that we are not mortal , or
Fly VENUS altars , and abhor

The selfesame knack , for which you pine
But we ( defend us ! ) are divine

[ Not ] female , but madam born , and come
From a right-honourable wombe

Shal we then mingle with the base
And bring a silver-tinsell race

Whilst th ' issue noble wil not passe
The gold alloyd ( almost halfe brasse

And th ' blood in each veine doth appeare
Part thick Booreinn , part Lady Cleare

Like to the sordid insects sprung
From Father Sun and Mother Dung

Yet lose we not the hold we have
But faster graspe the trembling slave

Play at baloon with 's heart , and winde
The strings like scaines , steale into his minde

Ten thousand false and feigned joyes
Far worse then they ; whilst , like whipt boys

This heard , Sir , play stil in her eyes
And be a dying , live like flyes

Caught by their angle-legs , and whom
The torch laughs peece-meale to consume

Now the peace is made at the foes rate
Whilst men of armes to kettles their old helmes translate

In ev'ry hand [ let ] a cup be found
That from all hearts a health may sound

He whose glories shine so brave and high
That captive they in triumph leade each care and eye

And from the earth to heav'n rebound
Fixt there eternall as this round

To his lovely bride , in love with scars
Whose eyes wound deepe in peace , as doth his sword in wars

Her cheekes the morning blushes give
And the benighted world repreeve

Give me scorching heat , thy heat , dry Sun
That to this payre I may drinke off an ocean

Or a full bowle of heav'nly wine
In which dissolved stars should shine

Heark , faire one , how what e 're here is
Doth laugh and sing at thy distresse

Not out of hate to thy reliefe
But joy t ' enjoy thee , though in griefe

See ! that which chaynes you , you chaine here
The prison is thy prisoner

How much thy jaylor 's keeper art
He bindes your hands , but you his heart

The gyves to rase so smooth a skin
Are so unto themselves within

But , blest to kisse so fayre an arme
Haste to be happy with that harme

And play about thy wanton wrist
As if in them thou so wert drest

But if too rough , too hard they presse
Oh , they but closely , closely kisse

And as thy bare feet blesse the way
The people doe not mock , but pray

And call thee , as amas 'd they run
Instead of prostitute , a nun

The merry torch burnes with desire
To kindle the eternall fire

And lightly daunces in thine eyes
To tunes of epithalamies

The sheet 's ty 'd ever to thy wast
How thankfull to be so imbrac't

And see ! thy very very bonds
Are bound to thee , to binde such hands

If teares could wash the ill away
A pearle for each wet bead I 'd pay

But as dew 'd corne the fuller growes
So water 'd eyes but swell our woes

One drop another cals , which still
( Griefe adding fuell ) doth distill

Too fruitfull of her selfe is anguish
We need no cherishing to languish

Coward fate degen'rate man
Like little children uses , when

He whips us first , untill we weepe
Then , 'cause we still a weeping keepe

Then from thy firme selfe never swerve
Teares fat the griefe that they should sterve

Iron decrees of destinie
Are ner ' e wipe't out with a wet eye

But this way you may gaine the field
Oppose but sorrow , and 'twill yield

One gallant thorough-made resolve
Doth starry influence dissolve

This is the prittiest motion
Madam , th ' alarums of a drumme

That cals your lord , set to your cries
To mine are sacred symphonies

What , though 't is said I have a voice
I know 't is but that hollow noise

Which ( as it through my pipe doth speed
Bitterns do carol through a reed

In the same key with monkeys jiggs
Or dirges of proscribed piggs

Or the soft Serenades above
In calme of night , when cats make love

Was ever such a consort seen
Fourscore and fourteen with forteen

Yet sooner they ' l agree , one paire
Then we in our spring-winter aire

They may imbrace , sigh , kiss , the rest
Our breath knows nought but east and west

Thus have I heard to childrens cries
The faire nurse still such lullabies

That , well all sayd ( for what there lay
The pleasure did the sorrow pay

Sure ther 's another way to save
Your phansie , madam ; that 's to have

( 'T is but a petitioning kinde fate
The organs sent to Bilingsgate

Where they to that soft murm'ring quire
Shall teach you all you can admire

Or do but heare , how love-bang Kate
In pantry darke for freage of mate

With edge of steele the square wood shapes
And DIDO to it chaunts or scrapes

The merry Phaeton oth ' carre
You ' l vow makes a melodious jarre

Sweeter and sweeter whisleth He
To un-anointed axel-tree

Such swift notes he and 's wheels do run
For me , I yeeld him Phaebus son

Say , faire Comandres , can it be
You should ordaine a mutinie

For where I howle , all accents fall
As kings harangues , to one and all

Ulisses art is now withstood
You ravish both with sweet and good

Saint Syren , sing , for I dare heare
But when I ope ' , oh , stop your eare

Far lesse be't aemulation
To passe me , or in trill or tone

Like the thin throat of Philomel
And the smart lute who should excell

As if her soft cords should begin
And strive for sweetnes with the pin

Yet can I musick too ; but such
As is beyond all voice or touch

My minde can in faire order chime
Whilst my true heart still beats the time

My soule [ 's ] so full of harmonie
That it with all parts can agree

If you winde up to the highest fret
It shall descend an eight from it

And when you shall vouchsafe to fall
Sixteene above you it shall call

And yet , so dis-assenting one
They both shall meet in unison

Come then , bright cherubin , begin
My loudest musick is within

Take all notes with your skillfull eyes
Hearke , if mine do not sympathise

Sound all my thoughts , and see exprest
The tablature of my large brest

Then you ' l admit , that I too can
Musick above dead sounds of man

Such as alone doth blesse the spheres
Not to be reacht with humane eares

`` Come , pretty birds , present your lays
And learn to chaunt a goddess praise

Ye wood-nymphs , let your voices be
Employ 'd to serve her deity

And warble forth , ye virgins nine
Some music to my Valentine

`` Her bosom is love 's paradise
There is no heav'n but in her eyes

She 's chaster than the turtle-dove
And fairer than the queen of love

Yet all perfections do combine
To beautifie my Valentine

`` She 's Nature 's choicest cabinet
Where honour , beauty , worth and wit

Are all united in her breast
The graces claim an interest

All virtues that are most divine
Shine clearest in my Valentine

Tell me , ye subtill judges in loves treasury
Inform me , which hath most inricht mine eye

Ye cloudy spark lights , whose vast multitude
Of fires are harder to be found then viewed

Calmely or roughly ! Ah , she shines too much
That now I lye ( her influence is such

Lovers , beware ! a certaine , double harme
Waits your proud hopes , her looks al-killing charm

Thus with her eyes brave Tamyris spake dread
Which when the kings dull breast not entered

I can not tell , who loves the skeleton
Of a poor marmoset ; nought but boan , boan

Such , whose white-sattin upper coat of skin
Cut upon velvet rich incarnadin

Sure , it is meant good husbandry in men
Who do incorporate with aery leane

Hard hap unto that huntsman , that decrees
Fat joys for all his swet , when as he sees

Then , Love , I beg , when next thou tak'st thy bow
Thy angry shafts , and dost heart-chasing go

I will suffice thy hungry need
So thou wilt but my fancy feed

Like gold in canvas , or with dirt
Unsoyled Ermins close begirt

At th ' barrell 's head there shines the vine
There only relishes the wine

So both our wants supplied shall be
You ' l give for love , I , charity

Wee ' l ransack neither chest nor shelfe
Ill cover thee with mine owne selfe

Since all must judge you more unkinde
I starve your body , you , my minde

You , that can haply mixe your joyes with cries
And weave white Ios with black Elegies

Can caroll out a dirge , and in one breath
Sing to the tune either of life , or death

You , that can weepe the gladnesse of the spheres
And pen a hymne , in stead of inke , with teares

Here , here your unproportion 'd wit let fall
To celebrate this new-borne funerall

And greete that little greatnesse , which from th ' wombe
Dropt both a load to th ' cradle and the tombe

Bright soule ! teach us , to warble with what feet
Thy swathing linnen and thy winding sheet

Weepe , or shout forth that fonts solemnitie
Which at once christn 'd and buried thee

And change our shriller passions with that sound
First told thee into th ' ayre , then to the ground

Ah , wert thou borne for this ? only to call
The King and Queen guests to your buriall

To bid good night , your day not yet begun
And shew a setting , ere a rising sun

Or wouldst thou have thy life a martyrdom
Dye in the act of thy religion

Fit , excellently , innocently good
First sealing it with water , then thy blood

As when on blazing wings a blest man sores
And having past to God through fiery dores

Straight 's roab 'd with flames , when the same element
Which was his shame , proves now his ornament

Oh , how he hast'ned death , bur n't to be fryed
Kill 'd twice with each delay , till deified

So swift hath been thy race , so full of flight
Like him condemn 'd , ev'n aged with a night

Cutting all lets with clouds , as if th ' hadst been
Like angels plum 'd , and borne a Cherubin

Or , in your journey towards heav'n , say
Tooke you the world a little in your way

Saw'st and dislik'st its vaine pompe , then didst flye
Up for eternall glories to the skye

Like a religious ambitious one
Aspiredst for the everlasting crowne

Ah ! holy traytour to your brother prince
Rob 'd of his birth-right and preheminence

Could you ascend yon ' chaire of state e 're him
And snatch from th ' heire the starry diadem

Making your honours now as much uneven
As gods on earth are lesse then saints in heav'n

Triumph ! sing triumphs , then ! Oh , put on all
Your richest lookes , drest for this festivall

Thoughts full of ravisht reverence , with eyes
So fixt , as when a saint we canonize

Clap wings with Seraphins before the throne
At this eternall coronation

And teach your soules new mirth , such as may be
Worthy this birth-day to divinity

But ah ! these blast your feasts , the jubilies
We send you up are sad , as were our cries

And of true joy we can expresse no more
Thus crown 'd , then when we buried thee before

Princesse in heav'n , forgivenes ! whilst we
Resigne our office to the HIERARCHY

`` The happy OBJECT of her eye
Was SIDNEY 'S living ARCADY

Whose amorous tale had so betraied
Desire in this all-lovely maid

That , whilst her check a blush did warm
I read LOVES story in her form

How have I bin religious ? what strange good
Has scap't me , that I never understood

Have I hel-guarded Haeresie o'rthrowne
Heald wounded states ? made kings and kingdoms one

That FATE should be so merciful to me
To let me live t ' have said I have read thee

Faire star , ascend ! the joy ! the life ! the light
Of this tempestuous age , this darke worlds sight

Oh , from thy crowne of glory dart one flame
May strike a sacred reverence , whilest thy name

( Like holy flamens to their god of day
We bowing , sing ; and whilst we praise , we pray

Bright spirit ! whose aeternal motion
Of wit , like Time , stil in it selfe did run

Binding all others in it , and did give
Commission , how far this or that shal live

Like DESTINY of poems who , as she
Signes death to all , her selfe cam never dye

And now thy purple-robed Traegedy
In her imbroider 'd buskins , cals mine eye

Where the brave Aetius we see betrayed
T ' obey his death , whom thousand lives obeyed

Whilst that the mighty foole his scepter breakes
And through his gen'rals wounds his own doome speakes

Weaving thus richly VALENTINIAN
The costliest monarch with the cheapest man

Souldiers may here to their old glories adde
The LOVER love , and be with reason MAD

Not , as of old , Alcides furious
Who wilder then his bull did teare the house

( Hurling his language with the canvas stone
Twas thought the monster ror 'd the sob'rer tone

But ah ! when thou thy sorrow didst inspire
With passions , blacke as is her darke attire

Virgins as sufferers have wept to see
So white a soule , so red a crueltie

That thou hast griev 'd , and with unthought redresse
Dri 'd their wet eyes who now thy mercy blesse

Yet , loth to lose thy watry jewell , when
Joy wip't it off , laughter straight sprung't agen

Now ruddy checked Mirth with rosie wings
Fans ev'ry brow with gladnesse , whilst she sings

Delight to all , and the whole theatre
A festivall in heaven doth appeare

Nothing but pleasure , love ; and ( like the morne
Each face a gen'ral smiling doth adorne

Heare ye , foul speakers , that pronounce the aire
Of stewes and shores , I will informe you where

And how to cloath aright your wanton wit
Without her nasty bawd attending it

View here a loose thought sayd with such a grace
Minerva might have spoke in Venus face

So well disguis 'd , that 't was conceiv 'd by none
But Cupid had Diana 's linnen on

And all his naked parts so vail 'd , th ' expresse
The shape with clowding the uncomlinesse

That if this Reformation , which we
Receiv 'd , had not been buried with thee

The stage ( as this worke ) might have liv 'd and loved
Her lines , the austere Skarlet had approved

And th ' actors wisely been from that offence
As cleare , as they are now from audience

Thus with thy Genius did the scaene expire
Wanting thy active and correcting fire

That now ( to spread a darknesse over all
Nothing remaines but Poesie to fall

And though from these thy Embers we receive
Some warmth , so much as may be said , we live

That we dare praise thee blushlesse , in the head
Of the best piece Hermes to Love e 're read

That we rejoyce and glory in thy wit
And feast each other with remembring it

That we dare speak thy thought , thy acts recite
Yet all men henceforth be afraid to write

LUCASTA ( fair , but hapless maid
Once flourisht underneath the shade

Of your illustrious Mother ; now
An orphan grown , she bows to you

To you , her vertues ' noble heir
Oh may she find protection there

Nor let her welcome be the less
'Cause a rough hand makes her address

One ( to whom foes the Muses are
Born and bred up in rugged war

For , conscious how unfit I am
I only have pronounc 'd her name

To waken pity in your brest
And leave her tears to plead the rest

H ' has left his apish jigs
And whipping hearts like gigs

For t ' other day I heard him swear
That beauty should be crown 'd in honours chair

Love Justice is become
And doth the cruel doome

Reversed is the old decree
Behold ! he sits inthron 'd with majestie

Whilst to his altars now
The frozen vestals bow

And strickt Diana too doth go
A-hunting with his fear 'd , exchanged bow

This is a miracle
That might religion swell

But she , that these and their god awes
Her crowned self submits to her own laws

Twas not for some calm blessing to deceive
Thou didst thy polish 'd hands in shagg 'd furs weave

It were no blessing thus obtained
Thou rather would'st a curse have gained

Not that you feared the discolo'ring cold
Might alchymize their silver into gold

Nor could your ten white nuns so sin
That you should thus pennance them in

Nor , Hero-like who , on their crest still wore
A lyon , panther , leopard , or a bore

To looke their enemies in their herse
Thou would'st thy hand should deeper pierce

No , no , LUCASTA , destiny decreed
That beasts to thee a sacrifice should bleed

And strip themselves to make you gay
For ne ' r yet herald did display

This for lay-lovers , that must stand at dore
Salute the threshold , and admire no more

But I , in my invention tough
Rate not this outward bliss enough

LADIES turn conjurers , and can impart
The hidden mystery of the black art

Black artificial patches do betray
They more affect the works of night than day

The creature strives the Creator to disgrace
By patching that which is a perfect face

A little stain upon the purest dye
Is both offensive to the heart and eye

Defile not then with spots that face of snow
Where the wise God His workmanship doth show

The light of nature and the light of grace
Is the complexion for a lady 's face

As I beheld a winter 's evening air
Curl 'd in her court-false-locks of living hair

Galliard and clinquant she appear 'd to give
A serenade or ball to us that grieve

But as a Moor , who to her cheeks prefers
White spots , t ' allure her black idolaters

Like the dark front of some Ethiopian queen
Vailed all ore with gems of red , blew , green

Whilst the fond people offer 'd sacrifice
To saphyrs , 'stead of veins and arteries

Behold LUCASTA 'S face , how't glows like noon
A sun intire is her complexion

So gently shining , so serene , so cleer
Her look doth universal Nature cheer

I laugh and sing , but can not tell
Whether the folly o n't sounds well

But then I groan
Methinks , in tune

Whilst grief , despair and fear dance to the air
Of my despised prayer

A pretty antick love does this
Then strikes a galliard with a kiss

As in the end
The chords they rend

So you but with a touch from your fair hand
Turn all to saraband

Like to the sent'nel stars , I watch all night
For still the grand round of your light

And glorious breast
Awake in me an east

Now on my down I 'm toss 'd as on a wave
And my repose is made my grave

Fluttering I lye
Do beat my self and dye

Ah , my fair murdresse ! dost thou cruelly heal
With various pains to make me well

Then let me be
Thy cut anatomie

I ' th ' autumn of a summer 's day
When all the winds got leave to play

LUCASTA , that fair ship , is lanched
And from its crust this almond blanched

Blow then , unruly northwind , blow
'Till in their holds your eyes you stow

And swell your cheeks , bequeath chill death
See ! she hath smil 'd thee out of breath

Court , gentle zephyr , court and fan
Her softer breast 's carnation wan

Your charming rhethorick of down
Flyes scatter 'd from before her frown

Say , my white water-lilly , say
How is't those warm streams break away

Cut by thy chast cold breast , which dwells
Amidst them arm 'd in isicles

And the hot floods , more raging grown
In flames of thee then in their own

In their distempers wildly glow
And kisse thy pillar of fix 'd snow

No sulphur , through whose each blew vein
The thick and lazy currents strein

Can cure the smarting nor the fell
Blisters of love , wherewith they swell

These great physicians of the blind
The lame , and fatal blains of Inde

In every drop themselves now see
Speckled with a new leprosie

As sick drinks are with old wine dashed
Foul waters too with spirits washed

Thou greiv 'd , perchance , one tear let'st fall
Which straight did purifie them all

And now is cleans 'd enough the flood
Which since runs cleare as doth thy blood

Of the wet pearls uncrown thy hair
And mantle thee with ermin air

Lucasta , hail ! fair conqueresse
Of fire , air , earth and seas

Thou whom all kneel to , yet even thou
Wilt unto love , thy captive , bow

Down with thy double load of that one grain
It is a granarie for all thy train

And thou , almighty foe , lay by thy sting
Whilst thy unpay 'd musicians , crickets , sing

Ant , to work still ! age will thee truant call
And to save now , th'art worse than prodigal

Not all thy life-time one poor minute live
And thy ore-labour 'd bulk with mirth relieve

Thy self and storehouse now they do store up
And thy whole harvest too within their crop

So scattering to hord 'gainst a long day
Thinking to save all , we cast all away

Strive not , vain lover , to be fine
Thy silk 's the silk-worm 's , and not thine

You lessen to a fly your mistriss ' thought
To think it may be in a cobweb caught

What , though her thin transparent lawn
Thy heart in a strong net hath drawn

Not all the arms the god of fire ere made
Can the soft bulwarks of nak 'd love invade

Be truly fine , then , and yourself dress
In her fair soul 's immac'late glass

Then by reflection you may have the bliss
Perhaps to see what a true fineness is

When all your gawderies will fit
Those only that are poor in wit

She that a clinquant outside doth adore
Dotes on a gilded statue and no more

True lasting heavenly fuel
Puts out the vestal jewel

When once we twining marry
Mad love with wild canary

Milk lightning still asswageth
So when our fury rageth

As th ' only means to cross it
Wee ' l drown it in love 's posset

At th ' head of his own barrells
Where broach 'd are all his quarrels

Should a true noble master
Still make his guest his taster

We drink our glass of roses
Which nought but sweets discloses

Then in our loyal chamber
Refresh us with love 's amber

What of Elizium 's missing
Still drinking and still kissing

Adoring plump October
Lord ! what is man , and sober

Let others glory follow
In their false riches wallow

And with their grief be merry
Leave me but love and sherry

In the nativity of time
Chloris ! it was not thought a crime

Now wee make love , as all on fire
Ring retrograde our lowd desire

Thrice happy was that golden age
When complement was constru 'd rage

When cursed NO stain 'd no maid 's blisse
And all discourse was summ 'd in YES

Love then unstinted love did sip
And cherries pluck 'd fresh from the lip

Lasses , like Autumne plums , did drop
And lads indifferently did drop

Then unconfined each did tipple
Wine from the bunch , milk from the nipple

Then equally the wholsome jellies
Were squeez 'd from olive-trees and bellies

A fragrant bank of strawberries
Diaper 'd with violets ' eyes

No palace to the clouds did swell
Each humble princesse then did dwell

Both broken faith and th ' cause of it
All-damning gold , was damn 'd to th ' pit

Lasted until that extreem day
In which they smil 'd their souls away

Because no fault , there was no tear
No grone did grate the granting ear

No serpent kiss poyson 'd the tast
Each touch was naturally chast

Naked as their own innocence
And unembroyder 'd from offence

On softer than the cignet 's down
In beds they tumbled off their own

Thus did they live : thus did they love
Repeating only joyes above

Which they would put off cheerfully
To bathe them in the Galaxie

Now , Chloris ! miserably crave
The offer 'd blisse you would not have

Whilst ravish 'd with these noble dreams
And crowned with mine own soft beams

And why an honour 'd ragged shirt , that shows
Like tatter 'd ensigns , all its bodie 's blows

Should it be swathed in a vest so dire
It were enough to set the child on fire

Dishevell 'd queen [ s ] should strip them of their hair
And in it mantle the new rising heir

Nor do I know ought worth to wrap it in
Except my parchment upper-coat of skin

And then expect no end of its chast tears
That first was rowl 'd in down , now furs of bears

But since to ladies 't hath a custome been
Linnen to send , that travail and lye in

To the nine sempstresses , my former friends
I su 'd ; but they had nought but shreds and ends

At last , the jolli'st of the three times three
Rent th ' apron from her smock , and gave it me

'T was soft and gentle , subt'ly spun , no doubt
Pardon my boldnese , madam ; HERE 'S THE CLOUT

I did believe I was in heav'n
When first the heav'n her self was giv'n

That in my heart her beams did passe
As some the sun keep in a glasse

So that her beauties thorow me
Did hurt my rival-enemy

But fate , alas ! decreed it so
That I was engine to my woe

For , as a corner 'd christal spot
My heart diaphanous was not

But solid stuffe , where her eye flings
Quick fire upon the catching strings

Yet , as at triumphs in the night
You see the Prince 's Arms in light

So , when I once was set on flame
I burnt all ore the letters of her name

You are deceiv 'd ; I sooner may , dull fair
Seat a dark Moor in Cassiopea 's chair

Or on the glow-worm 's uselesse light
Bestow the watching flames of night

Or give the rose 's breath
To executed death

Ere the bright hiew
Of verse to you

It is just Heaven on beauty stamps a fame
And we , alas ! its triumphs but proclaim

What chains but are too light for me , should I
Say that Lucasta in strange arms could lie

Or that Castara were impure
Or Saccarisa 's faith unsure

That Chloris ' love , as hair
Embrac 'd each en'mies air

That all their good
Ran in their blood

'T is the same wrong th ' unworthy to inthrone
As from her proper sphere t ' have vertue thrown

That strange force on the ignoble hath renown
As AURUM FULMINANS , it blows vice down

'Twere better ( heavy one ) to crawl
Forgot , then raised , trod on [ to ] fall

All your defections now
Are not writ on your brow

Odes to faults give
A shame must live

When a fat mist we view , we coughing run
But , that once meteor drawn , all cry : undone

How bright the fair Paulina did appear
When hid in jewels she did seem a star

But who could soberly behold
A wicked owl in cloath of gold

Or the ridiculous Ape
In sacred Vesta 's shape

So doth agree
Just praise with thee

For since thy birth gave thee no beauty , know
No poets pencil must or can do so

And battered the windows of mine eyes
And took my heart for one of 's nunneries

He said that , by the law , the challeng 'd might
Take the advantage both of arms and fight

So we both met in one of 's mother 's groves
The time , at the first murm'ring of her doves

For when my arm to its true distance came
I nothing touch 'd but a fantastick flame

The only way t ' undo this enemy
Is to laugh at the boy , and he will cry

What , so beyond all madnesse is the elf
Now he hath got out of himself

His fatal enemy the Bee
Nor his deceiv 'd artillerie

His shackles , nor the roses bough
Ne ' r half so netled him , as he is now

See ! at 's own mother he is offering
His finger now fits any ring

Old Cybele he would enjoy
And now the girl , and now the boy

He proffers Jove a back caresse
And all his love in the antipodes

Jealous of his chast Psyche , raging he
Quarrels with student Mercurie

And with a proud submissive breath
Offers to change his darts with Death

He strikes at the bright eye of day
And Juno tumbles in her milky way

The dear sweet secrets of the gods he tells
And with loath 'd hate lov 'd heaven he swells

Now , like a fury , he belies
Myriads of pure virginities

And swears , with this false frenzy hurled
There 's not a vertuous she in all the world

Olympus he renownces , then descends
And makes a friendship with the fiends

Bids Charon be no more a slave
He Argos rigg 'd with stars shall have

And triple Cerberus from below
Must leash 'd t ' himself with him a hunting go

Small type of great ones , that do hum
Within this whole world 's narrow room

That with a busie hollow noise
Catch at the people 's vainer voice

And with spread sails play with their breath
Whose very hails new christen death

Poor Fly , caught in an airy net
Thy wings have fetter 'd now thy feet

Where , like a Lyon in a toyl
Howere thou keep'st a noble coyl

And beat'st thy gen'rous breast , that o 're
The plains thy fatal buzzes rore

Till thy all-bellyd foe ( round elf
Hath quarter 'd thee within himself

Was it not better once to play
I ' th ' light of a majestick ray

Where , though too neer and bold , the fire
Might sindge thy upper down attire

And thou i ' th ' storm to loose an eye
A wing , or a self-trapping thigh

Yet hadst thou fal'n like him , whose coil
Made fishes in the sea to broyl

When now th'ast scap 'd the noble flame
Trapp 'd basely in a slimy frame

And free of air , thou art become
Slave to the spawn of mud and lome

Nor is't enough thy self do 's dresse
To thy swoln lord a num'rous messe

And by degrees thy thin veins bleed
And piecemeal dost his poyson feed

But now devour 'd , art like to be
A net spun for thy familie

And , straight expanded in the air
Hang'st for thy issue too a snare

Strange witty death and cruel ill
That , killing thee , thou thine dost kill

Like pies , in whose entombed ark
All fowl crowd downward to a lark

Thou art thine en'mies ' sepulcher
And in thee buriest , too , thine heir

Yet Fates a glory have reserved
For one so highly hath deserved

As the rhinoceros doth dy
Under his castle-enemy

As through the cranes trunk throat doth speed
The aspe doth on his feeder feed

Fall yet triumphant in thy woe
Bound with the entrails of thy foe

Forbear this liquid fire , Fly
It is more fatal then the dry

That singly , but embracing , wounds
And this at once both burns and drowns

The salamander , that in heat
And flames doth cool his monstrous sweat

Whose fan a glowing cake is said
Of this red furnace is afraid

Viewing the ruby-christal shine
Thou tak'st it for heaven-christalline

Anon thou wilt be taught to groan
'T is an ascended Acheron

A snow-ball heart in it let fall
And take it out a fire-ball

Ali icy breast in it betrayed
Breaks a destructive wild granade

'T is this makes Venus altars shine
This kindles frosty Hymen 's pine

When the boy grows old in his desires
This flambeau doth new light his fires

Though the cold hermit over wail
Whose sighs do freeze , and tears drop hail

Once having pass 'd this , will ne ' r
Another flaming purging fear

The vestal drinking this doth burn
Now more than in her fun'ral urn

Her fires , that with the sun kept race
Are now extinguish 'd by her face

The chymist , that himself doth still
Let him but tast this limbecks bill

And prove this sublimated bowl
He 'll swear it will calcine a soul

Noble , and brave ! now thou dost know
The false prepared decks below

Dost thou the fatal liquor sup
One drop , alas ! thy barque blowes up

What airy country hast to save
Whose plagues thou'lt bury in thy grave

For even now thou seem'st to us
On this gulphs brink a Curtius

And now th ' art faln ( magnanimous Fly
In , where thine Ocean doth fry

Like the Sun 's son , who blush 'd the flood
To a complexion of blood

Yet , see ! my glad auricular
Redeems thee ( though dissolv 'd ) a star

Flaggy thy wings , and scorch 'd thy thighs
Thou ly'st a double sacrifice

And now my warming , cooling breath
Shall a new life afford in death

See ! in the hospital of my hand
Already cur 'd , thou fierce do'st stand

Burnt insect ! dost thou reaspire
The moist-hot-glasse and liquid fire

I see 't is such a pleasing pain
Thou would'st be scorch 'd and drown 'd again

Mongst the worlds wonders , there doth yet remain
One greater than the rest , that 's all those o 're again

And her own self beside : A Lady , whose soft breast
Is with vast honours soul and virtues life possest

Fair as original light first from the chaos shot
When day in virgin-beams triumph 'd , and night was not

And as that breath infus 'd in the new-breather good
When ill unknown was dumb , and bad not understood

Chearful , as that aspect at this world 's finishing
When cherubims clapp 'd wings , and th ' sons of Heaven did sing

Chast as th ' Arabian bird , who all the ayr denyes
And ev'n in flames expires , when with her selfe she lyes

Oh ! she 's as kind as drops of new faln April showers
That on each gentle breast spring fresh perfuming flowers

She 's constant , gen'rous , fixt ; she 's calm , she is the all
We can of vertue , honour , faith , or glory call

And she is ( whom I thus transmit to endless fame
Mistresse oth ' world and me , and LAURA is her name

Upon a day , when the Dog-star
Unto the world proclaim 'd a war

And poyson bark 'd from black throat
And from his jaws infection shot

Under a deadly hen-bane shade
With slime infernal mists are made

Met the two dreaded enemies
Having their weapons in their eyes

First from his den rolls forth that load
Of spite and hate , the speckl 'd toad

And from his chaps a foam doth spawn
Such as the loathed three heads yawn

Defies his foe with a fell spit
To wade through death to meet with it

Then in his self the lymbeck turns
And his elixir 'd poyson urns

Arachne , once the fear oth ' maid
Coelestial , thus unto her prayed

Heaven 's blew-ey 'd daughter , thine own mother
The Python-killing Sun 's thy brother

Oh ! thou , from gods that didst descend
With a poor virgin to contend

Shall seed of earth and hell ere be
A rival in thy victorie

Pallas assents : for now long time
And pity had clean rins 'd her crime

When straight she doth with active fire
Her many legged foe inspire

Have you not seen a charact lie
A great cathedral in the sea

Under whose Babylonian walls
A small thin frigot almshouse stalls

So in his slime the toad doth float
And th ' spyder by , but seems his boat

And now the naumachie begins
Close to the surface her self spins

Arachne , when her foe lets flye
A broad-side of his breath too high

That 's over-shot , the wisely-stout
Advised maid doth tack about

And now her pitchy barque doth sweat
Chaf 'd in her own black fury wet

Lasie and cold before , she brings
New fires to her contracted stings

And with discolour 'd spumes doth blast
The herbs that to their center hast

Now to the neighb'ring henbane top
Arachne hath her self wound up

And thence , from its dilated leaves
By her own cordage downwards weaves

And doth her town of foe attack
And storms the rampiers of his back

Which taken in her colours spread
March to th ' citadel of 's head

Now as in witty torturing Spain
The brain is vext to vex the brain

Where hereticks bare heads are armed
In a close helm , and in it charmed

An overgrown and meagre rat
That peece-meal nibbles himself fat

So on the toads blew-checquer 'd scull
The spider gluttons her self full

And vomiting her Stygian seeds
Her poyson on his poyson feeds

Thus the invenom 'd toad , now grown
Big with more poyson than his own

Doth gather all his pow'rs , and shakes
His stormer in 's disgorged lakes

And wounded now , apace crawls on
To his next plantane surgeon

With whose rich balm no sooner drest
But purged is his sick swoln breast

And as a glorious combatant
That only rests awhile to pant

Then with repeated strength and scars
That smarting fire him new to wars

Deals blows that thick themselves prevent
As they would gain the time he spent

So the disdaining angry toad
That calls but a thin useless load

His fatal feared self comes back
With unknown venome fill 'd to crack

Th ' amased spider , now untwined
Hath crept up , and her self new lined

With fresh salt foams and mists , that blast
The ambient air as they past

And now me thinks a Sphynx 's wing
I pluck , and do not write , but sting

With their black blood my pale inks blent
Gall 's but a faint ingredient

The pol'tick toad doth now withdraw
Warn 'd , higher in CAMPANIA

There wisely doth , intrenched deep
His body in a body keep

And leaves a wide and open pass
T ' invite the foe up to his jaws

Which there within a foggy blind
With fourscore fire-arms were lined

The gen'rous active spider doubts
More ambuscadoes than redoubts

So within shot she doth pickear
Now gall 's the flank , and now the rear

As that the toad in 's own dispite
Must change the manner of his fight

Who , like a glorious general
With one home-charge lets fly at all

Chaf 'd with a fourfold ven'mous foam
Of scorn , revenge , his foes and 's own

He seats him in his loathed chair
New-made him by each mornings air

With glowing eyes he doth survey
Th ' undaunted hoast he calls his prey

Then his dark spume he gred'ly laps
And shows the foe his grave , his chaps

Whilst the quick wary Amazon
Of 'vantage takes occasion

And with her troop of leggs carreers
In a full speed with all her speers

Down ( as some mountain on a mouse
On her small cot he flings his house

Without the poyson of the elf
The toad had like t ' have burst himself

For sage Arachne with good heed
Had stopt herself upon full speed

And , 's body now disorder 'd , on
She falls to execution

The passive toad now only can
Contemn and suffer . Here began

The wronged maids ingenious rage
Which his heart venome must asswage

One eye she hath spet out , strange smother
When one flame doth put out another

And one eye wittily spar 'd , that he
Might but behold his miserie

She on each spot a wound doth print
And each speck hath a sting withi n't

Till he but one new blister is
And swells his own periphrasis

Then fainting , sick , and yellow-pale
She baths him with her sulph'rous stale

Thus slacked is her Stygian fire
And she vouchsafes now to retire

Anon the toad begins to pant
Bethinks him of th ' almighty plant

And lest he peece-meal should be sped
Wisely doth finish himself dead

Whilst the gay girl , as was her fate
Doth wanton and luxuriate

And crowns her conqu'ring head all or
With fatal leaves of hellebore

Not guessing at the pretious aid
Was lent her by the heavenly maid

The neer expiring toad now rowls
Himself in lazy bloody scrowls

To th ' sov'raign salve of all his ills
That only life and health distills

But loe ! a terror above all
That ever yet did him befall

Pallas , still mindful of her foe
( Whilst they did with each fires glow

Had to the place the spiders lar
Dispath 'd before the ev'nings star

He learned was in Natures laws
Of all her foliage knew the cause

And 'mongst the rest in his choice want
Unplanted had this plantane plant

The all-confounded toad doth see
His life fled with his remedie

And in a glorious despair
First burst himself , and next the air

Then with a dismal horred yell
Beats down his loathsome breath to hell

But what inestimable bliss
This to the sated virgin is

Who , as before of her fiend foe
Now full is of her goddess too

She from her fertile womb hath spun
Her stateliest pavillion

Whilst all her silken flags display
And her triumphant banners play

Where Pallas she ith ' midst doth praise
And counterfeits her brothers rayes

Nor will she her dear lar forget
Victorious by his benefit

Whose roof inchanted she doth free
From haunting gnat and goblin bee

Who , trapp 'd in her prepared toyle
To their destruction keep a coyle

Then she unlocks the toad 's dire head
Within whose cell is treasured

That pretious stone , which she doth call
A noble recompence for all

And to her lar doth it present
Of his fair aid a monument

Wise emblem of our politick world
Sage Snayl , within thine own self curled

Instruct me softly to make hast
Whilst these my feet go slowly fast

Compendious Snayl ! thou seem'st to me
Large Euclid 's strict epitome

And in each diagram dost fling
Thee from the point unto the ring

A figure now trianglare
An oval now , and now a square

And then a serpentine , dost crawl
Now a straight line , now crook 'd , now all

Preventing rival of the day
Th ' art up and openest thy ray

And ere the morn cradles the moon
Th ' art broke into a beauteous noon

Then , when the Sun sups in the deep
Thy silver horns e 're Cinthia 's peep

And thou , from thine own liquid bed
New Phoebus , heav'st thy pleasant head

Who shall a name for thee create
Deep riddle of mysterious state

Bold Nature , that gives common birth
To all products of seas and earth

Of thee , as earth-quakes , is afraid
Nor will thy dire deliv'ry aid

Thou , thine own daughter , then , and sire
That son and mother art intire

That big still with thy self dost go
And liv'st an aged embrio

That like the cubbs of India
Thou from thy self a while dost play

But frighted with a dog or gun
In thine own belly thou dost run

And as thy house was thine own womb
So thine own womb concludes thy tomb

But now I must ( analys 'd king
Thy oeconomick virtues sing

Thou great stay 'd husband still within
Thou thee that 's thine dost discipline

And when thou art to progress bent
Thou mov'st thy self and tenement

As warlike Scythians travayl 'd , you
Remove your men and city too

Then , after a sad dearth and rain
Thou scatterest thy silver train

And when the trees grow nak 'd and old
Thou cloathest them with cloth of gold

Which from thy bowels thou dost spin
And draw from the rich mines within

Now hast thou chang 'd thee , saint , and made
Thy self a fane that 's cupulaed

And in thy wreathed cloister thou
Walkest thine own gray fryer too

Strickt and lock 'd up , th'art hood all ore
And ne ' r eliminat'st thy dore

On sallads thou dost feed severe
And 'stead of beads thou drop'st a tear

And when to rest each calls the bell
Thou sleep'st within thy marble cell

Where , in dark contemplation placed
The sweets of Nature thou dost tast

Who now with time thy days resolve
And in a jelly thee dissolve

Like a shot star , which doth repair
Upward , and rarifie the air

The Centaur , Syren , I foregoe
Those have been sung , and lowdly too

Nor of the mixed Sphynx Ile write
Nor the renown 'd Hermaphrodite

Behold ! this huddle doth appear
Of horses , coach and charioteer

That moveth him by traverse law
And doth himself both drive and draw

Then , when the Sunn the south doth winne
He baits him hot in his own inne

I heard a grave and austere clark
Resolv 'd him pilot both and barque

That , like the fam 'd ship of TREVERE
Did on the shore himself lavere

Yet the authentick do beleeve
Who keep their judgement in their sleeve

That he is his own double man
And sick still carries his sedan

Or that like dames i'th land of Luyck
He wears his everlasting huyck

But banisht , I admire his fate
Since neither ostracisme of state

Nor a perpetual exile
Can force this virtue , change his soyl

For , wheresoever he doth go
He wanders with his country too

Sir , your sad absence I complain , as earth
Her long-hid spring , that gave her verdures birth

Who now her cheerful aromatick head
Shrinks in her cold and dismal widow 'd bed

Whilst the false sun her lover doth him move
Below , and to th ' antipodes make love

What fate was mine , when in mine obscure cave
( Shut up almost close prisoner in a grave

Your beams could reach me through this vault of night
And canton the dark dungeon with light

Whence me ( as gen'rous Spahys ) you unbound
Whilst I now know my self both free and crowned

But as at Meccha 's tombe , the devout blind
Pilgrim ( great husband of his sight and mind

Pays to no other object this chast prise
Then with hot earth anoynts out both his eyes

So having seen your dazling glories store
It is enough , and sin for to see more

Or , do you thus those pretious rayes withdraw
To whet my dull beams , keep my bold in aw

Or , are you gentle and compassionate
You will not reach me Regulus his fate

Brave prince ! who , eagle-ey 'd of eagle kind
Wert blindly damn 'd to look thine own self blind

But oh , return those fires , too cruel-nice
For whilst you fear me cindars , see , I 'm ice

A nummed speaking clod and mine own show
My self congeal 'd , a man cut out in snow

Return those living fires . Thou , who that vast
Double advantage from one-ey 'd Heav'n hast

Look with one sun , though 't but obliquely be
And if not shine , vouchsafe to wink on me

Perceive you not a gentle , gliding heat
And quick'ning warmth , that makes the statua sweat

As rev'rend Ducaleon 's black-flung stone
Whose rough outside softens to skin , anon

Each crusty vein with wet red is supplied
Whilst nought of stone but in its heart doth 'bide

So from the rugged north , where your soft stay
Hath stampt them a meridian and kind day

Where now each A LA MODE inhabitant
Himself and 's manners both do pay you rent

And 'bout your house ( your pallace ) doth resort
And 'spite of fate and war creates a court

So from the taught north , when you shall return
To glad those looks that ever since did mourn

When men uncloathed of themselves you ' l see
Then start new made , fit , what they ought to be

Hast ! hast ! you , that your eyes on rare sights feed
For thus the golden triumph is decreed

The twice-born god , still gay and ever young
With ivie crown 'd , first leads the glorious throng

He Ariadne 's starry coronet
Designs for th ' brighter beams of Amoret

Then doth he broach his throne , and singing quaff
Unto her health his pipe of god-head off

Him follow the recanting , vexing Nine
Who , wise , now sing thy lasting fame in wine

Whilst Phoebus , not from th ' east , your feast t ' adorn
But from th ' inspir 'd Canaries , rose this morn

Now you are come , winds in their caverns sit
And nothing breaths , but new-inlarged wit

Hark ! One proclaims it piacle to be sad
And th ' people call 't religion to be mad

But now , as at a coronation
When noyse , the guard , and trumpets are oreblown

The silent commons mark their princes way
And with still reverence both look and pray

So they amaz 'd expecting do adore
And count the rest but pageantry before

Behold ! an hoast of virgins , pure as th ' air
In her first face , ere mists durst vayl her hair

Their snowy vests , white as their whiter skin
Or their far chaster whiter thoughts within

Roses they breath 'd and strew 'd , as if the fine
Heaven did to earth his wreath of swets resign

They sang aloud : `` THRICE , OH THRICE HAPPY , THEY
THAT CAN , LIKE THESE , IN LOVE BOTH YIELD AND SWAY

Next herald Fame ( a purple clowd her bears
In an imbroider 'd coat of eyes and ears

Proclaims the triumph , and these lovers glory
Then in a book of steel records the story

And now a youth of more than god-like form
Did th ' inward minds of the dumb throng alarm

All nak 'd , each part betray 'd unto the eye
Chastly : for neither sex ow 'd he or she

And this was heav'nly love . By his bright hand
A boy of worse than earthly stuff did stand

His bow broke , his fires out , and his wings clipt
And the black slave from all his false flames stript

Whose eyes were new-restor 'd but to confesse
This day 's bright blisse , and his own wretchednesse

Who , swell 'd with envy , bursting with disdain
Did cry to cry , and weep them out again

And now what heav'n must I invade , what sphere
Rifle of all her stars , t ' inthrone her there

No ! Phoebus , by thy boys fate we beware
Th ' unruly flames o'th ' firebrand , thy carr

Although , she there once plac 'd , thou , Sun , shouldst see
Thy day both nobler governed and thee

Drive on , Bootes , thy cold heavy wayn
Then grease thy wheels with amber in the main

And Neptune , thou to thy false Thetis gallop
Appollo 's set within thy bed of scallop

Whilst Amoret , on the reconciled winds
Mounted , and drawn by six caelestial minds

She armed was with innocence and fire
That did not burn ; for it was chast desire

Whilst a new light doth gild the standers by
Behold ! it was a day shot from her eye

Chafing perfumes oth ' East did throng and sweat
But by her breath they melting back were beat

A crown of yet-nere-lighted stars she wore
In her soft hand a bleeding heart she bore

Then a wing 'd crier thrice aloud did call
LET FAME PROCLAIM THIS ONE GREAT PRISE FOR ALL

By her a lady that might be call 'd fair
And justly , but that Amoret was there

Was pris'ner led ; th ' unvalewed robe she wore
Made infinite lay lovers to adore

Who vainly tempt her rescue ( madly bold
Chained in sixteen thousand links of gold

Chrysetta thus ( loaden with treasures ) slave
Did strow the pass with pearls , and her way pave

But loe ! the glorious cause of all this high
True heav'nly state , brave Philamore , draws nigh

Who , not himself , more seems himself to be
And with a sacred extasie doth see

Fix 'd and unmov 'd on 's pillars he doth stay
And joy transforms him his own statua

Nor hath he pow ' r to breath [ n ] or strength to greet
The gentle offers of his Amoret

Who now amaz 'd at 's noble breast doth knock
And with a kiss his gen'rous heart unlock

Whilst she and the whole pomp doth enter there
Whence her nor Time nor Fate shall ever tear

But whether am I hurl 'd ? ho ! back ! awake
From thy glad trance : to thine old sorrow take

Thus , after view of all the Indies store
The slave returns unto his chain and oar

Thus poets , who all night in blest heav'ns dwell
Are call 'd next morn to their true living hell

So I unthrifty , to myself untrue
Rise cloath 'd with real wants , 'cause wanting you

And what substantial riches I possesse
I must to these unvalued dreams confesse

But all our clowds shall be oreblown , when thee
In our horizon bright once more we see

When thy dear presence shall our souls new-dress
And spring an universal cheerfulnesse

When we shall be orewhelm 'd in joy , like they
That change their night for a vast half-year 's day

Then shall the wretched few , that do repine
See and recant their blasphemies in wine

Then shall they grieve , that thought I 've sung too free
High and aloud of thy true worth and thee

And their fowl heresies and lips submit
To th ' all-forgiving breath of Amoret

And me alone their angers object call
That from my height so miserably did fall

And crie out my invention thin and poor
Who have said nought , since I could say no more

Frank , wil't live unhandsomely ? trust not too far
Thy self to waving seas : for what thy star

Calculated by sure event , must be
Look in the glassy-epithete , and see

Yet settle here your rest , and take your state
And in calm halcyon 's nest ev'n build your fate

Prethee lye down securely , Frank , and keep
With as much no noyse the inconstant deep

As its inhabitants ; nay , stedfast stand
As if discover 'd were a New-found-land

Fit for plantation here . Dream , dream still
Lull 'd in Dione 's cradle ; dream , untill

Horrour awake your sense , and you now find
Your self a bubbled pastime for the wind

And in loose Thetis blankets torn and tost
Frank , to undo thy self why art at cost

Nor be too confident , fix 'd on the shore
For even that too borrows from the store

Of her rich neighbour , since now wisest know
( And this to Galileo 's judgement ow

The palsie earth it self is every jot
As frail , inconstant , waveing , as that blot

We lay upon the deep , that sometimes lies
Chang 'd , you would think , with 's botoms properties

But this eternal , strange Ixion 's wheel
Of giddy earth ne'er whirling leaves to reel

Till all things are inverted , till they are
Turn 'd to that antick confus 'd state they were

Who loves the golden mean , doth safely want
A cobwebb 'd cot and wrongs entail 'd upo n't

He richly needs a pallace for to breed
Vipers and moths , that on their feeder feed

The toy that we ( too true ) a mistress call
Whose looking-glass and feather weighs up all

And cloaths which larks would play with in the sun
That mock him in the night , when 's course is run

To rear an edifice by art so high
That envy should not reach it with her eye

Nay , with a thought come neer it . Wouldst thou know
How such a structure should be raisd , build low

The blust'ring winds invisible rough stroak
More often shakes the stubborn'st , prop'rest oak

And in proud turrets we behold withal
'T is the imperial top declines to fall

Nor does Heav'n 's lightning strike the humble vales
But high-aspiring mounts batters and scales

A breast of proof defies all shocks of Fate
Fears in the best , hopes in worser state

Heaven forbid that , as of old , time ever
Flourish 'd in spring so contrary , now never

That mighty breath , which blew foul Winter hither
Can eas'ly puffe it to a fairer weather

Why dost despair then , Frank ? Aeolus has
A Zephyrus as well as Boreas

'T is a false sequel , soloecisme 'gainst those
Precepts by fortune giv'n us , to suppose

That , 'cause it is now ill , 't will ere be so
Apollo doth not always bend his bow

But oft , uncrowned of his beams divine
With his soft harp awakes the sleeping Nine

In strictest things magnanimous appear
Greater in hope , howere thy fate , then fear

Draw all your sails in quickly , though no storm
Threaten your ruine with a sad alarm

For tell me how they differ , tell me , pray
A cloudy tempest and a too fair day

Behold ! three sister-wonders , in whom met
Distinct and chast , the splendrous counterfeit

Of Juno , Venus and the warlike Maid
Each in their three divinities arrayed

The majesty and state of Heav'ns great Queen
And when she treats the gods , her noble meen

The sweet victorious beauties and desires
O ' th ' sea-born princess , empresse too of fires

The sacred arts and glorious lawrels torn
From the fair brow o ' th ' goddesse father-born

All these were quarter 'd in each snowy coat
With canton 'd honours of their own , to boot

Paris , by fate new-wak 'd from his dead cell
Is charg 'd to give his doom impossible

He views in each the brav'ry of all Ide
Whilst one , as once three , doth his soul divide

Then sighs so equally they 're glorious all
WHAT PITY THE WHOLE WORLD IS BUT ONE BALL

If Pliny , Lord High Treasurer of all
Natures exchequer shuffled in this our ball

Peinture her richer rival did admire
And cry 'd she wrought with more almighty fire

That judg 'd the unnumber 'd issue of her scrowl
Infinite and various as her mother soul

That contemplation into matter brought
Body 'd Ideas , and could form a thought

Why do I pause to couch the cataract
And the grosse pearls from our dull eyes abstract

That , pow'rful Lilly , now awaken 'd we
This new creation may behold by thee

To thy victorious pencil all , that eyes
And minds call reach , do bow . The deities

Bold Poets first but feign 'd , you do and make
And from your awe they our devotion take

Your beauteous pallet first defin 'd Love 's Queen
And made her in her heav'nly colours seen

You strung the bow of the Bandite her son
And tipp 'd his arrowes with religion

Neptune as unknown as his fish might dwell
But that you seat him in his throne of shell

The thunderers artillery and brand
You fancied Rome in his fantastick hand

And the pale frights , the pains , and fears of hell
First from your sullen melancholy fell

Who cleft th ' infernal dog 's loath 'd head in three
And spun out Hydra 's fifty necks ? by thee

As prepossess 'd w ' enjoy th ' Elizian plain
Which but before was flatter 'd in our brain

Who ere yet view 'd airs child invisible
A hollow voice , but in thy subtile skill

Faint stamm'ring Eccho you so draw , that we
The very repercussion do see

Cheat-HOCUS-POCUS-Nature an assay
O ' th ' spring affords us : praesto , and away

You all the year do chain her and her fruits
Roots to their beds , and flowers to their roots

Have not mine eyes feasted i ' th ' frozen Zone
Upon a fresh new-grown collation

Of apples , unknown sweets , that seem 'd to me
Hanging to tempt as on the fatal tree

So delicately limn 'd I vow 'd to try
My appetite impos 'd upon my eye

You , sir , alone , fame , and all-conqu'ring rime
File the set teeth of all-devouring time

When beauty once thy vertuous paint hath on
Age needs not call her to vermilion

Her beams nere shed or change like th ' hair of day
She scatters fresh her everlasting ray

Nay , from her ashes her fair virgin fire
Ascends , that doth new massacres conspire

Whilst we wipe off the num'rous score of years
And do behold our grandsire [ s ] as our peers

With the first father of our house compare
We do the features of our new-born heir

For though each coppied a son , they all
Meet in thy first and true original

Sacred ! luxurious ! what princesse not
But comes to you to have her self begot

As , when first man was kneaded , from his side
Is born to 's hand a ready-made-up bride

He husband to his issue then doth play
And for more wives remove the obstructed way

So by your art you spring up in two noons
What could not else be form 'd by fifteen suns

Thy skill doth an'mate the prolifick flood
And thy red oyl assimilates to blood

Where then , when all the world pays its respect
Lies our transalpine barbarous neglect

When the chast hands of pow'rful Titian
Had drawn the scourges of our God and man

And now the top of th ' altar did ascend
To crown the heav'nly piece with a bright end

Whilst he , who in seven languages gave law
And always , like the Sun , his subjects saw

Did , in his robes imperial and gold
The basis of the doubtful ladder hold

O Charls ! a nobler monument than that
Which thou thine own executor wert at

When to our huffling Henry there complained
A grieved earl , that thought his honor stained

Away ( frown 'd he ) , for your own safeties , hast
In one cheap hour ten coronets I ' l cast

But Holbeen 's noble and prodigious worth
Onely the pangs of an whole age brings forth

Henry ! a word so princely saving said
It might new raise the ruines thou hast made

O sacred Peincture ! that dost fairly draw
What but in mists deep inward Poets saw

'Twixt thee and an Intelligence no odds
That art of privy council to the gods

By thee unto our eyes they do prefer
A stamp of their abstracted character

Thou , that in frames eternity dost bind
And art a written and a body 'd mind

To thee is ope the Juncto o ' th ' abysse
And its conspiracy detected is

Whilest their cabal thou to our sense dost show
And in thy square paint'st what they threat below

Now , my best Lilly , let 's walk hand in hand
And smile at this un-understanding land

Let them their own dull counterfeits adore
Their rainbow-cloaths admire , and no more

Within one shade of thine more substance is
Than all their varnish 'd idol-mistresses

Whilst great Vasari and Vermander shall
Interpret the deep mystery of all

And I unto our modern Picts shall show
What due renown to thy fair art they owe

In the delineated lives of those
By whom this everlasting lawrel grows

Then , if they will not gently apprehend
Let one great blot give to their fame an end

Whilst no poetick flower their herse doth dresse
But perish they and their effigies

The day is curl 'd about agen
To view the splendor she was in

When first with hallow 'd hands
The holy man knit the mysterious bands

When you two your contracted souls did move
Like cherubims above

As your un-understanding issue now
In a glad sigh , a smile , a tear , a vow

Tell me , O self-reviving Sun
In thy perigrination

Hast thou beheld a pair
Twist their soft beams like these in their chast air

As from bright numberlesse imbracing rayes
Are sprung th ' industrious dayes

And change their fertile eyes with the new morn
A beauteous offspring is shot forth , not born

Be witness then , all-seeing Sun
Old spy , thou that thy race hast run

In full five thousand rings
To thee were ever purer offerings

Sent on the wings of Faith ? and thou , O Night
Curtain of their delight

Have you not mark 'd their coelestial play
And no more peek 'd the gayeties of day

Come then , pale virgins , roses strow
Mingled with Ios as you go

The snowy ox is killed
The fane with pros'lyte lads and lasses filled

You too may hope the same seraphic joy
Old time can not destroy

When , like these , you shall stamp by sympathies
Thousands of new-born-loves with your chaste eyes

Twas a blith prince exchang 'd five hundred crowns
For a fair turnip . Dig , dig on , O clowns

But how this comes about , Fates , can you tell
This more then Maid of Meurs , this miracle

Let me not live , if I think not St. Mark
Has all the oar , as well as beasts , in 's ark

No wonder 't is he marries the rich sea
But to betroth him to nak 'd Poesie

And with a bankrupt muse to merchandise
His treasures beams , sure , have put out his eyes

His conquest at Lepanto I ' l let pass
When the sick sea with turbants night-cap 'd was

And now at Candie his full courage shown
That wan 'd to a wan line the half-half moon

This is a wreath , this is a victorie
Caesar himself would have look 'd pale to see

And in the height of all his triumphs feel
Himself but chain 'd to such a mighty wheel

And now me thinks we ape Augustus state
So ugly we his high worth imitate

Monkey his godlike glories ; so that we
Keep light and form with such deformitie

As I have seen an arrogant baboon
With a small piece of glasse zany the sun

Rome to her bard , who did her battails sing
Indifferent gave to poet and to king

With the same lawrells were his temples fraught
Who best had written , and who best had fought

The self same fame they equally did feel
One 's style ador 'd as much as t ' other 's steel

A chain or fasces she could then afford
The sons of Phoebus , we , an axe or cord

Sometimes a coronet was her renown
And ours , the dear prerogative of a crown

In marble statu 'd walks great Lucan lay
And now we walk , our own pale statua

They the whole year with roses crownd would dine
And we in all December know no wine

Disciplin 'd , dieted , sure there hath bin
Ods 'twixt a poet and a Capuchin

Of princes , women , wine , to sing I see
Is no apocrypha : for to rise high

Commend this olio of this lord 't is fit
Nay , ten to one , but you have part of it

There is that justice left , since you maintain
His table , he should counter-feed your brain

Then write how well he in his sack hath drolled
Straight there 's a bottle to your chamber rolled

Or with embroider 'd words praise his French suit
Month hence 't is yours with his mans , to boot

Or but applaud his boss 'd legs : two to none
But he most nobly doth give you one

Or spin an elegie on his false hair
'T is well , he cries , but living hair is dear

Yet say that out of order ther 's one curl
And all the hopes of your reward you furl

Write a deep epick poem , and you may
As soon delight them as the opera

Where they Diogenes thought in his tub
Never so sowre did look so sweet a club

You that do suck for thirst your black quil 's blood
And chaw your labour 'd papers for your food

I will inform you how and what to praise
Then skin y ' in satin as young Lovelace plaies

Beware , as you would your fierce guests , your lice
To strip the cloath of gold from cherish 'd vice

Rather stand off with awe and reverend fear
Hang a poetick pendant in her ear

Court her as her adorers do their glasse
Though that as much of a true substance has

Whilst all the gall from your wild ink you drain
The beauteous sweets of vertues cheeks to stain

And in your livery let her be known
As poor and tatter 'd as in her own

Nor write , nor speak you more of sacred writ
But what shall force up your arrested wit

Be chast ; religion and her priests your scorn
Whilst the vain fanes of idiots you adorn

It is a mortal errour , you must know
Of any to speak good , if he be so

Rayl , till your edged breath flea your raw throat
And burn remarks on all of gen'rous note

Each verse be an indictment , be not free
Sanctity 't self from thy scurrility

Libel your father , and your dam buffoon
The noblest matrons of the isle lampoon

Whilst Aretine and 's bodies you dispute
And in your sheets your sister prostitute

Yet there belongs a sweetnesse , softnesse too
Which you must pay , but first , pray , know to who

There is a creature , ( if I may so call
That unto which they do all prostrate fall

Term 'd mistress , when they ' r angry ; but , pleas 'd high
It is a princesse , saint , divinity

To this they sacrifice the whole days light
Then lye with their devotion all night

For this you are to dive to the abysse
And rob for pearl the closet of some fish

Arabia and Sabaea you must strip
Of all their sweets , for to supply her lip

And steal new fire from heav'n , for to repair
Her unfledg 'd scalp with Berenice 's hair

As now you 're in your coach : save you , bright sir
( O , spare your thanks ) is not this finer far

Then walk un-hided , when that every stone
Has knock 'd acquaintance with your ankle-bone

When your wing 'd papers , like the last dove , nere
Return 'd to quit you of your hope or fear

But left you to the mercy of your host
And your days fare , a fortified toast

How many battels , sung in epick strain
Would have procur 'd your head thatch from the rain

Not all the arms of Thebes and Troy would get
One knife but to anatomize your meat

A funeral elegie , with a sad boon
Might make you ( hei ! ) sip wine like maccaroon

But if perchance there did a riband come
Not the train-band so fierce with all its drum

Yet with your torch you homeward would retire
And heart'ly wish your bed your fun'ral pyre

With what a fury have I known you feed
Upon a contract and the hopes 't might speed

Not the fair bride , impatient of delay
Doth wish like you the beauties of that day

Hotter than all the roasted cooks you sat
To dresse the fricace of your alphabet

Which sometimes would be drawn dough anagrame
Sometimes acrostick parched in the flame

Then posies stew 'd with sippets , mottos by
Of minced verse a miserable pye

How many knots slip 'd , ere you twist their name
With th ' old device , as both their heart 's the same

Whilst like to drills the feast in your false jaw
You would transmit at leisure to your maw

Then after all your fooling , fat , and wine
Glutton 'd at last , return at home to pine

Tell me , O Sun , since first your beams did play
To night , and did awake the sleeping day

Since first your steeds of light their race did start
Did you ere blush as now ? Oh thou , that art

The common father to the base pissmire
As well as great Alcides , did the fire

From thine owne altar which the gods adore
Kindle the souls of gnats and wasps before

Who would delight in his chast eyes to see
Dormise to strike at lights of poesie

Faction and envy now are downright rage
Once a five-knotted whip there was , the stage

The beadle and the executioner
To whip small errors , and the great ones tear

Now , as er ' e Nimrod the first king , he writes
That 's strongest , th ' ablest deepest bites

The muses weeping fly their hill , to see
Their noblest sons of peace in mutinie

Could there nought else this civil war compleat
But poets raging with poetic heat

Tearing themselves and th ' endlesse wreath , as though
Immortal they , their wrath should be so , too

And doubly fir 'd Apollo burns to see
In silent Helicon a naumachie

Parnassus hears these at his first alarms
Never till now Minerva was in arms

O more then conqu'ror of the world , great Rome
Thy heros did with gentleness or ' e come

Thy foes themselves , but one another first
Whilst envy stript alone was left , and burst

The learn 'd Decemviri , 't is true , did strive
But to add flames to keep their fame alive

Whilst the eternal lawrel hung ith ' air
Nor of these ten sons was there found one heir

Like to the golden tripod , it did pass
From this to this , till 't came to him , whose 't was

Caesar to Gallus trundled it , and he
To Maro : Maro , Naso , unto thee

Naso to his Tibullus flung the wreath
He to Catullus thus did bequeath

This glorious circle , to another round
At last the temples of their god it bound

I might believe at least , that each might have
A quiet fame contented in his grave

Envy the living , not the dead , doth bite
For after death all men receave their right

If it be sacriledge for to profane
Their holy ashes , what is't then their flame

He does that wrong unweeting or in ire
As if one should put out the vestal fire

Let earths four quarters speak , and thou , Sun , bear
Now witnesse for thy fellow-traveller

I was ally 'd , dear Uncle , unto thee
In blood , but thou , alas , not unto me

Your vertues , pow'rs , and mine differ 'd at best
As they whose springs you saw , the east and west

Let me awhile be twisted in thy shine
And pay my due devotions at thy shrine

Might learned Waynman rise , who went with thee
In thy heav'ns work beside divinity

I should sit still ; or mighty Falkland stand
To justifie with breath his pow'rful hand

The glory , that doth circle your pale urn
Might hallow 'd still and undefiled burn

But I forbear . Flames , that are wildly thrown
At sacred heads , curle back upon their own

Sleep , heavenly Sands , whilst what they do or write
Is to give God himself and you your right

There is not in my mind one sullen fate
Of old , but is concentred in our state

Vandall ore-runners , Goths in literature
Ploughmen that would Parnassus new-manure

Ringers of verse that all-in-chime
And toll the changes upon every rime

A mercer now by th ' yard does measure ore
An ode , which was but by the foot before

Deals you an ell of epigram , and swears
It is the strongest and the finest wears

No wonder , if a drawer verses rack
If 't is not his , 't may be the spir't of sack

Whilst the fair bar-maid stroaks the muses teat
For milk to make the posset up compleat

Arise , thou rev'rend shade , great Johnson , rise
Break through thy marble natural disguise

Behold a mist of insects , whose meer breath
Will melt thy hallow 'd leaden house of death

What was Crispinus , that you should defie
The age for him ? He durst not look so high

As your immortal rod , he still did stand
Honour 'd , and held his forehead to thy brand

These scorpions , with which we have to do
Are fiends , not only small but deadly too

Well mightst thou rive thy quill up to the back
And scrue thy lyre 's grave chords , untill they crack

For though once hell resented musick , these
Divels will not , but are in worse disease

How would thy masc'line spirit , father Ben
Sweat to behold basely deposed men

Justled from the prerog'tive of their bed
Whilst wives are per'wig 'd with their husbands head

Each snatches the male quill from his faint hand
And must both nobler write and understand

He to her fury the soft plume doth bow
O pen , nere truely justly slit till now

Now as her self a poem she doth dresse
And curls a line , as she would do a tresse

Powders a sonnet as she does her hair
Then prostitutes them both to publick aire

Nor is 't enough , that they their faces blind
With a false dye ; but they must paint their mind

In meeter scold , and in scann 'd order brawl
Yet there 's one Sapho left may save them all

But now let me recal my passion
Oh ! ( from a noble father , nobler son

You , that alone are the Clarissimi
And the whole gen'rous state of Venice be

It shall not be recorded Sanazar
Shall boast inthron 'd alone this new made star

You , whose correcting sweetnesse hath forbad
Shame to the good , and glory to the bad

Whose honour hath ev'n into vertue tamed
These swarms , that now so angerly I named

Forgive what thus distemper 'd I indite
For it is hard a SATYRE not to write

Yet , as a virgin that heats all her blood
At the first motion of bad understood

Then , at meer thought of fair chastity
Straight cools again the tempests of her sea

So when to you I my devotions raise
All wrath and storms do end in calm and praise

Cleft as the top of the inspired hill
Struggles the soul of my divided quill

Whilst this foot doth the watry mount aspire
That Sinai 's living and enlivening fire

Behold my powers storm 'd by a twisted light
O ' th ' Sun and his , first kindled his sight

And my lost thoughts invoke the prince of day
My right to th ' spring of it and him do pray

Say , happy youth , crown 'd with a heav'nly ray
Of the first flame , and interwreathed bay

Inform my soul in labour to begin
Ios or Anthems , Poeans or a Hymne

Shall I a hecatombe on thy tripod slay
Or my devotions at thy altar pay

While which t ' adore th ' amaz 'd world can not tell
The sublime Urim or deep oracle

Heark ! how the moving chords temper our brain
As when Apollo serenades the main

Old Ocean smooths his sullen furrow 'd front
And Nereids do glide soft measures o n't

Whilst th ' air puts on its sleekest , smoothest face
And each doth turn the others looking-glasse

So by the sinewy lyre now strook we see
Into soft calms all storm of poesie

And former thundering and lightning lines
And verse now in its native lustre shines

How wert thou hid within thyself ! how shut
Thy pretious Iliads lock 'd up in a nut

Not hearing of thee thou dost break out strong
Invading forty thousand men in song

And we , secure in our thin empty heat
Now find ourselves at once surprised and beat

Whilst the most valiant of our wits now sue
Fling down their arms , ask quarter too of you

So cabin 'd up in its disguis 'd coarse rust
And scurf 'd all ore with its unseemly crust

The diamond , from 'midst the humbler stones
Sparkling shoots forth the price of nations

Ye safe unriddlers of the stars , pray tell
By what name shall I stamp my miracle

Thou strange inverted Aeson , that leap'st ore
From thy first infancy into fourscore

That to thine own self hast the midwife played
And from thy brain spring'st forth the heav'nly maid

Thou staffe of him bore him , that bore our sins
Which , but set down , to bloom and bear begins

Thou rod of Aaron , with one motion hurled
Bud'st a perfume of flowers through the world

You strange calcined seeds within a glass
Each species Idaea spring'st as 't was

Bright vestal flame that , kindled but ev'n now
For ever dost thy sacred fires throw

Thus the repeated acts of Nestor 's age
That now had three times ore out-liv 'd the stage

And all those beams contracted into one
Alcides in his cradle hath outdone

But all these flour'shing hiews , with which I die
Thy virgin paper , now are vain as I

For 'bove the poets Heav'n th ' art taught to shine
And move , as in thy proper crystalline

Whence that mole-hill Parnassus thou dost view
And us small ants there dabbling in its dew

Whence thy seraphic soul such hymns doth play
As those to which first danced the first day

Where with a thorn from the world-ransoming wreath
Thou stung , dost antiphons and anthems breathe

Where with an Angels quil dip 'd i ' th ' Lambs blood
Thou sing'st our Pelicans all-saving flood

And bath'st thy thoughts in ever-living streams
Rench 'd from earth 's tainted , fat and heavy steams

There move translated youth inroll 'd i ' th ' quire
That only doth with wholy lays inspire

To whom his burning coach Eliah sent
And th ' royal prophet-priest his harp hath lent

Which thou dost tune in consort unto those
Clap wings for ever at each hallow 'd close

Whilst we , now weak and fainting in our praise
Sick echo ore thy Halleluiahs

I 'm un-ore-clowded , too ! free from the mist
The blind and late Heaven's-eyes great Occulist

Obscured with the false fires of his sceme
Not half those souls are lightned by this theme

Unhappy murmurers , that still repine
( After th ' Eclipse our Sun doth brighter shine

Recant your false grief , and your true joys know
Your blisse is endlesse , as you fear 'd your woe

What fort'nate flood is this ! what storm of wit
Oh , who would live , and not ore-whelm 'd in it

No more a fatal Deluge shall be hurled
This inundation hath sav 'd the world

Once more the mighty Fletcher doth arise
Roab 'd in a vest studded with stars and eyes

Of all his former glories ; his last worth
Imbroiderd with what yet light ere brought forth

See ! in this glad farewel he doth appear
Stuck with the Constellations of his Sphere

Fearing we numb 'd fear 'd no flagration
Hath curl 'd all his fires in this one ONE

Which ( as they guard his hallowed chast urn
The dull aproaching hereticks do burn

Fletcher at his adieu carouses thus
To the luxurious ingenious

As Cleopatra did of old out-vie
Th ' un-numb'red dishes of her Anthony

When ( he at th ' empty board a wonderer
Smiling she calls for pearl and vinegar

First pledges him in 's BREATH , then at one draught
Swallows THREE KINGDOMS of To HIS BEST THOUGHT

Hear , oh ye valiant writers , and subscribe
( His force set by ) y'are conquer 'd by this bribe

Though you hold out your selves , he doth commit
In this a sacred treason in your wit

Although in poems desperately stout
Give up : this overture must buy you out

Thus with some prodigal us'rer 't doth fare
That keeps his gold still vayl 'd , his steel-breast bare

That doth exceed his coffers all but 's eye
And his eyes ' idol the wing 'd Deity

That can not lock his mines with half the art
As some rich beauty doth his wretched heart

Wild at his real poverty , and so wise
To win her , turns himself into a prise

First startles her with th ' emerald Mad-Lover
The ruby Arcas , least she should recover

Her dazled thought , a Diamond he throws
Splendid in all the bright Aspatia 's woes

Then to sum up the abstract of his store
He flings a rope of Pearl of forty more

Ah , see ! the stagg'ring virtue faints ! which he
Beholding , darts his Wealths Epitome

And now , to consummate her wished fall
Shows this one Carbuncle , that darkens all

Thy Odes first their own harmony did break
For singing , troth , is but in tune to speak

Thy royal poem now we may extol
As truly Luna blazon 'd upon Sol

So in your twisted numbers now you thus
Not only stocks perswade , but ravish us

But yet the spoaks , by which they scal 'd so high
Gamble hath wisely laid of UT RE MI

Sir , how unravell 'd is the golden fleece
Men , that could only fool at FOX AND GEESE

Are new-made polititians by thy book
And both can judge and conquer with a look

The hidden fate of princes you unfold
Court , clergy , commons , by your law controled

Strange , serious wantoning all that they
Bluster 'd and clutter 'd for , you PLAY

Tis not from cheap thanks thinly to repay
Th ' immortal grove of thy fair-order 'd bay

Thou planted'st round my humble fane , that I
Stick on thy hearse this sprig of Elegie

Nor that your soul so fast was link 'd in me
That now I 've both , since't has forsaken thee

That thus I stand a Swisse before thy gate
And dare , for such another , time and fate

Alas ! our faiths made different essays
Our Minds and Merits brake two several ways

Justice commands I wake thy learned dust
And truth , in whom all causes center must

Behold ! when but a youth , thou fierce didst whip
Upright the crooked age , and gilt vice strip

A senator praetext , that knew'st to sway
The fasces , yet under the ferula

Rank 'd with the sage , ere blossome did thy chin
Sleeked without , and hair all ore within

Who in the school could'st argue as in schools
Thy lessons were ev'n academie rules

So that fair Cam saw thee matriculate
At once a tyro and a graduate

At nineteen , what ESSAYES have we beheld
That well might have the book of Dogmas swelled

Tough Paradoxes , such as Tully 's , thou
Didst heat thee with , when snowy was thy brow

When thy undown 'd face mov 'd the Nine to shake
And of the Muses did a decad make

What shall I say ? by what allusion bold
NONE BUT THE SUN WAS ERE SO YOUNG AND OLD

Young reverend shade , ascend awhile ! whilst we
Now celebrate this posthume victorie

This victory , that doth contract in death
Ev'n all the pow'rs and labours of thy breath

Like the Judean Hero , in thy fall
Thou pull'st the house of learning on us all

And as that soldier conquest doubted not
Who but one splinter had of Castriot

But would assault ev'n death so strongly charmd
And naked oppose rocks , with his bone armed

So we , secure in this fair relique , stand
The slings and darts shot by each profane hand

These soveraign leaves thou left'st us are become
Sear clothes against all Times infection

Sacred Hierocles , whose heav'nly thought
First acted ore this comment , ere it wrote

Thou hast so spirited , elixir 'd , we
Conceive there is a noble alchymie

That 's turning of this gold to something more
Pretious than gold , we never knew before

Who now shall doubt the metempsychosis
Of the great Author , that shall peruse this

Let others dream thy shadow wandering strays
In th ' Elizian mazes hid with bays

Or that , snatcht up in th ' upper region
'T is kindled there a constellation

I have inform 'd me , and declare with ease
THY SOUL IS FLED INTO HIEROCLES

To pay my love to thee , and pay it so
As honest men should what they justly owe

Were to write better of thy life , then can
The assured'st pen of the most worthy man

Such was thy composition , such thy mind
Improv 'd from vertue , and from vice refined

Thy youth an abstract of the world 's best parts
Invr 'd to arms and exercis 'd to arts

Which , with the vigour of a man , became
Thine and thy countries piramids of fame

Two glorious lights to guide our hopeful youth
Into the paths of honour and of truth

These parts ( so rarely met ) made up in thee
What man should in his full perfection be

So sweet a temper into every sence
And each affection breath 'd an influence

As smooth 'd them to a calme , which still withstood
The ruffling passions of untamed blood

Without a wrinckle in thy face , to show
Thy stable breast could a disturbance know

In fortune humble , constant in mischance
Expert in both , and both serv 'd to advance

Thy name by various trialls of thy spirit
And give the testimony of thy merit

Valiant to envy of the bravest men
And learned to an undisputed pen

Good as the best in both and great , but yet
No dangerous courage nor offensive wit

These ever serv 'd the one for to defend
The other , nobly to advance thy friend

Under which title I have found my name
Fix 'd in the living chronicle of fame

To times succeeding : yet I hence must go
Displeas 'd I can not celebrate thee so

But what respect , acknowledgement and love
What these together , when improv 'd , improve

Call it by any name ( so it express
Ought like a tribute to thy worthyness

And may my bounden gratitude become
LOVELACE , I offer at thy honour 'd tomb

And though thy vertues many friends have bred
To love thee liveing , and lament thee dead

In characters far better couch 'd then these
Mine will not blott thy fame , nor theirs encrease

'T was by thine own great merits rais 'd so high
That , maugre time and fate , it shall not dye

The rose and other fragrant flowers smell best
When they are pluck 'd and worn in hand or brest

So this fair flow ' r of vertue , this rare bud
Of wit , smells now as fresh as when he stood

And in these Posthume-Poems lets us know
He on the banks of Helicon did grow

The beauty of his soul did correspond
With his sweet out-side : nay , it went beyond

Lovelace , the minion of the Thespian dames
Apollo 's darling , born with Enthean flames

Which in his numbers wave and shine so clear
As sparks refracted from rich gemmes appear

Such flames that may inspire , and atoms cast
To make new poets not like him in hast

Pardon ( blest shade ) , that I thus crowd to be
'Mong those that sin unto thy memory

And that I think unvalu 'd reliques spread
And am the first that pillages the dead

Since who would be thy mourner as befits
But an officious sacriledge commits

How my tears strive to do thee fairer right
And from the characters divide my sight

Untill it ( dimmer ) a new torrent swells
And what obscur 'd it , falls my spectacles

As they would not be wept , but weep the eyes
But the weak bubbles of mortalitie

Until our griefs are drawn up by the Sun
And that ( too ) drop the exhalation

How in thy dust we humble now our pride
And bring thee a whole people mortified

For who expects not death , now thou art gone
Shows his low folly , not religion

Can the poetick heaven still hold on
The golden dance , when the first mover 's gon

And the snatch 'd fires ( which circularly hurled
In their strong rapture glimmer to the world

And not stupendiously rather rise
The tapers unto these solemnities

Can the chords move in tune , when thou dost dye
At once their universal harmony

But where Apollo 's harp ( with murmur ) laid
Had to the stones a melody conveyed

They by some pebble summon 'd would reply
In loud results to every battery

Thus do we come unto thy marble room
To eccho from the musick of thy tombe

May we dare speak thee dead , that wouldest be
In thy remove only not such as we

No wonder , the advance is from us hid
Earth could not lift thee higher then it did

And thou , that didst grow up so ever nigh
Art but now gone to immortality

So near to where thou art , thou here didst dwell
The change to thee is less perceptible

Thy but unably-comprehending clay
To what could not be circumscrib 'd , gave way

And the more spacious tennant to return
Crack 'd ( in the two restrain 'd estate ) its urn

That is but left to a successive trust
The soul 's first buried in his bodies dust

Thou more thy self , now thou art less confined
Art not concern 'd in what is left behind

While we sustain the losse that thou art gone
Un-essenc 'd in the separation

And he that weeps thy funerall , in one
Is pious to the widdow 'd nation

And under what ( now ) covert must I sing
Secure as if beneath a cherub 's wing

When thou hast tane thy flight hence , and art nigh
In place to some related hierarchie

Where a bright wreath of glories doth but set
Upon thy head an equal coronet

And thou , above our humble converse gon
Canst but be reach 'd by contemplation

Our lutes ( as thine was touch 'd ) were vocall by
And thence receiv 'd the soul by sympathy

That did above the threds inspiring creep
And with soft whispers broke the am'rous sleep

Which now no more ( mov 'd with the sweet surprise
Awake into delicious rapsodies

But with their silent mistress do comply
And fast in undisturbed slumbers lye

How from thy first ascent thou didst disperse
A blushing warmth throughout the universe

While near the morns Lucasta 's fires did glow
And to the earth a purer dawn did throw

We ever saw thee in the roll of fame
Advancing thy already deathless name

And though it could but be above its fate
Thou would'st , however , super-errogate

Now as in Venice , when the wanton State
Before a Spaniard spread their crowded plate

He made it the sage business of his eye
To find the root of the wild treasury

So lear n't from that exchequer but the more
To rate his masters vegetable ore

Thus when the Greek and Latin muse we read
As but the cold inscriptions of the dead

We to advantage then admired thee
Who did'st live on still with thy poesie

And in our proud enjoyments never knew
The end of the unruly wealth that grew

But now we have the last dear ingots gained
And the free vein ( however rich ) is dreined

Though what thou hast bequeathed us , no space
Of this worlds span of time shall ere embrace

But as who sometimes knew not to conclude
Upon the waters strange vicissitude

Did to the ocean himself commit
That it might comprehend what could not it

So we in our endeavours must out-done
Be swallowed up within thy Helicon

Thou , who art layd up in thy precious cave
And from the hollow spaces of thy grave

We still may mourn in tune , but must alone
Hereafter hope to quaver out a grone

No more the chirping sonnets with shrill notes
Must henceforth volley from our treble throtes

But each sad accent must be humour 'd well
To the deep solemn organ of thy cell

Why should some rude hand carve thy sacred stone
And there incise a cheap inscription

When we can shed the tribute of our tears
So long , till the relenting marble wears

Which shall such order in their cadence keep
That they a native epitaph shall weep

Untill each letter spelt distinctly lyes
Cut by the mystick droppings of our eyes

Me thinks , when kings , prophets , and poets dye
We should not bid men weep , nor ask them why

But the great loss should by instinct impair
The nations , like a pestilential ayr

And in a moment men should feel the cramp
Of grief , like persons poyson 'd with a damp

All things in nature should their death deplore
And the sun look less lovely than before

The fixed stars should change their constant spaces
And comets cast abroad their flagrant faces

Yet still we see princes and poets fall
Without their proper pomp of funerall

Men look about , as if they nere had known
The poets lawrell or the princes crown

Lovelace hath long been dead , and he can be
Oblig 'd to no man for an elegie

Are you all turn 'd to silence , or did he
Retain the only sap of poesie

That kept all branches living ? must his fall
Set an eternal period upon all

So when a spring-tide doth begin to fly
From the green shoar , each neighbouring creek grows dry

But why do I so pettishly detract
An age that is so perfect , so exact

In all things excellent , it is a fame
Or glory to deceased Lovelace name

For he is weak in wit , who doth deprave
Anothers worth to make his own seem brave

And this was not his aim : nor is it mine
I now conceive the scope of their designe

Which is with one consent to bring and burn
Contributary incence on his urn

Where each mans love and fancy shall be tryed
As when great Johnson or brave Shakespear dyed

Wits must unite : for ignorance , we see
Hath got a great train of artillerie

Yet neither shall nor can it blast the fame
And honour of deceased Lovelace name

Whose own LUCASTA can support his credit
Amongst all such who knowingly have read it

But who that praise can by desert discusse
Due to those poems that are posthumous

And if the last conceptions are the best
Those by degrees do much transcend the rest

So full , so fluent , that they richly sute
With Orpheus lire , or with Anacreons lute

And he shall melt his wing , that shall aspire
To reach a fancy or one accent higher

Holland and France have known his nobler parts
And found him excellent in arms and arts

To sum up all , few men of fame but know
He was TAM MARTI , QUAM MERCURIO

Thy pious hand , planting fraternal bayes
Deserving is of most egregious praise

Since 't is the organ doth to us convey
From a descended sun so bright a ray

Clear spirit ! how much we are bound to thee
For this so great a liberalitie

The truer worth of which by much exceeds
The western wealth , which such contention breeds

Like the Infusing-God , from the well-head
Of poesie you have besprinkled

Our brows with holy drops , the very last
Which from your Brother 's happy pen were cast

Yet as the last , the best ; such matchlesse skill
From his divine alembick did distill

Your honour 'd Brother in the Elyzian shade
Will joy to know himself a laureat made

By your religious care , and that his urn
Doth him on earth immortal life return

Your self you have a good physician shown
To his much grieved friends and to your own

In giving this elixir 'd medecine
For greatest grief a soveraign anodine

Sir , from your Brother y ' have convey 'd us bliss
Now , since your genius so concurs with his

Let your own quill our next enjoyments frame
All must be rich , that 's grac 'd with Lovelace name

Great son of Mars , and of Minerva too
With what oblations must we come to woo

Thy sacred soul to look down from above
And see how much thy memory we love

Whose happy pen so pleased amorous ears
And , lifting bright LUCASTA to the sphears

Her in the star-bespangled orb did set
Above fair Ariadnes coronet

Leaving a pattern to succeeding wits
By which to sing forth their Pythonick fits

Shall we bring tears and sighs ? no , no ! then we
Should but bemone our selves for loosing thee

Or else thy happiness seem to deny
Or to repine at thy felicity

Then , whilst we chant out thine immortal praise
Our offerings shall be onely sprigs of bays

And if our tears will needs their brinks out-fly
We ' l weep them forth into an elegy

To tell the world , how deep fates wounded wit
When Atropos the lovely Lovelace hit

How th ' active fire , which cloath 'd thy gen'rous mind
Consum 'd the water , and the earth calcined

Untill a stronger heat by death was given
Which sublimated thy poor soul to heaven

Thou knew'st right well to guide the warlike steed
And yet could'st court the Muses with full speed

And such success , that the inspiring Nine
Have fill 'd their Thespian fountain so with brine

Henceforth we can expect no lyrick lay
But biting satyres through the world must stray

Bellona joyns with fair Erato too
And with the Destinies do keep adoe

Whom thus she queries : could not you awhile
Reprieve his life , until another file

Of poems such as these had been drawn up
The fates reply 'd that thou wert taken up

A sacrifice unto the deities
Since things most perfect please their holy eyes

And that no other victim could be found
With so much learning and true virtue crowned

Since it is so , in peace for ever rest
Tis very just that God should have the best

Lovelace is dead ! then let the world return
To its first chaos , mufled in its urn

The stars and elements together lye
Drench 'd in perpetual obscurity

And the whole machine in confusion be
As immethodick as an anarchie

May the great eye of day weep out his light
Pale Cynthia leave the regiment of night

The galaxia , all in sables dight
Send forth no corruscations to our sight

The Sister-Graces and the sacred Nine
Statu 'd with grief , attend upon his shrine

Whose worth , whose loss , should we but truly rate
'Twould puzzle our arithmetic to state

Th ' accompt of vertu 's so transcendent high
Number and value reach infinity

Did I pronounce him dead ! no , no ! he lives
And from his aromatique cell he gives

Spice-breathed fumes , whose odoriferous scent
( In zephre-gales which never can be spent

Doth spread it self abroad , and much out-vies
The eastern bird in her self-sacrifice

Or Father Phoebus , who to th ' world derives
Such various and such multiformed lives

Took notice that brave Lovelace did inspire
The universe with his Promethean fire

And snatcht him hence , before his thread was spun
En'ving that here should be another Sun

Our great redemption from above did bring
For so the holy sages once did sing

That he our deadly forfeit should release
And with his Father work us a perpetual peace

To sit the midst of Trinal Unity
He laid aside ; and here with us to be

Forsook the Courts of everlasting Day
And chose with us a darksom House of mortal Clay

To welcom him to this his new abode
Now while the Heav'n by the Suns team untrod

Hath took no print of the approching light
And all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright

And lay it lowly at his blessed feet
Have thou the honour first , thy Lord to greet

And joyn thy voice unto the Angel Quire
From out his secret Altar toucht with hallow 'd fire

IT was the Winter wilde
While the Heav'n-born-childe

Nature in aw to him
Had doff't her gawdy trim

It was no season then for her
To wanton with the Sun her lusty Paramour

Only with speeches fair
She woo 'd the gentle Air

And on her naked shame
Pollute with sinfull blame

Confounded , that her Makers eyes
Should look so near upon her foul deformities

But he her fears to cease
Sent down the meek-eyd Peace

Down through the turning sphear
His ready Harbinger

And waving wide her mirtle wand
She strikes a universall Peace through Sea and Land

No War , or Battails sound
Was heard the World around

The hooked Chariot stood
Unstain 'd with hostile blood

And Kings sate still with awfull eye
As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by

But peacefull was the night
Wherin the Prince of light

The Windes with wonder whist
Smoothly the waters kist

Who now hath quite forgot to rave
While Birds of Calm sit brooding on the charmed wave

The Stars with deep amaze
Stand fit in steadfast gaze

And will not take their flight
For all the morning light

But in their glimmering Orbs did glow
Until their Lord himself bespake , and bid them go

And though the shady gloom
Had given day her room

And hid his head for shame
As his inferior flame

He saw a greater Sun appear
Then his bright Throne , or burning Axletree could bear

The Shepherds on the Lawn
Or ere the point of dawn

Full little thought they than
That the mighty Pan

Perhaps their loves , or els their sheep
Was all that did their silly thoughts so busie keep

When such Musick sweet
Their hearts and ears did greet

Divinely-warbled voice
Answering the stringed noise

The Air such pleasure loth to lose
With thousand echo 's still prolongs each heav'nly close

Nature that heard such sound
Beneath the hollow round

Now was almost won
To think her part was don

She knew such harmony alone
Could hold all Heav'n and Earth in happier union

At last surrounds their sight
A globe of circular light

The helmed Cherubim
And sworded Seraphim

Harping in loud and solemn quire
With unexpressive notes to Heav'ns new-born Heir

Such Musick ( as 't is said
Before was never made

While the Creator Great
His constellations set

And cast the dark foundations deep
And bid the weltring waves their oozy channel keep

Ring out ye Crystall sphears
Once bless our human ears

And let your silver chime
Move in melodious time

And with your ninefold harmony
Make up full consort to th'Angelike symphony

For if such holy Song
Enwrap our fancy long

And speckl 'd vanity
Will sicken soon and die

And Hell it self will pass away
And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day

Yea Truth , and Justice then
Will down return to men

And Mercy set between
Thron 'd in Celestiall sheen

And Heav'n as at som festivall
Will open wide the gates of her high Palace Hall

But wisest Fate sayes no
This must not yet be so

That on the bitter cross
Must redeem our loss

Yet first to those ychain 'd in sleep
The Wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep

With such a horrid clang
As on Mount Sinai rang

The aged Earth agast
With terrour of that blast

When at the worlds last session
The dreadfull Judge in middle Air shall spread his throne

And then at last our bliss
Full and perfect is

Th'old Dragon under ground
In straiter limits bound

And wrath to see his Kingdom fail
Swindges the scaly Horrour of his foulded tail

The Oracles are dumm
No voice or hideous humm

Apollo from his shrine
Can no more divine

No nightly trance , or breathed spell
Inspire 's the pale-ey 'd Priest from the prophetic cell

The lonely mountains o 're
And the resounding shore

> From haunted spring , and dale
Edg 'd with poplar pale

With flowre-inwov'n tresses torn
The Nimphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn

In consecrated Earth
And on the holy Hearth

In Urns , and Altars round
A drear , and dying sound

And the chill Marble seems to sweat
While each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat

Peor , and Baalim
Forsake their Temples dim

And mooned Ashtaroth
Heav'ns Queen and Mother both

The Libyc Hammon shrinks his horn
In vain the Tyrian Maids their wounded Thamuz mourn

And sullen Moloch fled
Hath left in shadows dred

In vain with Cymbals ring
They call the grisly king

And Brutish gods of Nile as fast
lsis and Orus , and the Dog Anubis hast

My muse with Angels did divide to sing
But headlong joy is ever on the wing

In Wintry solstice like the shortn 'd light
Soon swallow 'd up in dark and long out-living night

Dangers , and snares , and wrongs , and worse then so
Which he for us did freely undergo

Most perfect Heroe , try 'd in heaviest plight
Of labours huge and hard , too hard for human wight

His starry front low-rooft beneath the skies
O what a Mask was there , what a disguise

Yet more ; the stroke of death he must abide
Then lies him meekly down fast by his Brethrens side

And former sufferings other where are found
Loud o 're the rest Cremona 's Trump doth sound

Me softer airs befit , and softer strings
Of Lute , or Viol still , more apt for mournful things

That Heav'n and Earth are colour 'd with my wo
My sorrows are too dark for day to know

The leaves should all be black wheron I write
And letters where my tears have washt a wannish white

To bear me where the Towers of Salem stood
Once glorious Towers , now sunk in guiltles blood

There doth my soul in holy vision sit
In pensive trance , and anguish , and ecstatick fit

Yet on the softned Quarry would I score
My plaining vers as lively as before

For sure so well instructed are my tears
They would fitly fall in order 'd Characters

Would soon unboosom all their Echoes milde
And I ( for grief is easily beguild

Might think th'infection of my sorrows bound
Had got a race of mourners on som pregnant cloud

THIS rich Marble doth enterr
The honour 'd Wife of Winchester

A Vicounts daughter , an Earls heir
Besides what her vertues fair

Added to her noble birth
More then she could own from Earth

Summers three times eight save one
She had told , alas too soon

After so short time of breath
To house with darknes , and with death

Yet had the number of her days
Bin as compleat as was her praise

Nature and fate had had no strife
In giving limit to her life

Her high birth , and her graces sweet
Quickly found a lover meet

The Virgin quire for her request
The God that sits at marriage feast

He at their invoking came
But with a scarce-wel-lighted flame

And in his Garland as he stood
Ye might discern a Cipress bud

Once had the early Matrons run
To greet her of a lovely son

And now with second hope she goes
And calls Lucina to her throws

But whether by mischance or blame
Atropos for Lucina came

And with remorsles cruelty
Spoil 'd at once both fruit and tree

The haples Babe before his birth
Had burial , yet not laid in earth

And the languisht Mothers Womb
Was not long a living Tomb

So have I seen som tender slip
Sav 'd with care from Winters nip

The pride of her carnation train
Pluck't up by som unheedy swain

Who onely thought to crop the flowr
New shot up from vernall showr

But the fair blossom hangs the head
Side-ways as on a dying bed

And those Pearls of dew she wears
Prove to be presaging tears

Which the sad morn had let fall
On her hast'ning funerall

Gentle Lady may thy grave
Peace and quiet ever have

After this thy travail sore
Sweet rest sease thee evermore

That to give the world encrease
Shortned hast thy own lives lease

Here besides the sorrowing
That thy noble House doth bring

Here be tears of perfect moan
Weept for thee in Helicon

And som Flowers , and som Bays
For thy Hears to strew the ways

Sent thee from the banks of Came
Devoted to thy vertuous name

Whilst thou bright Saint high sit'st in glory
Next her much like to thee in story

That fair Syrian Shepherdess
Who after yeers of barrennes

The highly favour 'd Joseph bore
To him that serv 'd for her before

And at her next birth much like thee
Through pangs fled to felicity

Far within the boosom bright
of blazing Majesty and Light

There with thee , new welcom Saint
Like fortunes may her soul acquaint

With thee there clad in radiant sheen
No Marchioness , but now a Queen

WHAT needs my Shakespear for his honour 'd Bones
The labour of an age in piled Stones

Or that his hallow 'd reliques should be hid
Under a Star-ypointing Pyramid

Dear son of memory , great heir of Fame
What need'st thou such weak witnes of thy name

Thou in our wonder and astonishment
Hast built thy self a live-long Monument

For whilst to th'sharne of slow-endeavouring art
Thy easie numbers flow , and that each heart

Hath from the Leaves of thy unvalu 'd Book
Those Delphick lines with deep impression took

Then thou our fancy of it self bereaving
Dost make us Marble with too much conceaving

And so Sepulcher 'd in such pomp dost lie
That Kings for such a Tomb would wish to die

HERE lies old Hobson , Death hath broke his girt
And here alas , hath laid him in the dirt

Or els the ways being foul , twenty to one
He 's here stuck in a slough , and overthrown

'T was such a shifter , that if truth were known
Death was half glad when he had got him down

For he had any time this ten yeers full
Dodg 'd with him , betwixt Cambridge and the Bull

And surely , Death could never have prevailed
Had not his weekly cours of carriage failed

But lately finding him so long at home
And thinking now his journeys end was come

And that he had tane up his latest Inne
In the kind office of a Chamberlin

Shew 'd him his room where he must lodge that night
Pull 'd off his Boots , and took away the light

If any ask for him , it shall be sed
Hobson has supt , and 's newly gon to bed

HERE lieth one who did most truly prove
That he could never die while he could move

So hung his destiny never to rot
While he might still jogg on , and keep his trot

Made of sphear-metal , never to decay
Untill his revolution was at stay

Time numbers motion , yet ( without a crime
'Gainst old truth ) motion number 'd out his time

And like an Engin mov 'd with wheel and waight
His principles being ceast , he ended strait

Rest that gives all men life , gave him his death
And too much breathing put him out of breath

Nor were it contradiction to affirm
Too long vacation hastned on his term

Meerly to drive the time away he sickned
Fainted , and died , nor would with Ale be quickned

Nay , quoth he , on his swooning bed out-stretched
If I may not carry , sure Ile ne 're be fetched

But vow though the cross Doctors all stood hearers
For one Carrier put down to make six bearers

Ease was his chief disease , and to judge right
He di 'd for heavines that his Cart went light

His leasure told him that his time was com
And lack of load , made his life burdensom

That even to his last breath ( ther be that say't
As he were prest to death , he cry 'd more waight

But had his doings lasted as they were
He had bin an immortall Carrier

Obedient to the Moon he spent his date
In cours reciprocal , and had his fate

Linkt to the mutual flowing of the Seas
Yet ( strange to think ) his wain was his increase

His Letters are deliver 'd all and gon
Onely remains this superscription

Where brooding darknes spreads his jealous wings
And the night-Raven sings

There under Ebon shades and low-brow 'd Rocks
As ragged as thy Locks

But com thou Goddes fair and free
In Heav'n ycleap 'd Euphrosyne

And by men , heart-easing Mirth
Whom lovely Venus at a birth

With two sister Graces more
To Ivy-crowned Bacchus bore

Or whether ( as som Sager sing
The frolick Wind that breathes the Spring

Zephir with Aurora playing
As he met her once a Maying

There on Beds of Violets blew
And fresh-blown Roses washt in dew

Fill 'd her with thee a daughter fair
So bucksom , blith , and debonair

Haste thee nymph , and bring with thee
Jest and youthful Jollity

Quips and Cranks , and wanton Wiles
Nods , and Becks , and Wreathed Smiles

Such as hang on Hebe 's cheek
And love to live in dimple sleek

Sport that wrincled Care derides
And Laughter holding both his sides

Com , and trip it as ye go
On the light fantastick toe

And in thy right hand lead with thee
The Mountain Nymph , sweet Liberty

And if I give thee honour due
Mirth , admit me of thy crue

To live with her , and live with thee
In unreproved pleasures free

To hear the Lark begin his flight
And singing startle the dull night

> From his watch-towre in the skies
Till the dappled dawn doth rise

Then to com in spight of sorrow
And at my window bid good morrow

Through the Sweet-Briar , or the Vine
Or the twisted Eglantine

While the Cock with lively din
Scatters the rear of darknes thin

And to the stack , or the Barn dore
Stoutly struts his Dames before

Oft list'ning how the Hounds and horn
Chearly rouse the slumbring morn

> From the side of som Hoar Hill
Through the high wood echoing shrill

Som time walking not unseen
By Hedge-row Elms , on Hillocks green

Right against the Eastern gate
Wher the great Sun begins his state

Rob 'd in flames , and Amber light
The clouds in thousand Liveries dight

While the Plowman neer at hand
Whistles ore the Furrow 'd Land

And the Milkmaid singeth blithe
And the Mower whets his sithe

And every Shepherd tells his tale
Under the Hawthorn in the dale

Streit mine eye hath caught new pleasures
Whilst the Lantskip round it measures

Russet Lawns , and Fallows Gray
Where the nibling flocks do stray

Mountains on whose barren brest
The labouring clouds do often rest

Meadows trim with Daisies pide
Shallow Brooks , and Rivers wide

Towers , and Battlements it sees
Boosom 'd high in tufted Trees

Wher perhaps som beauty lies
The Cynosure of neighbouring eyes

Hard by , a Cottage chimney smokes
> From betwixt two aged Okes

Where Corydon and Thyrsis met
Are at their savory dinner set

Of Hearbs , and other Country Messes
Which the neat-handed Phillis dresses

And then in haste her Bowre she leaves
With Thestylis to bind the Sheaves

Or if the earlier season lead
To the tann 'd Haycock in the Mead

Som times with secure delight
The up-land Hamlets will invite

When the merry Bells ring round
And the jocond rebecks sound

To many a youth , and many a maid
Dancing in the Chequer 'd shade

And young and old com forth to play
On a Sunshine Holyday

Till the live-long day-light fail
Then to the Spicy Nut-brown Ale

With stories told of many a feat
How Faery Mab the junkets eat

She was pincht , and pull 'd she sed
And he by Friars Lanthorn led

Tells how the drudging Goblin swet
To ern his Cream-bowle duly set

When in one night , ere glimps of morn
His shadowy Flale hath thresh 'd the Corn

That ten day-labourers could not end
Then lies him down the Lubbar Fend

And stretch 'd out all the Chimney 's length
Basks at the fire his hairy strength

And Crop-full out of dores he flings
Ere the first Cock his Mattin rings

Thus don the Tales , to bed they creep
By whispering Windes soon lull 'd asleep

Towred Cities please us then
And the busie humm of men

Where throngs of Knights and Barons bold
In weeds of Peace high triumphs hold

With store of Ladies , whose bright eies
Rain influence , and judge the prise

Of Wit , or Arms , while both contend
To win her Grace , whom all commend

There let Hymen oft appear
In Saffron robe , with Taper clear

And pomp , and feast , and revelry
With mask , and antique Pageantry

Such sights as youthfull Poets dream
On Summer eeves by haunted stream

Then to the well-trod stage anon
If Jonsons learned Sock be on

Or sweetest Shakespear fancies childe
Warble his native Wood-notes wilde

And ever against eating Cares
Lap me in soft Lydian Aires

Married to immortal verse
Such as the meeting soul may pierce

In notes , with many a winding bout
Of lincked sweetnes long drawn out

With wanton heed , and giddy cunning
The melting voice through mazes running

Untwisting all the chains that ty
The hidden soul of harmony

That Orpheus self may heave his head
From golden slumber on a bed

Of heapt Elysian flowres , and hear
Such streins as would have won the ear

Of Pluto , to have quite set free
His half regain 'd Eurydice

These delights , if thou canst give
Mirth with thee , I mean to live

And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess
As thick and numberless

As the gay motes that people the Sun Beams
Or likest hovering dreams

But hail thou Goddess , sage and holy
Hail divinest Melancholy

Whose Saintly visage is too bright
To hit the Sense of human sight

And therefore to our weaker view
Ore laid with black staid Wisdoms hue

Black , but such as in esteem
Prince Memnons sister might beseem

Or that Starr 'd Ethiope Queen that strove
To set her beauties praise above

The Sea Nymphs , and their powers offended
Yet thou art higher far descended

Thee bright-hair 'd Vesta long of yore
To solitary Saturn bore

His daughter she ( in Saturns raign
Such mixture was not held a stain

Oft in glimmering Bowres , and glades
He met her , and in secret shades

Of woody Ida 's inmost grove
While yet there was no fear of Jove

Com pensive Nun , devout and pure
Sober , stedfast , and demure

All in a robe of darkest grain
Flowing with majestick train

And sable stole of Cipres Lawn
Over thy decent shoulders drawn

Com , but keep thy wonted state
With eev'n step , and musing gate

And looks commercing with the skies
Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes

There held in holy passion still
Forget thy self to Marble , till

With a sad Leaden downward cast
Thou fix them on the earth as fast

And joyn with thee calm Peace , and Quiet
Spare Fast , that oft with gods doth diet

And hears the Muses in a ring
Ay round about Joves Altar sing

And adde to these retired Leasure
That in trim Gardens takes his pleasure

But first , and chiefest , with thee bring
Him that yon soars on golden wing

Guiding the fiery-wheeled throne
The Cherub Contemplation

And the mute Silence hist along
'Less Philomel will daign a Song

In her sweetest , saddest plight
Smoothing the rugged brow of night

While Cynthia checks her Dragon yoke
Gently o 're th'accustom 'd Oke

Sweet Bird that shunn'st the noise of folly
Most musical ! , most melancholy

Thee Chauntress oft the Woods among
I woo to hear thy eeven-Song

And missing thee , I walk unseen
On the dry smooth-shaven Green

To behold the wandring Moon
Riding neer her highest noon

Like one that had bin led astray
Through the Heav'ns wide pathles way

And oft , as if her head she bowed
Stooping through a fleecy cloud

Oft on a Plat of rising ground
I hear the far-off Curfeu sound

Over som wide-water 'd shoar
Swinging slow with sullen roar

Or if the Ayr will not permit
Som still removed place will fit

Where glowing Embers through the room
Teach light to counterfeit a gloom

Far from all resort of mirth
Save the Cricket on the hearth

Or the Belmans drowsie charm
To bless the dores from nightly harm

Or let my Lamp at midnight hour
Be seen in som high lonely Towr

Where I may oft out-watch the Bear
With thrice great Hermes , or unsphear

The spirit of Plato to unfold
What Worlds , or what vast Regions hold

The immortal mind that hath forsook
Her mansion in this fleshly nook

And of those Daemons that are found
In fire , air , flood , or under ground

Whose power hath a true consent
With planet or with Element

Som time let Gorgeous Tragedy
In Scepter 'd Pall com sweeping by

Presenting Thebs , or Pelops line
Or the tale of Troy divine

Or what ( though rare ) of later age
Ennobled hath the Buskind stage

But , O sad Virgin , that thy power
Might raise Musaeus from his bower

Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing
Such notes as warbled to the string

Drew Iron tears down Pluto 's cheek
And made Hell grant what Love did seek

Or call up him that left half told
The story of Cambuscan bold

Of Camball , and of Algarsife
And who had Canace to wife

That own 'd the vertuous Ring and Glass
And of the wondrous Hors of Brass

On which the Tartar King did ride
And if ought els , great Bards beside

In sage and solemn tunes have sung
Of Turneys and of Trophies hung

Of Forests , and inchantments drear
Where more is meant then meets the ear

Thus night oft see me in thy pale career
Till civil-suited Morn appeer

Not trickt and frounc't as she was wont
With the Attick Boy to hunt

But Cherchef't in a comly Cloud
While rocking Winds are Piping loud

Or usher 'd with a shower still
When the gust hath blown his fill

Ending on the russling Leaves
With minute drops from off the Eaves

And when the Sun begins to fling
His flaring beams , me Goddes bring

To arched walks of twilight groves
And shadows brown that Sylvan loves

Of Pine , or monumental Oake
Where the rude Ax with heaved stroke

Was never heard the Nymphs to daunt
Or fright them from their hallow 'd haunt

There in close covert by som Brook
Where no profaner eye may look

Hide me from Day 's garish eie
While the Bee with Honied thie

That at her flowry work doth sing
And the Waters murmuring

With such consort as they keep
Entice the dewy-feather 'd Sleep

And let som strange mysterious dream
Wave at his Wings in Airy stream

Of lively portrature displayed
Softly on my eye-lids laid

And as I wake , sweet musick breath
Above , about , or underneath

Sent by som spirit to mortals good
Or th'unseen Genius of the Wood

But let my due feet never fail
To walk the studious Cloysters pale

And love the high embowed Roof
With antick Pillars massy proof

And storied Windows richly dight
Casting a dimm religious light

There let the pealing Organ blow
To the full voic 'd Quire below

In Service high , and Anthems cleer
As may with sweetnes , through mine ear

Dissolve me into extasies
And bring all Heav'n before mine eyes

And may at last my weary age
Find out the peacefull hermitage

The Hairy Gown and Mossy Cell
Where I may sit and rightly spell

Of every Star that Heav'n doth shew
And every Herb that sips the dew

Till old experience do attain
To somthing like prophetic strain

These pleasures Melancholy give
And I with thee will choose to live

GEN. Stay gentle Swains , for though in this disguise
I see bright honour sparkle through your eyes

Of famous Arcady ye are , and sprung
Of that renowned flood , so often sung

Divine Alpheus , who by secret sluse
Stole under Seas to meet his Arethuse

And ye the breathing Roses of the Wood
Fair silver-buskind Nymphs as great and good

I know this quest of yours , and free intent
Was all in honour and devotion ment

To the great Mistres of yon princely shrine
Whom with low reverence I adore as mine

And with all helpful service will comply
To further this nights glad solemnity

And lead ye where ye may more neer behold
What shallow-searching Fame hath left untold

Which I full oft amidst these shades alone
Have sate to wonder at , and gaze upon

For know by lot from Jove I am the powr
Of this fair wood , and live in Oak'n bowr

To nurse the Saplings tall , and curl the grove
With Ringlets quaint , and wanton windings wove

And all my Plants I save from nightly ill
Of noisom winds , and blasting vapours chill

And from the Boughs brush off the evil dew
And heal the harms of thwarting thunder blew

Or what the cross dire-looking Planet smites
Or hurtfull Worm with canker 'd venom bites

When Eev'ning gray doth rise , I fetch my round
Over the mount , and all this hallow 'd ground

And early ere the odorous breath of morn
Awakes the slumbring leaves , or tasseld horn

Shakes the high thicket , haste I all about
Number my ranks , and visit every sprout

With puissant words , and murmurs made to bless
But els in deep of night when drowsines

Hath lockt up mortal sense , then listen I
To the celestial Sirens harmony

That sit upon the nine enfolded Sphears
And sing to those that hold the vital shears

And turn the Adamantine spindle round
On which the fate of gods and men is wound

Such sweet compulsion doth in musick ly
To lull the daughters of Necessity

And keep unsteddy Nature to her law
And the low world in measur 'd motion draw

After the heavenly tune , which none can hear
Of human mould with grosse unpurged ear

And yet such musick worthiest were to blaze
The peerles height of her immortal praise

Whose lustre leads us , and for her most fit
If my inferior hand or voice could hit

Inimitable sounds , yet as we go
What ere the skill of lesser gods can show

I will assay , her worth to celebrate
And so attend ye toward her glittering state

Where ye may all that are of noble stemm
Approach , and kiss her sacred vestures hemm

O 're the smooth enameld green
Where no print of step hath been

Follow me as I sing
And touch the warbled string

Under the shady roof
Of branching Elm Star-proof

Follow me
I will bring you where she sits

Clad in splendor as befits
Her deity

Such a rural Queen
All Arcadia hath not seen

Nymphs and Shepherds dance no more
By sandy Ladons Lillied banks

On old Lycaeus or Cyllene hoar
Trip no more in twilight ranks

Though Erynanth your loss deplore
A better soyl shall give ye thanks

> From the stony Maenalus
Bring your Flocks , and live with us

Here ye shall have greater grace
To serve the Lady of this place

Though Syrinx your Pans Mistres were
Yet Syrinx well might wait on her

Such a rural Queen
All Arcadia hath not seen

Listen and appear to us
In name of great Oceanus

By the earth-shaking Neptune 's mace
And Tethys grave majestick pace

By hoary Nereus wrincled look
And the Carpathian wisards hook

By scaly Tritons winding shell
And old sooth-saying Glaucus spell

By Leucothea 's lovely hands
And her son that rules the strands

By Thetis tinsel-slipper 'd feet
And the Songs of Sirens sweet

By dead Parthenope 's dear tomb
And fair Ligea 's golden comb

Wherwith she sits on diamond rocks
Sleeking her soft alluring locks

By all the Nymphs that nightly dance
Upon thy streams with wily glance

Rise , rise , and heave thy rosie head
> From thy coral-pav'n bed

And bridle in thy headlong wave
Till thou our summons answered have

Sab : By the rushy-fringed bank
Where grows the Willow and the Osier dank

Thick set with Agat , and the azurn sheen
Of Turkis blew , and Emrauld green

Whilst from off the waters fleet
Thus I set my printless feet

O 're the Cowslips Velvet head
That bends not as I tread

Com Lady while Heaven lends us grace
Let us fly this cursed place

Lest the Sorcerer us intice
With som other new device

Not a waste , or needless sound
Till we com to holier ground

I shall be your faithfull guide
Through this gloomy covert wide

And not many furlongs thence
Is your Fathers residence

Where this night are met in state
Many a friend to gratulate

His wish't presence , and beside
All the Swains that there abide

With Jiggs , and rural dance resort
We shall catch them at their sport

And our sudden coming there
Will double all their mirth and chere

Com let us haste , the Stars grow high
But night sits monarch yet in the mid sky

Spir : Back Shepherds , back , anough your play
Till next Sun-shine holiday

Here be without duck or nod
Other trippings to be trod

Of lighter toes , and such Court guise
As Mercury did first devise

With the mincing Dryades
On the Lawns , and on the Leas

Noble Lord , and Lady bright
I have brought ye new delight

Here behold so goodly grown
Three fair branches of your own

Heav'n hath timely tri 'd their youth
Their faith , their patience , and their truth

And sent them here through hard assays
With a crown of deathless Praise

To triumph in victorious dance
O 're sensual folly , and Intemperance

Spir : To the Ocean now I fly
And those happy climes that ly

Where day never shuts his eye
Up in the broad fields of the sky

There I suck the liquid ayr
All amidst the Gardens fair

Of Hesperus , and his daughters three
That sing about the golden tree

Iris there with humid bow
Waters the odorous banks that blow

Flowers of more mingled hew
Then her purfl 'd scarf can shew

And drenches with Elysian dew
( List mortals , if your ears be true

Beds of Hyacinth , and roses
Where young Adonis oft reposes

Waxing well of his deep wound
In slumber soft , and on the ground

Sadly sits th ' Assyrian Queen
But far above in spangled sheen

Celestial Cupid her fam 'd son advanc't
Holds his dear Psyche sweet intranc't

After her wandring labours long
Till free consent the gods among

Make her his eternal Bride
And from her fair unspotted side

Two blissful twins are to be born
Youth and Joy ; so Jove hath sworn

But now my task is smoothly don
I can fly , or I can run

Quickly to the green earths end
Where the bow 'd welkin slow doth bend

And from thence can soar as soon
To the corners of the Moon

Mortals that would follow me
Love vertue , she alone is free

She can teach ye how to clime
Higher then the Spheary chime

Or if Vertue feeble were
Heav'n it self would stoop to her

HAIL native Language , that by sinews weak
Didst move my first endeavouring tongue to speak

And mad'st imperfect words with childish tripps
Half unpronounc't , slide through my infant-lipps

Driving dum silence from the portal dore
Where he had mutely sate two years before

Here I salute thee and thy pardon ask
That now I use thee in my latter task

Small loss it is that thence can come unto thee
I know my tongue but little Grace can do thee

Thou needst not be ambitious to be first
Believe me I have thither packt the worst

And , if it happen as I did forecast
The daintest dishes shall be serv 'd up last

I pray thee then deny me not thy aide
For this same small neglect that I have made

But haste thee strait to do me once a Pleasure
And from thy wardrope bring thy chiefest treasure

Not those new fangled toys , and triming slight
Which takes our late fantasticks with delight

But cull those richest Robes , and gay'st attire
Which deepest Spirits , and choicest Wits desire

I have some naked thoughts that rove about
And loudly knock to have their passage out

And wearie of their place do only stay
Till thou hast deck't them in thy best aray

That so they may without suspect or fears
Fly swiftly to this fair Assembly 's ears

Yet I had rather if I were to chuse
Thy service in some graver subject use

Such as may make thee search thy coffers round
Before thou cloath my fancy in fit sound

Such where the deep transported mind may scare
Above the wheeling poles , and at Heav'ns dore

Look in , and see each blissful Deitie
How he before the thunderous throne doth lie

Listening to what unshorn Apollo sings
To th'touch of golden wires , while Hebe brings

Immortal Nectar to her Kingly Sire
Then passing through the Spherse of watchful fire

And mistie Regions of wide air next under
And hills of Snow and lofts of piled Thunder

May tell at length how green-ey 'd Neptune raves
In Heav'ns defiance mustering all his waves

Then sing of secret things that came to pass
When Beldam Nature in her cradle was

And last of Kings and Queens and Hero 's old
Such as the wise Demodocus once told

In solemn Songs at King Alcinous feast
While sad Ulisses soul and all the rest

Are held with his melodious harmonie
In willing chains and sweet captivitie

But fie my wandring Muse how thou dost stray
Expectance calls thee now another way

Thou know'st it must he now thy only bent
To keep in compass of thy Predicament

Then quick about thy purpos 'd business come
That to the next I may resign my Roome

Good luck befriend thee Son ; for at thy birth
The Faiery Ladies daunc't upon the hearth

Thy drowsie Nurse hath sworn she did them spie
Come tripping to the Room where thou didst lie

And sweetly singing round about thy Bed
Strew all their blessings on thy sleeping Head

She heard them give thee this , that thou should'st still
From eyes of mortals walk invisible

Yet there is something that doth force my fear
For once it was my dismal hap to hear

A Sybil old , bow-bent with crooked age
That far events full wisely could presage

And in Times long and dark Prospective Glass
Fore-saw what future dayes should bring to pass

Your Son , said she , ( nor can you it prevent
Shall subject be to many an Accident

O 're all his Brethren he shall Reign as King
Yet every one shall make him underling

And those that can not live from him asunder
Ungratefully shall strive to keep him under

In worth and excellence he shall out-go them
Yet being above them , he shall be below them

From others he shall stand in need of nothing
Yet on his Brothers shall depend for Cloathing

To find a Foe it shall not be his hap
And peace shall lull him in her flowry lap

Yet shall he live in strife , and at his dore
Devouring war shall never cease to roare

Yea it shall be his natural property
To harbour those that are at enmity

What power , what force , what mighty spell , if not
Your learned hands , can loose this Gordian knot

Rivers arise ; whether thou be the Son
Of utmost Tweed , or Oose , or gulphie Dun

Or Trent , who like some earth-born Giant spreads
His thirty Armes along the indented Meads

Or sullen Mole that runneth underneath
Or Severn swift , guilty of Maidens death

Or Rockie Avon , or of Sedgie Lee
Or Coaly Tine , or antient hallowed Dee

Or Humber loud that keeps the Scythians Name
Or Medway smooth , or Royal Towred Thame

BLESS 'D is the man who hath not walk 'd astray
In counsel of the wicked , and ith'way

Of sinners hath not stood , and in the seat
Of scorners hath not sate . But in the great

Jehovahs Law is ever his delight
And in his law he studies day and night

He shall be as a tree which planted grows
By watry streams , and in his season knows

To yield his fruit , and his leaf shall not fall
And what he takes in hand shall prosper all

Not so the wicked , but as chaff which fanned
The wind drives , so the wicked shall not stand

In judgment , or abide their tryal then
Nor sinners in th'assembly of just men

For the Lord knows th'upright way of the just
And the way of bad men to ruine must

WHEN I beheld the Poet blind , yet bold
In slender Book his vast Design unfold

Messiah Crown 'd , Gods Reconcil 'd Decree
Rebelling Angels , the Forbidden Tree

Heav'n , Hell , Earth , Chaos , All ; the Argument
Held me a while misdoubting his Intent

That he would ruine ( for I saw him strong
The sacred Truths to Fable and old Song

( So Sampson groap 'd the Temples Posts in spight
The World o'rewhelming to revenge his sight

Yet as I read soon growing less severe
I lik 'd his Project , the success did fear

Through that wide Field how he his way should find
O 're which lame Faith leads Understanding blind

Lest he perplex 'd the things he would explain
And what was easie he should render vain

Or if a Work so infinite he spanned
Jealous I was that some less skilful hand

( Such as disquiet always what is well
And by ill imitating would excell

Might hence presume the whole Creations day
To change in Scenes . and show it in a Play

Pardon me , Mighty Poet , nor despise
My causeless , yet not impious , surmise

But I am now convinc 'd , and none will dare
Within thy Labours to pretend a share

Thou hast not miss 'd one thought that could be fit
And all that was improper dost omit

So that no room is here for Writers left
But to detect their Ignorance or Theft

That Majesty which through thy Work doth Reign
Draws the Devout , deterring the Profane

And things divine thou treatst of in such state
As them preserves , and thee , inviolate

At once delight and horrour on us seise
Thou singst with so much gravity and ease

And above humane flight dost soar aloft
With Plume so strong , so equal , and so soft

The Bird nam 'd from that Paradise you sing
So never flaggs , but always keeps on Wing

Where couldst thou words of such a compass find
Whence furnish such a vast expence of mind

Just Heav'n thee like Tiresias to requite
Rewards with Prophesie thy loss of sight

Well mightst thou scorn thy Readers to allure
With tinkling Rhime , of thy own sense secure

While the Town-Bayes writes all the while and spells
And like a Pack-horse tires without his Bells

Their Fancies like our Bushy-points appear
The Poets tag them , we for fashion wear

I too transported by the Mode offend
And while I meant to Praise thee must Commend

Thy Verse created like thy Theme sublime
In Number , Weight , and Measure , needs not Rhime

& meerly mortall drosse
so little is our losse

for when as each thing bad thou hast entombed
& last of all thy greedie selfe consumed

then long Aeternity shall greet our blisse
wth an individuall kisse

and Joy shall overtake us as a flood
when every thing yt is sincerely good

& pfectly divine
with Truth , & Peace , & Love shall ever shine

about the supreme throne
of him t ' whose happy-making sight alone

when once our heav'nly-guided soule shall clime
then all this earthie grossnesse quit

attir 'd wth starres wee shall for ever sit
Triumphing over Death , & Chance , & thee O Time

Warbl'st at eeve , when all the Woods are still
Thou with fresh hope the Lovers heart dost fill

While the jolly hours lead on propitious May
Thy liquid notes that close the eye of Day

First heard before the shallow Cuccoo 's bill
Portend success in love ; O if Jove 's will

Wise men alway
Affirm and say

Diligently
For to apply

And in no wise
To enterprise

For he that will
And can no skill

He that hath left
The hosier 's craft

The smith that shall
To painting fall

A black draper
With white paper

An old butler
Become a cutler

And an old trot
That can God wot

With her physic
Will keep one sick

A man of law
That never saw

Weening to rise
By merchandise

A merchant eke
That will go seek

To fall in suit
Till he dispute

Pleading the law
For every straw

With 'bate and strife
But by my life

When an hatter
Will go smatter

Or a pedlar
Were a meddler

All that ensue
Such craftes new

That evermore
They do therefore

This thing was tried
And verified

That thriftly was
Or he could pass

While that he would
See how he could

Now if you will
Know how it fell

It happed so
Not long ago

An hundred pound
Of nobles round

His son he would
Should have this gold

But to suffice
This child , well thrice

Yet ere this day
I have heard say

Hath with good cast
Be rich at last

But this young man
So well began

That certainly
His policy

For lest some blast
Might overcast

Men with some wile
Might him beguile

For to put out
All manner doubt

For ev'ry whit
By his own wit

First fair and well
Thereof much deal

But then he thought
That way was nought

So was he fain
From thence again

And by and by
Covetously

In his own breast
He thought it best

Then wist he well
Whatever fell

He borrow 'd then
Of other men

Never paid it
Up he laid it

Yet on the gear
That he would wear

So it were nice
As for the price

With lusty sport
And with resort

In mirth and play
Full many a day

And men had sworn
Some man is born

And so was he
For such degree

That without doubt
When he went out

Was ready strait
On him to wait

But he doubtless
Of his meekness

And would not go
Companied so

To Saint Cath'rine
Strait as a line

For devotion
Or promotion

There spent he fast
Till all was past

To ask their debt
But none could get

With visage stout
He bare it out

A month or twain
Till he was fain

Then was he there
In greater fear

And would as fain
Depart again

Then after this
To a friend of his

Whereas he lay
So sick alway

It happed than
A merchant man

Of an officer
Then 'gan enquire

And he ans'red
`` Be not afraid

I you behest
I shall him 'rest

I fear quoth he
It will not be

The sergeant said
`` Be not afraid

In many a game
Like to the same

And for your sake
Let me be bake

Thus part they both
And forth then go'th

And for a day
All his array

So was he dight
That no man might

He dopp 'd and dooked
He spake and looked

Yet in a glass
Ere he would pass

His heart for pride
Leapt in his side

Then forth apace
Unto the place

To do this deed
But now take heed

He drew him nigh
And softily

And a damsel
That heard him well

The friar said
God speed fair maid

It is told me
Well Sir , quoth she

Quoth he , mistress
No harm doubtless

To hurt no man
But as we can

With him truly
Fain speak would I

He is so sick
Ye be not like

Quoth he , fair mai
Yet I you pray

Vouchsafe to do
As go him to

Would with him speak
And matters break

Quoth she , I will
Stand you here still

Up did she go
And told him so

He mistrusting
No manner thing

And fetch him hither
That we together

Up she him brought
No harm she thought

This officer
This feigned frere

He dopped than
And greet this man

And he again
Right glad and fain

The friar then said
You be dismayed

Indeed , quoth he
It hath with me

Sir , quoth the frere
Be of good cheer

For Christ his sake
Look that you take

God may turn all
And so he shall

But I would now
Commune with you

Or elles not
Of matters that

Down went the maid
The merchant said

Of this tiding
That you me bring

When there was none
But they alone

Said , I 'rest thee
Come on with me

Thou shalt obey
Come on thy way

Thou go'st not hence
For all the pence

This merchant there
For wrath and fear

Said , whoreson thief
With a mischief

And with his fist
Upon the list

That backward down
Almost in swoon

Yet was this man
Well fearder than

Till with good raps
And heavy claps

The friar took heart
And up he start

And so there go'th
Between them both

They rent and tear
Each others hair

Till with lugging
And with tugging

Then on the ground
Together round

They roll and rumble
They turn and tumble

So long above
They heave and shove

The maid and wife
To break the strife

And when they spy
The captain 's lie

The friar 's hood
They pull 'd agood

While he was blind
The wench behind

Many a joll
About the noul

The wife came yet
And with her feet

And with her rock
Many a knock

They laid his mace
About his face

The friar frap
Gat many a swap

Up they him lift
And with ill thrift

Down they him threw
And said adieu

The friar arose
But I suppose

He shook his ears
And from great fears

Quoth he , now lost
Is all this cost

Ill must he theeh
That caused me

Now masters all
Here now I shall

In anywise
I would advise

His own craft use
All new refuse

Play not the frere
Now make good cheer

Remember death and look here upon me
Ensaumple I think there may no better be

Yourself wotte well that in this realm was I
Your queen but late , and lo now here I lie

Had I not plenty of every pleasant thing
Merciful god this is a strange reckoning

Riches , honor , wealth , and ancestry
Hath me forsaken and lo now here I lie

But O good God what vaileth all this gere
When death is come thy mighty messenger

Obey we must there is no remedy
Me hath he summoned , and lo now here I lie

O false astrology devynatrice
Of goddes secrets making thyself so wise

How true for this year thy prophecy
The year yet lasteth , and lo now here I lie

In sundry wise , and reckon there again
The joy that I have had , and I dare sayne

For all my honor , endured yet have I
More woe than wealth , and lo now here I lie

Mine own dear lord now shall I never see
Almighty god vouchsafe to grant that ye

For you and your children well may edify
My palace builded is , for lo now here I lie

Into your hands here I clean resign
To be bestowed upon your children and mine

Erst were you father , and now must ye supply
The mothers part also , for lo now here I lie

Now am I gone , and have left you behind
O mortal folk that we be very blind

That we least fear , full oft it is most nye
From you depart I first , and lo now here I lie

Farewell my daughter Katherine late the fere
To prince Arthur mine own child so dear

It booteth not for me to weep and cry
Pray for my soul , for now lo here I lie

God make you virtuous wise and fortunate
Adieu sweet heart my little daughter Kate

Thou shalt sweet babe such is thy destiny
Thy mother never know , for lo now here I lie

Lo here the end of worldly vanity
Now well are ye that earthly folly flee

And heavenly things love and magnify
Farewell and pray for me , for lo now here I lie

See in this world wherefore to the alone
Immortal god verily three and one

I me commend thy infinite mercy
Show to thy servant , for lo now here I lie

Joy , rest , and peace , and all thyng finally
That any pleasure or profit may come by

To mannes comfort , ayde , and sustinaunce
Is all at my devyse and ordinaunce

And many a purpose , bounden sure and fast
With wise provision , I have overcast

Without good happe there may no wit suffise
Better is to be fortunate than wyse

But for me list not frendly on them loke
Thus lyke the fox they fare that once forsoke

The pleasaunt grapes , and gan for to defy them
Because he lept and yet could not come by them

The nedy wretch that lingereth in distresse
Without myne helpe is ever comfortlesse

But would to God these hateful bookes all
Were in a fire burnt to powder small

Then might I lead my life always in play
Which life God send me to mine ending day

And to bestride a good and lusty steedÃ¢â‚¬ â€
These things become a very man indeed

Yet thinketh this boy his peevish game sweeter
But what , no force , his reason is no better

By us subdued for all thy great pride
My fiery dart pierceth thy tender side

Now thou who erst dispisedst children small
Shall wax a child again and be my thrall

I help to rule , to my labour and smart
Therefore Cupid withdraw thy fiery dart

Chargeable matters shall of love oppress
Thy childish game and idle business

Therefore sage father , greatly magnified
Descend from your chair , set apart your pride

Vouchsafe to lend , tho ' it be to your pain
To me , a fool , some of your wise brain

O cruel Death , thy power I confound
When thou a noble man hast brought to ground

Maugre thy teeth , to live cause him shall I
Of people in perpetual memory

O simple Fame , how darest thou man honour
Promising of his name an endless flower

Who may in the world have a name eternal
When I shall in process destroy the world and all

Art nothing else but the mobility
Of sun and moon , changing in every degree

When they shall leave their course , thou shalt be brought
For all thy pride and boasting , into nought

During my life thou shalt not me beguile
Trust shall I God to enter in erewhile

His haven of havens sure and uniform : Ã¢â‚¬ â€
After a calm I still expect the storm . *

And in my mind remember this and that
Ye may not blame me , though I shrew your cat

In faith I bless you , and a thousand times
For lending me some leisure to make rhymes

The flood that is in many channels take
In each of them shall feeble streams make

The love that is divided among many
Uneath sufficeth that any part have any

So will He in love no parting fellows have
Love Him therefore with all that He thee gave

For body , soul , wit , cunning , mind and thought
Part will He none , but either all or naught

He judgeth him in perfect joy and bliss
And whoso of that company doth miss

Live he in never so prosperous estate
He thinketh him wretched and infortunate

Yet till the time that he may once resort
Unto that blessed , joyful , heavenly port

Where he of God may have the glorious sight
Is void of perfect joy and sure delight

But all well fashioned , proper , goodly , clean
That in his person , there be nothing seen

In speech , apparel , gesture , look or pace
That may offend or diminish any grace

As it is possible for thee to devise
I mean not hereby that thou shouldest arise

And in the glass upon thy body prowl
But with fair virtue to adorn thy soul

All to endure and think it also too small
Though it were death , so he might therewithal

The joyful presence of that person get
On whom he hath his heart and love set

And glad to die , so that he may be sure
By his departing hence for to procure

After this valley dark , the heavenly light
And of his love the glorious blessed sight

Loss , adversity , trouble , grief , or pain
And of his sorrow joyful is and fain

And happy thinketh himself that he may take
Some misadventure for his lover 's sake

For Whom if thou be never so woe bestead
Yet thou ne shalt sustain ( be not adread

Half the dolour , grief and adversity
That He already suffered hath for thee

May not as he would , he will yet as he may
Ever be with his love , that is to say

Where his heavy body will not be brought
He will be conversant in mind and thought

Be present with God and conversant always
For certes , whoso list , he may purvey

Though all the world would him therefrom bereaven
To bear his body in earth , his mind in heaven

Nor none so small a trifle or conceit
Lace , girdle , point , or proper glove strait

But that if to his love it has been near
The lover hath it precious , lief and dear

Have it in love , honor and reverence
And specially give them pre-eminence

Which daily done His blessed body wurche
The quick relics , the ministers of His Church

And everything that may the fame clear
Of his love : he may in no manner

Endure to hear that therefrom mighten vary
Or anything sound into the contrary

Whom hell , earth , and all the heaven obeys
Whose perfect lover ought by no manner ways

To suffer the cursed words of blasphemy
Or anything spoken of God unreverently

But honorable , worthy and excellent
And also surmounting far in his intent

All other that he hath known by sight or name
And would that every man should think the same

That all the creatures in this world wrought
In comparison should he set at nought

And glad be if he might the mean devise
That all the world would thinken in likewise

He mindeth not what men about him talk
But eat he , drink he , sit , lie down or walk

He burneth ever as it were with a fire
In the fervent heat of his desire

While others play , revel , sing , and dance
None earthly joy , disport , or vain plesance

Should him delight , or anything remove
His ardent mind from God , his heavenly love

And whether his love be with him , or elsewhere
Oft from his eyes there falleth many a tear

For very joy , when they together be
When they be sundered , for adversity

With inward gladness of pleasant contemplation
Out break the tears for joy and delectation

And when his love list eft to part him fro
Out break the tears again for pain and woe

That person in whom he set hath his delight
Diligently to serve both day and night

For very love , without any regard
To any profit , guerdon or reward

Not for His service any wise dissever
Freely look also that thou serve thereto , never

Trust of reward or profit do thee bind
But only faithful heart and loving mind

Be very good and very , amiable
Thirdly , of reason be we serviceable

Without the gaping after any more
To such as have done much for us before

Who is so good , so lovely also as He
Who hath already done so much for thee

As He that first thee made , and on the rood
Eft thee redeemÃƒÂ¨d with His precious blood

Which heaven and earth directest all alone
We Thee beseech , good Lord , with woeful moan

Spare us wretches and wash away our guilt
That we be not by Thy just anger spilt

The whole engine of all this world , I say
The engine that enduren shall for aye

With such examination might not stand
Space of a moment in Thine angry hand

With piteous mercy tempering justice
For as thou dost reward us device

About our merit / so dost thou dispense
Thy punishment far under our offence

Howbeit worthy enough are they pardee
Be they never so unworthy , whom that he

Chooses to accept , which where so ever he taketh
Whom he unworthy findeth , worthy maketh

Our sin forgot and our malignity
With piteous yes of thy benignity

Friendly look on us once , thine own we be
Servants or sinners whether it liketh thee

Thy gifts noble , wonderful , and kind
Thou shalt us then the same persons find

Which are to thee and have be long space
Servants by nature , children by thy grace

Sin hath us guilty made this many a year
But let thy grace , thy grace that hath no peer

Of our offence surmount all the preace
That in our sin thine honor may increase

All with one voice declare and testify
Thy goodness : yet thy singular mercy

Thy piteous heart thy gracious indulgence
No thing so clearly showeth as our offence

And crucify god , that we poor wretches we
Should from our filthy sin cleansed be

With blood and water of thine own side
That streamed from thy blessed wounds wide

O goodness serving thy servants in distress
O love , O pity , well nigh now thankless

O goodness mighty gracious and wise
And yet almost now vanquished with our vice

With whom me rueth so long to have be thrall
Grant me good Lord and creator of all

The flame to quench of all sinful desire
And in thy love set all mine heart afire

Alone into his lordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high presence
He may thee find : O well of indulgence

In thy lordship not as a lord : but rather
As a very tender loving father

Enforce themselves to make us bond and thrall
Let him remember that choose what may he shall

Even after the world , yet must he need sustain
Sorrow , adversity , labor , grief , and pain

In which the end of labor , labor is
And when the world hath left us after this

Void of all virtue : the reward when we die
Is nought but fire and pain perpetually

Ascended never but by manly fight
And bitter passion ; then were it no right

That any servant , ye will yourself record
Should stand in better condition than his lord

How that thereby redound unto us might
Any profit , but only for delightÃ¢â‚¬ â€

To be conformed and like in some behavior
To Jesu Christ our blessed Lord and Savoir

Cast in thy mind as oft with good devotion
How thou resemblest Christ : as with sour potion

If thou pain thy taste : remember therewithal
How Christ for thee tasted eysell and gall

If thou be tempt with pride : think how that when
He was in form of God , yet of a bondman

He took the shape and humbled Himself for thee
To the most odious and vile death of a tree

And as a thief between two thieves thrests
With all rebuke and shame : yet from his breast

Came never sign of wrath or of disdain
But patiently endured all the pain

But to some virtue thou mayst it apply
For oft thou shalt , resisting valiantly

The fiendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s might and subtle fiery dart
Our Savior Christ resemble in some part

But only in the virtue of our Savior
For He it is by Whose mighty power

The world was vanquished and its prince cast out
Which reigned before in all the earth about

To Him be all honor and lowly reverence
Oft should we require with all our diligence

With prayer , with tears , and lamentable plaints
The aid of His grace and His holy saints

Runneth about seeking whom he may devour
Wherefore continually upon thy tower

Lest he thee unpurveyed and unready catch
Thou must with the prophet stand and keep watch

To vanquish him and put him unto flight
And that is when of the same deed , thought or sight

By which he would have thee with sin contract
Thou takest occasion of some good virtuous act

But let humility be thy sure guide
Thy good work to God let it be applied

Think it not thine but a gift of His
Of Whose grace undoubtedly all goodness is

For God of His goodness and liberal mercy
May grant the gift , and also thy proud enemy

Confounded and rebuked by thy battle
Shall thee no more haply for very shame assail

For if thou be ready , the devil will thee fear
Wherefore in any wise so even thou thee bear

That thou remember and have ever in memory
In victory battle , in battle victory

And great adventurers often curse the dice
Jeopard not too far therefore and ye be wise

But evermore eschew the occasions of sin
For he that loveth peril shall perish therein

Beat out their brains therefore at the stone
Perilous is the canker that catcheth the bone

Too late cometh the medicine if thou let the sore
By long continuance increase more and more

Over the devil to be a conqueror
Than is in the use of thy beastly pleasure

Of virtue more joy the conscience hath within
Than outward the body of all his filthy sin

But like rude beasts unadvisedly
Lacking discretion they compare and apply

Of their foul sin the voluptuous delight
To the laborious travail of the conflict and fight

Should once at the leastwise do his diligence
To prove and essay with manly defense

What pleasure there is , what honor , peace and rest
In glorious victory , triumph and conquest

Lest such revelation should his heart extol
His flesh was suffered to rebel against his soul

This did almighty God of His goodness provide
To preserve His servant from the danger of pride

Yet stood in peril lest pride might him depose
Well ought we then our hearts fence and close

Against vainglory , the mother of reprief
The very crop and root of all mischief

And peradventure death within one hour
Shall us bereave wealth , riches and honor

And bring us down full low both small and great
To vile carrion and wretched worms meat

Or finally , in whatsoever delight
Occupied is thy wretched appetite

Thou shalt it find , when thou hast all cast
Little , simple , short and suddenly past

The pleasure which thine evil work doth contain
Glideth his way , thou must him not restrain

The evil then in thy breast cleaveth behind
With grudge of heart and heaviness of mind

To thy most utter despiteous enemies
O mad merchant , O foolish merchandise

To buy a trifle , O childish reckoning
And pay therefore so dear a precious thing

Since that hour in which it did begin
It holdeth on the course and will not lin

But fast it runneth on and passen shall
As doth a dream or shadow on the wall

For pleasant melody and dainty fare
Death stealeth on full slyly and unaware

He lieth at hand and shall us enterprise
We know not how soon nor in what manner wise

Thy sin to cleanse , and though thou haddest space
Yet peradventure shouldst thou lack the grace

Well ought we then be feared to do offence
Impenitent lest we departen hence

And after thy desert look to what cost
Thou art conveyed at such time as thy ghost

From this wretched carcass shall dissever
Be it joy or pain , endure it shall forever

That He , for an angel , never would endure
Regard , O man , thine excellent nature

Thou that with angels art made to be equal
For very shame be not the devil 's thrall

Take every sport that men can thee devise
And among them all on warrantise

Thou shalt no pleasure comparable find
To th ' inward gladness of a virtuous mind

Yet He thee kept hath and brought thee up to this
And daily calleth upon thee to His bliss

How mayst thou then to Him unloving be
That ever hath been so loving unto thee

Think on His blood beat out at every vein
Think on His precious heart carved in twain

Think how for thy redemption all was wrought
Let Him not lose thee that He so dear hath bought

Shall thee of slothful cowardice accuse
God will thee help if thou do not refuse

If other have stood or , this thou mayst eftsoon
Nothing impossible is that hath been done

What dire offence from amorous causes springs
What mighty contests rise from trivial things

I sing -- This verse to CARYL , Muse ! is due
This , ev'n Belinda may vouchsafe to view

Slight is the subject , but not so the praise
If She inspire , and He approve my lays

Say what strange motive , Goddess ! could compel
A well-bred Lord t ' assault a gentle Belle

O say what stranger cause , yet unexplored
Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord

In tasks so bold , can little men engage
And in soft bosoms dwells such mighty Rage

Sol thro ' white curtains shot a timorous ray
And oped those eyes that must eclipse the day

Now lap-dogs give themselves the rousing shake
And sleepless lovers , just at twelve , awake

Thrice rung the bell , the slipper knock 'd the ground
And the press 'd watch return 'd a silver sound

Belinda still her downy pillow prest
Her guardian SYLPH prolong 'd the balmy rest

'T was He had summon 'd to her silent bed
The morning-dream that hover 'd o'er her head

A Youth more glitt'ring than a Birth-night Beau
( That ev'n in slumber caus 'd her cheek to glow

Seem 'd to her ear his winning lips to lay
And thus in whispers said , or seem 'd to say

Fairest of mortals , thou distinguish 'd care
Of thousand bright Inhabitants of Air

If e'er one vision touch . 'd thy infant thought
Of all the Nurse and all the Priest have taught

Of airy Elves by moonlight shadows seen
The silver token , and the circled green

Or virgins visited by Angel-pow'rs
With golden crowns and wreaths of heav'nly flow'rs

Hear and believe ! thy own importance know
Nor bound thy narrow views to things below

Some secret truths , from learned pride concealed
To Maids alone and Children are revealed

What tho ' no credit doubting Wits may give
The Fair and Innocent shall still believe

Know , then , unnumber 'd Spirits round thee fly
The light Militia of the lower sky

These , tho ' unseen , are ever on the wing
Hang o'er the Box , and hover round the Ring

Think what an equipage thou hast in Air
And view with scorn two Pages and a Chair

As now your own , our beings were of old
And once inclos 'd in Woman 's beauteous mould

Thence , by a soft transition , we repair
From earthly Vehicles to these of air

Think not , when Woman 's transient breath is fled
That all her vanities at once are dead

Succeeding vanities she still regards
And tho ' she plays no more , o'erlooks the cards

Her joy in gilded Chariots , when alive
And love of Ombre , after death survive

For when the Fair in all their pride expire
To their first Elements their Souls retire

The Sprites of fiery Termagants in Flame
Mount up , and take a Salamander 's name

Soft yielding minds to Water glide away
And sip , with Nymphs , their elemental Tea

The graver Prude sinks downward to a Gnome
In search of mischief still on Earth to roam

The light Coquettes in Sylphs aloft repair
And sport and flutter in the fields of Air

`` Know further yet ; whoever fair and chaste
Rejects mankind , is by some Sylph embraced

For Spirits , freed from mortal laws , with ease
Assume what sexes and what shapes they please

What guards the purity of melting Maids
In courtly balls , and midnight masquerades

Safe from the treach'rous friend , the daring spark
The glance by day , the whisper in the dark

When kind occasion prompts their warm desires
When music softens , and when dancing fires

'T is but their Sylph , the wise Celestials know
Tho ' Honour is the word with Men below

Some nymphs there are , too conscious of their face
For life predestin 'd to the Gnomes ' embrace

These swell their prospects and exalt their pride
When offers are disdain 'd , and love denyed

Then gay Ideas crowd the vacant brain
While Peers , and Dukes , and all their sweeping train

And Garters , Stars , and Coronets appear
And in soft sounds , Your Grace salutes their ear

'T is these that early taint the female soul
Instruct the eyes of young Coquettes to roll

Teach Infant-cheeks a bidden blush to know
And little hearts to flutter at a Beau

Oft , when the world imagine women stray
The Sylphs thro ' mystic mazes guide their way

Thro ' all the giddy circle they pursue
And old impertinence expel by new

What tender maid but must a victim fall
To one man 's treat , but for another 's ball

When Florio speaks what virgin could withstand
If gentle Damon did not squeeze her hand

With varying vanities , from ev'ry part
They shift the moving Toyshop of their heart

Where wigs with wigs , with sword-knots sword-knots strive
Beaux banish beaux , and coaches coaches drive

This erring mortals Levity may call
Oh blind to truth ! the Sylphs contrive it all

Of these am I , who thy protection claim
A watchful sprite , and Ariel is my name

Late , as I rang 'd the crystal wilds of air
In the clear Mirror of thy ruling Star

I saw , alas ! some dread event impend
Ere to the main this morning sun descend

But heav'n reveals not what , or how , or where
Warn 'd by the Sylph , oh pious maid , beware

This to disclose is all thy guardian can
Beware of all , but most beware of Man

He said ; when Shock , who thought she slept too long
Leap 'd up , and wak 'd his mistress with his tongue

'T was then , Belinda , if report say true
Thy eyes first open 'd on a Billet-doux

Wounds , Charms , and Ardors were no sooner read
But all the Vision vanish 'd from thy head

And now , unveil 'd , the Toilet stands displayed
Each silver Vase in mystic order laid

First , rob 'd in white , the Nymph intent adores
With head uncover 'd , the Cosmetic pow'rs

A heav'nly image in the glass appears
To that she bends , to that her eyes she rears

Th ' inferior Priestess , at her altar 's side
Trembling begins the sacred rites of Pride

Unnumber 'd treasures ope at once , and here
The various off'rings of the world appear

From each she nicely culls with curious toil
And decks the Goddess with the glitt'ring spoil

This casket India 's glowing gems unlocks
And all Arabia breathes from yonder box

The Tortoise here and Elephant unite
Transformed to combs , the speckled , and the white

Here files of pins extend their shining rows
Puffs , Powders , Patches , Bibles , Billet-doux

Now awful Beauty puts on all its arms
The fair each moment rises in her charms

Repairs her smiles , awakens ev'ry grace
And calls forth all the wonders of her face

Sees by degrees a purer blush arise
And keener lightnings quicken in her eyes

The busy Sylphs surround their darling care
These set the head , and those divide the hair

Some fold the sleeve , whilst others plait the gown
And Betty 's prais 'd for labours not her own

Not with more glories , in th ' etherial plain
The Sun first rises o'er the purpled main

Than , issuing forth , the rival of his beams
Launch 'd on the bosom of the silver Thames

Fair Nymphs , and well-drest Youths around her shone
But ev'ry eye was fix 'd on her alone

On her white breast a sparkling Cross she wore
Which Jews might kiss , and Infidels adore

Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose
Quick as her eyes , and as unfix 'd as those

Favours to none , to all she smiles extends
Oft she rejects , but never once offends

Bright as the sun , her eyes the gazers strike
And , like the sun , they shine on all alike

Yet graceful ease , and sweetness void of pride
Might hide her faults , if Belles had faults to hide

If to her share some female errors fall
Look on her face , and you 'll forget 'em all

This Nymph , to the destruction of mankind
Nourish 'd two Locks , which graceful hung behind

In equal curls , and well conspir 'd to deck
With shining ringlets the smooth iv'ry neck

Love in these labyrinths his slaves detains
And mighty hearts are held in slender chains

With hairy springes we the birds betray
Slight lines of hair surprise the finny prey

Fair tresses man 's imperial race ensnare
And beauty draws us with a single hair

Th ' advent'rous Baron the bright locks admired
He saw , he wish 'd , and to the prize aspired

Resolv 'd to win , he meditates the way
By force to ravish , or by fraud betray

For when success a Lover 's toil attends
Few ask , if fraud or force attain 'd his ends

For this , ere Phoebus rose , he had implored
Propitious heav'n , and ev'ry pow ' r adored

But chiefly Love -- to Love an Altar built
Of twelve vast French Romances , neatly gilt

There lay three garters , half a pair of gloves
And all the trophies of his former loves

With tender Billet-doux he lights the pyre
And breathes three am'rous sighs to raise the fire

Then prostrate falls , and begs with ardent eyes
Soon to obtain , and long possess the prize

The pow'rs gave ear , and granted half his pray ' r
The rest , the winds dispers 'd in empty air

But now secure the painted vessel glides
The sun-beams trembling on the floating tides

While melting music steals upon the sky
And soften 'd sounds along the waters die

Smooth flow the waves , the Zephyrs gently play
Belinda smil 'd , and all the world was gay

All but the Sylph -- with careful thoughts opprest
Th ' impending woe sat heavy on his breast

He summons strait his Denizens of air
The lucid squadrons round the sails repair

Soft o'er the shrouds aerial whispers breathe
That seem 'd but Zephyrs to the train beneath

Some to the sun their insect-wings unfold
Waft on the breeze , or sink in clouds of gold

Transparent forms , too fine for mortal sight
Their fluid bodies half dissolv 'd in light

Loose to the wind their airy garments flew
Thin glitt'ring textures of the filmy dew

Dipt in the richest tincture of the skies
Where light disports in ever-mingling dyes

While ev'ry beam new transient colours flings
Colours that change whene'er they wave their wings

Amid the circle , on the gilded mast
Superior by the head , was Ariel placed

His purple pinions op'ning to the sun
He rais 'd his azure wand , and thus begun

Ye Sylphs and Sylphids , to your chief give ear
Fays , Fairies , Genii , Elves , and Daemons , hear

Ye know the spheres and various tasks assigned
By laws eternal to th ' aerial kind

Some in the fields of purest AEther play
And bask and whiten in the blaze of day

Some guide the course of wand'ring orbs on high
Or roll the planets thro ' the boundless sky

Some less refin 'd , beneath the moon 's pale light
Pursue the stars that shoot athwart the night

Or suck the mists in grosser air below
Or dip their pinions in the painted bow

Or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main
Or o'er the glebe distil the kindly rain

Others on earth o'er human race preside
Watch all their ways , and all their actions guide

Of these the chief the care of Nations own
And guard with Arms divine the British Throne

Our humbler province is to tend the Fair
Not a less pleasing , tho ' less glorious care

To save the powder from too rude a gale
Nor let th ' imprison'd-essences exhale

To draw fresh colours from the vernal flow'rs
To steal from rainbows e'er they drop in show'rs

A brighter wash ; to curl their waving hairs
Assist their blushes , and inspire their airs

Nay oft , in dreams , invention we bestow
To change a Flounce , or add a Furbelow

This day , black Omens threat the brightest Fair
That e'er deserv 'd a watchful spirit 's care

Some dire disaster , or by force , or slight
But what , or where , the fates have wrapt in night

Whether the nymph shall break Diana 's law
Or some frail China jar receive a flaw

Or stain her honour or her new brocade
Forget her pray'rs , or miss a masquerade

Or lose her heart , or necklace , at a ball
Or whether Heav'n has doom 'd that Shock must fall

Haste , then , ye spirits ! to your charge repair
The flutt'ring fan be Zephyretta 's care

The drops to thee , Brillante , we consign
And , Momentilla , let the watch be thine

Do thou , Crispissa , tend her fav'rite Lock
Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock

To fifty chosen Sylphs , of special note
We trust th ' important charge , the Petticoat

Oft have we known that seven-fold fence to fail
Tho ' stiff with hoops , and arm 'd with ribs of whale

Form a strong line about the silver bound
And guard the wide circumference around

Whatever spirit , careless of his charge
His post neglects , or leaves the fair at large

Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins
Be stopp 'd in vials , or transfix 'd with pins

Or plung 'd in lakes of bitter washes lie
Or wedg 'd whole ages in a bodkin 's eye

Gums and Pomatums shall his flight restrain
While clogg 'd he beats his silken wings in vain

Or Alum styptics with contracting pow ' r
Shrink his thin essence like a rivel 'd flow ' r

Or , as Ixion fix 'd , the wretch shall feel
The giddy motion of the whirling Mill

In fumes of burning Chocolate shall glow
And tremble at the sea that froths below

He spoke ; the spirits from the sails descend
Some , orb in orb , around the nymph extend

Some thrid the mazy ringlets of her hair
Some hang upon the pendants of her ear

With beating hearts the dire event they wait
Anxious , and trembling for the birth of Fate

Close by those meads , for ever crown 'd with flow'rs
Where Thames with pride surveys his rising tow'rs

There stands a structure of majestic frame
Which from the neighb'ring Hampton takes its name

Here Britain 's statesmen oft the fall foredoom
Of foreign Tyrants and of Nymphs at home

Here thou , great ANNA ! whom three realms obey
Dost sometimes counsel take -- and sometimes Tea

Hither the heroes and the nymphs resort
To taste awhile the pleasures of a Court

In various talk th ' instructive hours they past
Who gave the ball , or paid the visit last

One speaks the glory of the British Queen
And one describes a charming Indian screen

A third interprets motions , looks , and eyes
At ev'ry word a reputation dies

Snuff , or the fan , supply each pause of chat
With singing , laughing , ogling , and _all that_

Mean while , declining from the noon of day
The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray

The hungry Judges soon the sentence sign
And wretches hang that jury-men may dine

The merchant from th ' Exchange returns in peace
And the long labours of the Toilet cease

Belinda now , whom thirst of fame invites
Burns to encounter two advent'rous Knights

At Ombre singly to decide their doom
And swells her breast with conquests yet to come

Straight the three bands prepare in arms to join
Each band the number of the sacred nine

Soon as she spreads her hand , th ' aerial guard
Descend , and sit on each important card

First Ariel perch 'd upon a Matadore
Then each , according to the rank they bore

For Sylphs , yet mindful of their ancient race
Are , as when women , wondrous fond of place

Behold , four Kings in majesty revered
With hoary whiskers and a forky beard

And four fair Queens whose hands sustain a flow ' r
Th ' expressive emblem of their softer pow ' r

Four Knaves in garbs succinct , a trusty band
Caps on their heads , and halberts in their hand

And particolour 'd troops , a shining train
Draw forth to combat on the velvet plain

The skilful Nymph reviews her force with care
Let Spades be trumps ! she said , and trumps they were

Now move to war her sable Matadores
In show like leaders of the swarthy Moors

Spadillio first , unconquerable Lord
Led off two captive trumps , and swept the board

As many more Manillio forc 'd to yield
And march 'd a victor from the verdant field

Him Basto follow 'd , but his fate more hard
Gain 'd but one trump and one Plebeian card

With his broad sabre next , a chief in years
The hoary Majesty of Spades appears

Puts forth one manly leg , to sight revealed
The rest , his many-colour 'd robe concealed

The rebel Knave , who dares his prince engage
Proves the just victim of his royal rage

Ev'n mighty Pam , that Kings and Queens o'erthrew
And mow 'd down armies in the fights of Lu

Sad chance of war ! now destitute of aid
Falls undistinguish 'd by the victor spade

Thus far both armies to Belinda yield
Now to the Baron fate inclines the field

His warlike Amazon her host invades
Th ' imperial consort of the crown of Spades

The Club 's black Tyrant first her victim dyed
Spite of his haughty mien , and barb'rous pride

What boots the regal circle on his head
His giant limbs , in state unwieldy spread

That long behind he trails his pompous robe
And , of all monarchs , only grasps the globe

The Baron now his Diamonds pours apace
Th ' embroider 'd King who shows but half his face

And his refulgent Queen , with pow'rs combined
Of broken troops an easy conquest find

Clubs , Diamonds , Hearts , in wild disorder seen
With throngs promiscuous strow the level green

Thus when dispers 'd a routed army runs
Of Asia 's troops , and Afric 's sable sons

With like confusion different nations fly
Of various habit , and of various dye

The pierc 'd battalions dis-united fall
In heaps on heaps ; one fate o'erwhelms them all

The Knave of Diamonds tries his wily arts
And wins ( oh shameful chance ! ) the Queen of Hearts

At this , the blood the virgin 's cheek forsook
A livid paleness spreads o'er all her look

She sees , and trembles at th ' approaching ill
Just in the jaws of ruin , and Codille

And now ( as oft in some distemper 'd State
On one nice Trick depends the gen'ral fate

An Ace of Hearts steps forth : The King unseen
Lurk 'd in her hand , and mourn 'd his captive Queen

He springs to Vengeance with an eager pace
And falls like thunder on the prostrate Ace

The nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky
The walls , the woods , and long canals reply

Oh thoughtless mortals ! ever blind to fate
Too soon dejected , and too soon elate

Sudden , these honours shall be snatch 'd away
And curs 'd for ever this victorious day

For lo ! the board with cups and spoons is crowned
The berries crackle , and the mill turns round

On shining Altars of Japan they raise
The silver lamp ; the fiery spirits blaze

From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide
While China 's earth receives the smoking tide

At once they gratify their scent and taste
And frequent cups prolong the rich repast

Straight hover round the Fair her airy band
Some , as she sipp 'd , the fuming liquor fanned

Some o'er her lap their careful plumes displayed
Trembling , and conscious of the rich brocade

Coffee , ( which makes the politician wise
And see thro ' all things with his half-shut eyes

Sent up in vapours to the Baron 's brain
New Stratagems , the radiant Lock to gain

Ah cease , rash youth ! desist ere't is too late
Fear the just Gods , and think of Scylla 's Fate

Chang 'd to a bird , and sent to flit in air
She dearly pays for Nisus ' injur 'd hair

But when to mischief mortals bend their will
How soon they find fit instruments of ill

Just then , Clarissa drew with tempting grace
A two-edg 'd weapon from her shining case

So Ladies in Romance assist their Knight
Present the spear , and arm him for the fight

He takes the gift with rev'rence , and extends
The little engine on his fingers ' ends

This just behind Belinda 's neck he spread
As o'er the fragrant steams she bends her head

Swift to the Lock a thousand Sprites repair
A thousand wings , by turns , blow back the hair

And thrice they twitch 'd the diamond in her ear
Thrice she look 'd back , and thrice the foe drew near

Just in that instant , anxious Ariel sought
The close recesses of the Virgin 's thought

As on the nosegay in her breast reclined
He watch 'd th ' Ideas rising in her mind

Sudden he view 'd , in spite of all her art
An earthly Lover lurking at her heart

Amaz 'd , confus 'd , he found his pow ' r expired
Resign 'd to fate , and with a sigh retired

The Peer now spreads the glitt'ring Forfex wide
T ' inclose the Lock ; now joins it , to divide

Ev'n then , before the fatal engine closed
A wretched Sylph too fondly interposed

Fate urg 'd the shears , and cut the Sylph in twain
( But airy substance soon unites again

The meeting points the sacred hair dissever
From the fair head , for ever , and for ever

Then flash 'd the living lightning from her eyes
And screams of horror rend th ' affrighted skies

Not louder shrieks to pitying heav'n are cast
When husbands , or when lapdogs breathe their last

Or when rich China vessels fall'n from high
In glitt'ring dust and painted fragments lie

Let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine
( The victor cry 'd ) the glorious Prize is mine

While fish in streams , or birds delight in air
Or in a coach and six the British Fair

As long as Atalantis shall be read
Or the small pillow grace a Lady 's bed

While visits shall be paid on solemn days
When num'rous wax-lights in bright order blaze

While nymphs take treats , or assignations give
So long my honour , name , and praise shall live

What Time would spare , from Steel receives its date
And monuments , like men , submit to fate

Steel could the labour of the Gods destroy
And strike to dust th ' imperial tow'rs of Troy

Steel could the works of mortal pride confound
And hew triumphal arches to the ground

What wonder then , fair nymph ! thy hairs should feel
The conqu'ring force of unresisted steel

But anxious cares the pensive nymph oppressed
And secret passions labour 'd in her breast

Not youthful kings in battle seiz 'd alive
Not scornful virgins who their charms survive

Not ardent lovers robb 'd of all their bliss
Not ancient ladies when refus 'd a kiss

Not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die
Not Cynthia when her manteau 's pinn 'd awry

E'er felt such rage , resentment , and despair
As thou , sad Virgin ! for thy ravish 'd Hair

For , that sad moment , when the Sylphs withdrew
And Ariel weeping from Belinda flew

Umbriel , a dusky , melancholy sprite
As ever sully 'd the fair face of light

Down to the central earth , his proper scene
Repair 'd to search the gloomy Cave of Spleen

Swift on his sooty pinions flits the Gnome
And in a vapour reach 'd the dismal dome

No cheerful breeze this sullen region knows
The dreaded East is all the wind that blows

Here in a grotto , shelter 'd close from air
And screen 'd in shades from day 's detested glare

She sighs for ever on her pensive bed
Pain at her side , and Megrim at her head

Two handmaids wait the throne : alike in place
But diff'ring far in figure and in face

Here stood Ill-nature like an ancient maid
Her wrinkled form in black and white arrayed

With store of pray'rs , for mornings , nights , and noons
Her hand is fill 'd ; her bosom with lampoons

There Affectation , with a sickly mien
Shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen

Practis 'd to lisp , and hang the head aside
Faints into airs , and languishes with pride

On the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe
Wrapt in a gown , for sickness , and for show

The fair ones feel such maladies as these
When each new night-dress gives a new disease

A constant Vapour o'er the palace flies
Strange phantoms rising as the mists arise

Dreadful , as hermit 's dreams in haunted shades
Or bright , as visions of expiring maids

Now glaring fiends , and snakes on rolling spires
Pale spectres , gaping tombs , and purple fires

Now lakes of liquid gold , Elysian scenes
And crystal domes , and angels in machines

Unnumber 'd throngs on every side are seen
Of bodies chang 'd to various forms by Spleen

Here living Tea-pots stand , one arm held out
One bent ; the handle this , and that the spout

A Pipkin there , like Homer 's Tripod walks
Here sighs a Jar , and there a Goose-pie talks

Men prove with child , as pow'rful fancy works
And maids turn 'd bottles , call aloud for corks

Safe past the Gnome thro ' this fantastic band
A branch of healing Spleenwort in his hand

Then thus address 'd the pow ' r : `` Hail , wayward Queen
Who rule the sex to fifty from fifteen

Parent of vapours and of female wit
Who give th ' hysteric , or poetic fit

On various tempers act by various ways
Make some take physic , others scribble plays

Who cause the proud their visits to delay
And send the godly in a pet to pray

A nymph there is , that all thy pow ' r disdains
And thousands more in equal mirth maintains

But oh ! if e'er thy Gnome could spoil a grace
Or raise a pimple on a beauteous face

Like Citron-waters matrons cheeks inflame
Or change complexions at a losing game

If e'er with airy horns I planted heads
Or rumpled petticoats , or tumbled beds

Or caus 'd suspicion when no soul was rude
Or discompos 'd the head-dress of a Prude

Or e'er to costive lap-dog gave disease
Which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease

Hear me , and touch Belinda with chagrin
That single act gives half the world the spleen

The Goddess with a discontented air
Seems to reject him , tho ' she grants his pray ' r

A wond'rous Bag with both her hands she binds
Like that where once Ulysses held the winds

There she collects the force of female lungs
Sighs , sobs , and passions , and the war of tongues

A Vial next she fills with fainting fears
Soft sorrows , melting griefs , and flowing tears

The Gnome rejoicing bears her gifts away
Spreads his black wings , and slowly mounts to day

Sunk in Thalestris ' arms the nymph he found
Her eyes dejected and her hair unbound

Full o'er their heads the swelling bag he rent
And all the Furies issu 'd at the vent

Belinda burns with more than mortal ire
And fierce Thalestris fans the rising fire

`` O wretched maid ! '' she spread her hands , and cryed
( While Hampton 's echoes , `` Wretched maid ! '' replyed

`` Was it for this you took such constant care
The bodkin , comb , and essence to prepare

For this your locks in paper durance bound
For this with tort'ring irons wreath 'd around

For this with fillets strain 'd your tender head
And bravely bore the double loads of lead

Gods ! shall the ravisher display your hair
While the Fops envy , and the Ladies stare

Honour forbid ! at whose unrivall 'd shrine
Ease , pleasure , virtue , all our sex resign

Methinks already I your tears survey
Already hear the horrid things they say

Already see you a degraded toast
And all your honour in a whisper lost

How shall I , then , your helpless fame defend
'T will then be infamy to seem your friend

And shall this prize , th ' inestimable prize
Expos 'd thro ' crystal to the gazing eyes

And heighten 'd by the diamond 's circling rays
On that rapacious hand for ever blaze

Sooner shall grass in Hyde-park Circus grow
And wits take lodgings in the sound of Bow

Sooner let earth , air , sea , to Chaos fall
Men , monkeys , lap-dogs , parrots , perish all

She said ; then raging to Sir Plume repairs
And bids her Beau demand the precious hairs

( Sir Plume of amber snuff-box justly vain
And the nice conduct of a clouded cane

With earnest eyes , and round unthinking face
He first the snuff-box open 'd , then the case

And thus broke out -- '' My Lord , why , what the devil
`` Z -- ds ! damn the lock ! 'fore Gad , you must be civil

Plague o n't ! 't is past a jest -- nay prithee , pox
Give her the hair '' -- he spoke , and rapp 'd his box

`` It grieves me much '' ( reply 'd the Peer again
`` Who speaks so well should ever speak in vain

But by this Lock , this sacred Lock I swear
( Which never more shall join its parted hair

Which never more its honours shall renew
Clipp 'd from the lovely head where late it grew

That while my nostrils draw the vital air
This hand , which won it , shall for ever wear

He spoke , and speaking , in proud triumph spread
The long-contended honours of her head

But Umbriel , hateful Gnome ! forbears not so
He breaks the Vial whence the sorrows flow

Then see ! the nymph in beauteous grief appears
Her eyes half-languishing , half-drown 'd in tears

On her heav 'd bosom hung her drooping head
Which , with a sigh , she rais 'd ; and thus she said

`` For ever curs 'd be this detested day
Which snatch 'd my best , my fav'rite curl away

Happy ! ah ten times happy had I been
If Hampton-Court these eyes had never seen

Yet am not I the first mistaken maid
By love of Courts to num'rous ills betrayed

Oh had I rather un-admir 'd remained
In some lone isle , or distant Northern land

Where the gilt Chariot never marks the way
Where none learn Ombre , none e'er taste Bohea

There kept my charms conceal 'd from mortal eye
Like roses , that in deserts bloom and die

What mov 'd my mind with youthful Lords to roam
Oh had I stay 'd , and said my pray'rs at home

'T was this , the morning omens seem 'd to tell
Thrice from my trembling hand the patch-box fell

The tott'ring China shook without a wind
Nay , Poll sat mute , and Shock was most unkind

A Sylph too warn 'd me of the threats of fate
In mystic visions , now believ 'd too late

See the poor remnants of these slighted hairs
My hands shall rend what ev'n thy rapine spares

These in two sable ringlets taught to break
Once gave new beauties to the snowy neck

The sister-lock now sits uncouth , alone
And in its fellow 's fate foresees its own

Uncurl 'd it hangs , the fatal shears demands
And tempts once more thy sacrilegious hands

Oh hadst thou , cruel ! been content to seize
Hairs less in sight , or any hairs but these

She said : the pitying audience melt in tears
But Fate and Jove had stopp 'd the Baron 's ears

In vain Thalestris with reproach assails
For who can move when fair Belinda fails

Not half so fix 'd the Trojan could remain
While Anna begg 'd and Dido rag 'd in vain

Then grave Clarissa graceful wav 'd her fan
Silence ensu 'd , and thus the nymph began

`` Say why are Beauties prais 'd and honour 'd most
The wise man 's passion , and the vain man 's toast

Why deck 'd with all that land and sea afford
Why Angels call 'd , and Angel-like adored

Why round our coaches crowd the white-glov 'd Beaux
Why bows the side-box from its inmost rows

How vain are all these glories , all our pains
Unless good sense preserve what beauty gains

That men may say , when we the front-box grace
'Behold the first in virtue as in face

Oh ! if to dance all night , and dress all day
Charm 'd the small-pox , or chas 'd old-age away

Who would not scorn what housewife 's cares produce
Or who would learn one earthly thing of use

To patch , nay ogle , might become a Saint
Nor could it sure be such a sin to paint

But since , alas ! frail beauty must decay
Curl 'd or uncurl 'd , since Locks will turn to grey

Since painted , or not painted , all shall fade
And she who scorns a man , must die a maid

What then remains but well our pow ' r to use
And keep good-humour still whate'er we lose

And trust me , dear ! good-humour can prevail
When airs , and flights , and screams , and scolding fail

Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll
Charms strike the sight , but merit wins the soul

So spoke the Dame , but no applause ensued
Belinda frown 'd , Thalestris call 'd her Prude

`` To arms , to arms ! '' the fierce Virago cries
And swift as lightning to the combat flies

All side in parties , and begin th ' attack
Fans clap , silks rustle , and tough whalebones crack

Heroes ' and Heroines ' shouts confus'dly rise
And bass , and treble voices strike the skies

No common weapons in their hands are found
Like Gods they fight , nor dread a mortal wound

So when bold Homer makes the Gods engage
And heav'nly breasts with human passions rage

'Gainst Pallas , Mars ; Latona , Hermes arms
And all Olympus rings with loud alarms

Jove 's thunder roars , heav'n trembles all around
Blue Neptune storms , the bellowing deeps resound

Earth shakes her nodding tow'rs , the ground gives way
And the pale ghosts start at the flash of day

Triumphant Umbriel on a sconce 's height
Clapp 'd his glad wings , and sate to view the fight

Propp 'd on the bodkin spears , the Sprites survey
The growing combat , or assist the fray

While thro ' the press enrag 'd Thalestris flies
And scatters death around from both her eyes

A Beau and Witling perish 'd in the throng
One died in metaphor , and one in song

`` O cruel nymph ! a living death I bear
Cry 'd Dapperwit , and sunk beside his chair

A mournful glance Sir Fopling upwards cast
`` Those eyes are made so killing '' -- was his last

Thus on Maeander 's flow'ry margin lies
Th ' expiring Swan , and as he sings he dies

When bold Sir Plume had drawn Clarissa down
Chloe stepp 'd in , and kill 'd him with a frown

She smil 'd to see the doughty hero slain
But , at her smile , the Beau reviv 'd again

Now Jove suspends his golden scales in air
Weighs the Men 's wits against the Lady 's hair

The doubtful beam long nods from side to side
At length the wits mount up , the hairs subside

See , fierce Belinda on the Baron flies
With more than usual lightning in her eyes

Nor fear 'd the Chief th ' unequal fight to try
Who sought no more than on his foe to die

But this bold Lord with manly strength endued
She with one finger and a thumb subdued

Just where the breath of life his nostrils drew
A charge of Snuff the wily virgin threw

The Gnomes direct , to ev'ry atom just
The pungent grains of titillating dust

Sudden , with starting tears each eye o'erflows
And the high dome re-echoes to his nose

Now meet thy fate , incens 'd Belinda cryed
And drew a deadly bodkin from her side

( The same , his ancient personage to deck
Her great great grandsire wore about his neck

In three seal-rings ; which after , melted down
Form 'd a vast buckle for his widow 's gown

Her infant grandame 's whistle next it grew
The bells she jingled , and the whistle blew

Then in a bodkin grac 'd her mother 's hairs
Which long she wore , and now Belinda wears

`` Boast not my fall '' ( he cry 'd ) `` insulting foe
Thou by some other shalt be laid as low

Nor think , to die dejects my lofty mind
All that I dread is leaving you behind

Rather than so , ah let me still survive
And burn in Cupid 's flames -- but burn alive

`` Restore the Lock ! '' she cries ; and all around
`` Restore the Lock ! '' the vaulted roofs rebound

Not fierce Othello in so loud a strain
Roar 'd for the handkerchief that caus 'd his pain

But see how oft ambitious aims are crossed
And chiefs contend 'till all the prize is lost

The Lock , obtain 'd with guilt , and kept with pain
In ev'ry place is sought , but sought in vain

With such a prize no mortal must be blest
So heav'n decrees ! with heav'n who can contest

Some thought it mounted to the Lunar sphere
Since all things lost on earth are treasur 'd there

There Hero 's wits are kept in pond'rous vases
And beau 's in snuff-boxes and tweezer-cases

There broken vows and death-bed alms are found
And lovers ' hearts with ends of riband bound

The courtier 's promises , and sick man 's pray'rs
The smiles of harlots , and the tears of heirs

Cages for gnats , and chains to yoke a flea
Dry 'd butterflies , and tomes of casuistry

But trust the Muse -- she saw it upward rise
Tho ' mark 'd by none but quick , poetic eyes

( So Rome 's great founder to the heav'ns withdrew
To Proculus alone confess 'd in view

A sudden Star , it shot thro ' liquid air
And drew behind a radiant trail of hair

Not Berenice 's Locks first rose so bright
The heav'ns bespangling with dishevell 'd light

The Sylphs behold it kindling as it flies
And pleas 'd pursue its progress thro ' the skies

This the Beau monde shall from the Mall survey
And hail with music its propitious ray

This the blest Lover shall for Venus take
And send up vows from Rosamonda 's lake

This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies
When next he looks thro ' Galileo 's eyes

And hence th ' egregious wizard shall foredoom
The fate of Louis , and the fall of Rome

Then cease , bright Nymph ! to mourn thy ravish 'd hair
Which adds new glory to the shining sphere

Not all the tresses that fair head can boast
Shall draw such envy as the Lock you lost

For , after all the murders of your eye
When , after millions slain , yourself shall die

When those fair suns shall set , as set they must
And all those tresses shall be laid in dust

This Lock , the Muse shall consecrate to fame
And 'midst the stars inscribe Belinda 's name

'T is hard to say , if greater want of skill
Appear in writing or in judging ill

But , of the two , less dang'rous is th ' offence
To tire our patience , than mislead our sense

Some few in that , but numbers err in this
Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss

A fool might once himself alone expose
Now one in verse makes many more in prose

'T is with our judgments as our watches , none
Go just alike , yet each believes his own

In Poets as true genius is but rare
True Taste as seldom is the Critic 's share

Both must alike from Heav'n derive their light
These born to judge , as well as those to write

Let such teach others who themselves excel
And censure freely who have written well

Authors are partial to their wit , 't is true
But are not Critics to their judgment too

Yet if we look more closely , we shall find
Most have the seeds of judgment in their mind

Nature affords at least a glimm'ring light
The lines , tho ' touch 'd but faintly , are drawn right

But as the slightest sketch , if justly traced
Is by ill-colouring but the more disgraced

Some are bewilder 'd in the maze of schools
And some made coxcombs Nature meant but fools

In search of wit these lose their common sense
And then turn Critics in their own defence

Each burns alike , who can , or can not write
Or with a Rival 's , or an Eunuch 's spite

All fools have still an itching to deride
And fain would be upon the laughing side

If Maevius scribble in Apollo 's spite
There are who judge still worse than he can write

Some have at first for Wits , then Poets past
Turn 'd Critics next , and prov 'd plain fools at last

Some neither can for Wits nor Critics pass
As heavy mules are neither horse nor ass

Those half-learn 'd witlings , num'rous in our isle
As half-form 'd insects on the banks of Nile

Unfinish 'd things , one knows not what to call
Their generation 's so equivocal

To tell 'em , would a hundred tongues require
Or one vain wit 's , that might a hundred tire

But you who seek to give and merit fame
And justly bear a Critic 's noble name

Be sure yourself and your own reach to know
How far your genius , taste , and learning go

Launch not beyond your depth , but be discreet
And mark that point where sense and dulness meet

Nature to all things fix 'd the limits fit
And wisely curb 'd proud man 's pretending wit

As on the land while here the ocean gains
In other parts it leaves wide sandy plains

Thus in the soul while memory prevails
The solid pow ' r of understanding fails

Where beams of warm imagination play
The memory 's soft figures melt away

One science only will one genius fit
So vast is art , so narrow human wit

Not only bounded to peculiar arts
But oft in those confin 'd to single parts

Like kings we lose the conquests gain 'd before
By vain ambition still to make them more

Each might his sev'ral province well command
Would all but stoop to what they understand

First follow Nature , and your judgment frame
By her just standard , which is still the same

Unerring NATURE , still divinely bright
One clear , unchang 'd , and universal light

Life , force , and beauty , must to all impart
At once the source , and end , and test of Art

Art from that fund each just supply provides
Works without show , and without pomp presides

In some fair body thus th ' informing soul
With spirits feeds , with vigour fills the whole

Each motion guides , and ev'ry nerve sustains
Itself unseen , but in th ' effects , remains

Some , to whom Heav'n in wit has been profuse
Want as much more , to turn it to its use

For wit and judgment often are at strife
Tho ' meant each other 's aid , like man and wife

'T is more to guide , than spur the Muse 's steed
Restrain his fury , than provoke his speed

The winged courser , like a gen'rous horse
Shows most true mettle when you check his course

Those RULES of old discovered , not devised
Are Nature still , but Nature methodized

Nature , like liberty , is but restrained
By the same laws which first herself ordained

Hear how learn 'd Greece her useful rules indites
When to repress , and when indulge our flights

High on Parnassus ' top her sons she showed
And pointed out those arduous paths they trod

Held from afar , aloft , th ' immortal prize
And urg 'd the rest by equal steps to rise

Just precepts thus from great examples giv'n
She drew from them what they deriv 'd from Heav'n

The gen'rous Critic fann 'd the Poet 's fire
And taught the world with reason to admire

Then Criticism the Muse 's handmaid proved
To dress her charms , and make her more beloved

But following wits from that intention strayed
Who could not win the mistress , woo 'd the maid

Against the Poets their own arms they turned
Sure to hate most the men from whom they learned

So modern 'Pothecaries , taught the art
By Doctor 's bills to play the Doctor 's part

Bold in the practice of mistaken rules
Prescribe , apply , and call their masters fools

Some on the leaves of ancient authors prey
Nor time nor moths e'er spoil 'd so much as they

Some drily plain , without invention 's aid
Write dull receipts how poems may be made

These leave the sense , their learning to display
And those explain the meaning quite away

You then whose judgment the right course would steer
Know well each ANCIENT 'S proper character

His fable , subject , scope in ev'ry page
Religion , Country , genius of his Age

Without all these at once before your eyes
Cavil you may , but never criticize

Be Homer 's works your study and delight
Read them by day , and meditate by night

Thence form your judgment , thence your maxims bring
And trace the Muses upward to their spring

Still with itself compar 'd , his text peruse
And let your comment be the Mantuan Muse

When first young Maro in his boundless mind
A work t ' outlast immortal Rome designed

Perhaps he seem 'd above the critic 's law
And but from Nature 's fountains scorn 'd to draw

But when t ' examine ev'ry part he came
Nature and Homer were , he found , the same

Convinc 'd , amaz 'd , he checks the bold design
And rules as strict his labour 'd work confine

Learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem
To copy nature is to copy them

Some beauties yet no Precepts can declare
For there 's a happiness as well as care

Music resembles Poetry , in each
Are nameless graces which no methods teach

If , where the rules not far enough extend
( Since rules were made but to promote their end

Some lucky Licence answer to the full
Th ' intent propos 'd , that Licence is a rule

Thus Pegasus , a nearer way to take
May boldly deviate from the common track

From vulgar bounds with brave disorder part
And snatch a grace beyond the reach of art

Which without passing thro ' the judgment , gains
The heart , and all its end at once attains

In prospects thus , some objects please our eyes
Which out of nature 's common order rise

Great wits sometimes may gloriously offend
And rise to faults true Critics dare not mend

But tho ' the Ancients thus their rules invade
( As Kings dispense with laws themselves have made

Moderns , beware ! or if you must offend
Against the precept , ne'er transgress its End

Let it be seldom , and compell 'd by need
And have , at least , their precedent to plead

The Critic else proceeds without remorse
Seizes your fame , and puts his laws in force

I know there are , to whose presumptuous thoughts
Those freer beauties , ev'n in them , seem faults

Some figures monstrous and mis-shap 'd appear
Consider 'd singly , or beheld too near

Which , but proportion 'd to their light , or place
Due distance reconciles to form and grace

A prudent chief not always must display
His pow'rs in equal ranks , and fair array

But with th ' occasion and the place comply
Conceal his force , nay seem sometimes to fly

Those oft are stratagems which error seem
Nor is it Homer nods , but we that dream

Still green with bays each ancient Altar stands
Above the reach of sacrilegious hands

Secure from Flames , from Envy 's fiercer rage
Destructive War , and all-involving Age

See , from each clime the learn 'd their incense bring
Hear , in all tongues consenting Paeans ring

In praise so just let ev'ry voice be joined
And fill the gen'ral chorus of mankind

Hail , Bards triumphant ! born in happier days
Immortal heirs of universal praise

Whose honours with increase of ages grow
As streams roll down , enlarging as they flow

Nations unborn your mighty names shall sound
And worlds applaud that must not yet be found

Oh may some spark of your celestial fire
The last , the meanest of your sons inspire

( That on weak wings , from far , pursues your flights
Glows while he reads , but trembles as he writes

To teach vain Wits a science little known
T ' admire superior sense , and doubt their own

Of all the Causes which conspire to blind
Man 's erring judgment , and misguide the mind

What the weak head with strongest bias rules
Is _Pride_ , the never-failing voice of fools

Whatever nature has in worth denied
She gives in large recruits of needful pride

For as in bodies , thus in souls , we find
What wants in blood and spirits , swell 'd with wind

Pride , where wit fails , steps in to our defence
And fills up all the mighty Void of sense

If once right reason drives that cloud away
Truth breaks upon us with resistless day

Trust not yourself ; but your defects to know
Make use of ev'ry friend -- and ev'ry foe

A _little learning_ is a dang'rous thing
Drink deep , or taste not the Pierian spring

There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain
And drinking largely sobers us again

Fir 'd at first sight with what the Muse imparts
In fearless youth we tempt the heights of Arts

While from the bounded level of our mind
Short views we take , nor see the lengths behind

But more advanc 'd , behold with strange surprise
New distant scenes of endless science rise

So pleas 'd at first the tow'ring Alps we try
Mount o'er the vales , and seem to tread the sky

Th ' eternal snows appear already past
And the first clouds and mountains seem the last

But , those attain 'd , we tremble to survey
The growing labours of the lengthen 'd way

Th ' increasing prospect tires our wand'ring eyes
Hills peep o'er hills , and Alps on Alps arise

A perfect Judge will read each work of Wit
With the same spirit that its author writ

Survey the WHOLE , nor seek slight faults to find
Where nature moves , and rapture warms the mind

Nor lose , for that malignant dull delight
The gen'rous pleasure to be charm 'd with Wit

But in such lays as neither ebb , nor flow
Correctly cold , and regularly low

That shunning faults , one quiet tenour keep
We can not blame indeed -- but we may sleep

In wit , as nature , what affects our hearts
Is not th ' exactness of peculiar parts

'T is not a lip , or eye , we beauty call
But the joint force and full result of all

Thus when we view some well-proportion 'd dome
( The world 's just wonder , and ev'n thine , O Rome

No single parts unequally surprize
All comes united to th ' admiring eyes

No monstrous height , or breadth , or length appear
The Whole at once is bold , and regular

Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see
Thinks what ne'er was , nor is , nor e'er shall be

In every work regard the writer 's End
Since none can compass more than they intend

And if the means be just , the conduct true
Applause , in spight of trivial faults , is due

As men of breeding , sometimes men of wit
T ' avoid great errors , must the less commit

Neglect the rules each verbal Critic lays
For not to know some trifles , is a praise

Most Critics , fond of some subservient art
Still make the Whole depend upon a Part

They talk of principles , but notions prize
And all to one lov 'd Folly sacrifice

Once on a time , La Mancha 's Knight , they say
A certain bard encount'ring on the way

Discours 'd in terms as just , with looks as sage
As e'er could Dennis of the Grecian stage

Concluding all were desp'rate sots and fools
Who durst depart from Aristotle 's rules

Our Author , happy in a judge so nice
Produc 'd his Play , and begg 'd the Knight 's advice

Made him observe the subject , and the plot
The manners , passions , unities ; what not

All which , exact to rule , were brought about
Were but a Combat in the lists left out

`` What ! leave the Combat out ? '' exclaims the Knight
Yes , or we must renounce the Stagirite

`` Not so , by Heav'n '' ( he answers in a rage
`` Knights , squires , and steeds , must enter on the stage

So vast a throng the stage can ne'er contain
`` Then build a new , or act it in a plain

Thus Critics , of less judgment than caprice
Curious not knowing , not exact but nice

Form short Ideas ; and offend in arts
( As most in manners ) by a love to parts

Some to _Conceit_ alone their taste confine
And glitt'ring thoughts struck out at ev'ry line

Pleas 'd with a work where nothing 's just or fit
One glaring Chaos and wild heap of wit

Poets like painters , thus , unskill 'd to trace
The naked nature and the living grace

With gold and jewels cover ev'ry part
And hide with ornaments their want of art

True Wit is Nature to advantage dressed
What oft was thought , but ne'er so well expressed

Something , whose truth convinc 'd at sight we find
That gives us back the image of our mind

As shades more sweetly recommend the light
So modest plainness sets off sprightly wit

For works may have more wit than does 'em good
As bodies perish thro ' excess of blood

Others for Language all their care express
And value books , as women men , for Dress

Their praise is still -- the Style is excellent
The Sense , they humbly take upon content

Words are like leaves ; and where they most abound
Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found

False Eloquence , like the prismatic glass
Its gaudy colours spreads on ev'ry place

The face of Nature we no more survey
All glares alike , without distinction gay

But true expression , like th ' unchanging Sun
Clears and improves whate'er it shines upon

Expression is the dress of thought , and still
Appears more decent , as more suitable

A vile conceit in pompous words expressed
Is like a clown in regal purple dressed

For diff'rent styles with diff'rent subjects sort
As several garbs with country , town , and court

Some by old words to fame have made pretence
Ancients in phrase , mere moderns in their sense

Such labour 'd nothings , in so strange a style
Amaze th ' unlearn 'd , and make the learned smile

Unlucky , as Fungoso in the play
These sparks with awkward vanity display

And but so mimic ancient wits at best
As apes our grandsires , in their doublets drest

In words , as fashions , the same rule will hold
Alike fantastic , if too new , or old

Be not the first by whom the new are tryed
Nor yet the last to lay the old aside

But most by Numbers judge a Poet 's song
And smooth or rough , with them is right or wrong

In the bright Muse though thousand charms conspire
Her voice is all these tuneful fools admire

Who haunt Parnassus but to please their ear
Not mend their minds ; as some to Church repair

These equal syllables alone require
Tho ' oft the ear the open vowe 's tire

While expletives their feeble aid do join
And ten low words oft creep in one dull line

While they ring round the same unvary 'd chimes
With sure returns of still expected rhymes

Where-e'er you find `` the cooling western breeze
In the next line , it `` whispers through the trees

If crystal streams `` with pleasing murmurs creep
The reader 's threaten 'd ( not in vain ) with `` sleep

Then , at the last and only couplet fraught
With some unmeaning thing they call a thought

A needless Alexandrine ends the song
That , like a wounded snake , drags its slow length along

Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes , and know
What 's roundly smooth or languishingly slow

And praise the easy vigour of a line
Where Denham 's strength , and Waller 's sweetness join

True ease in writing comes from art , not chance
As those move easiest who have learn 'd to dance

'T is not enough no harshness gives offence
The sound must seem an Echo to the sense

Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows
And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows

But when loud surges lash the sounding shore
The hoarse , rough verse should like the torrent roar

When Ajax strives some rock 's vast weight to throw
The line too labours , and the words move slow

Not so , when swift Camilla scours the plain
Flies o'er th ' unbending corn , and skims along the main

Hear how Timotheus ' varied lays surprize
And bid alternate passions fall and rise

While , at each change , the son of Libyan Jove
Now burns with glory , and then melts with love

Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow
Now sighs steal out , and tears begin to flow

Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found
And the world 's victor stood subdu 'd by Sound

The pow ' r of Music all our hearts allow
And what Timotheus was , is DRYDEN now

Avoid Extremes ; and shun the fault of such
Who still are pleas 'd too little or too much

At ev'ry trifle scorn to take offence
That always shows great pride , or little sense

Those heads , as stomachs , are not sure the best
Which nauseate all , and nothing can digest

Yet let not each gay Turn thy rapture move
For fools admire , but men of sense approve

As things seem large which we thro ' mists descry
Dulness is ever apt to magnify

Some foreign writers , some our own despise
The Ancients only , or the Moderns prize

Thus Wit , like Faith , by each man is applyed
To one small sect , and all are damn 'd beside

Meanly they seek the blessing to confine
And force that sun but on a part to shine

Which not alone the southern wit sublimes
But ripens spirits in cold northern climes

Which from the first has shone on ages past
Enlights the present , and shall warm the last

Tho ' each may feel increases and decays
And see now clearer and now darker days

Regard not then if Wit be old or new
But blame the false , and value still the true

Some ne'er advance a Judgment of their own
But catch the spreading notion of the Town

They reason and conclude by precedent
And own stale nonsense which they ne'er invent

Some judge of author 's names , not works , and then
Nor praise nor blame the writings , but the men

Of all this servile herd the worst is he
That in proud dulness joins with Quality

A constant Critic at the great man 's board
To fetch and carry nonsense for my Lord

What woful stuff this madrigal would be
In some starv 'd hackney sonneteer , or me

But let a Lord once own the happy lines
How the wit brightens ! how the style refines

Before his sacred name flies ev'ry fault
And each exalted stanza teems with thought

The Vulgar thus through Imitation err
As oft the Learn 'd by being singular

So much they scorn the crowd , that if the throng
By chance go right , they purposely go wrong

So Schismatics the plain believers quit
And are but damn 'd for having too much wit

Some praise at morning what they blame at night
But always think the last opinion right

A Muse by these is like a mistress used
This hour she 's idoliz 'd , the next abused

While their weak heads like towns unfortifyed
'Twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side

Ask them the cause ; they 're wiser still , they say
And still to-morrow 's wiser than to-day

We think our fathers fools , so wise we grow
Our wiser sons , no doubt , will think us so

Once School-divines this zealous isle o'er-spread
Who knew most Sentences , was deepest read

Faith , Gospel , all , seem 'd made to be disputed
And none had sense enough to be confuted

Scotists and Thomists , now , in peace remain
Amidst their kindred cobwebs in Duck-lane

If Faith itself has diff'rent dresses worn
What wonder modes in Wit should take their turn

Oft ' , leaving what is natural and fit
The current folly proves the ready wit

And authors think their reputation safe
Which lives as long as fools are pleas 'd to laugh

Some valuing those of their own side or mind
Still make themselves the measure of mankind

Fondly we think we honour merit then
When we but praise ourselves in other men

Parties in Wit attend on those of State
And public faction doubles private hate

Pride , Malice , Folly , against Dryden rose
In various shapes of Parsons , Critics , Beaus

But sense surviv 'd , when merry jests were past
For rising merit will buoy up at last

Might he return , and bless once more our eyes
New Blackmores and new Milbourns must arise

Nay should great Homer lift his awful head
Zoilus again would start up from the dead

Envy will merit , as its shade , pursue
But like a shadow , proves the substance true

For envy 'd Wit , like Sol eclips 'd , makes known
Th ' opposing body 's grossness , not its own

When first that sun too pow'rful beams displays
It draws up vapours which obscure its rays

But ev'n those clouds at last adorn its way
Reflect new glories , and augment the day

Be thou the first true merit to befriend
His praise is lost , who stays , till all commend

Short is the date , alas , of modern rhymes
And 't is but just to let them live betimes

No longer now that golden age appears
When Patriarch-wits surviv 'd a thousand years

Now length of Fame ( our second life ) is lost
And bare threescore is all ev'n that can boast

Our sons their fathers ' failing language see
And such as Chaucer is , shall Dryden be

So when the faithful pencil has designed
Some bright Idea of the master 's mind

Where a new world leaps out at his command
And ready Nature waits upon his hand

When the ripe colours soften and unite
And sweetly melt into just shade and light

When mellowing years their full perfection give
And each bold figure just begins to live

The treach'rous colours the fair art betray
And all the bright creation fades away

Unhappy Wit , like most mistaken things
Atones not for that envy which it brings

In youth alone its empty praise we boast
But soon the short-liv 'd vanity is lost

Like some fair flow ' r the early spring supplies
That gaily blooms , but ev'n in blooming dies

What is this Wit , which must our cares employ
The owner 's wife , that other men enjoy

Then most our trouble still when most admired
And still the more we give , the more required

Whose fame with pains we guard , but lose with ease
Sure some to vex , but never all to please

'T is what the vicious fear , the virtuous shun
By fools't is hated , and by knaves undone

If Wit so much from Ign'rance undergo
Ah let not Learning too commence its foe

Of old , those met rewards who could excel
And such were prais 'd who but endeavour 'd well

Tho ' triumphs were to gen'rals only due
Crowns were reserv 'd to grace the soldiers too

Now , they who reach Parnassus ' lofty crown
Employ their pains to spurn some others down

And while self-love each jealous writer rules
Contending wits become the sport of fools

But still the worst with most regret commend
For each ill Author is as bad a Friend

To what base ends , and by what abject ways
Are mortals urg 'd thro ' sacred lust of praise

Ah ne'er so dire a thirst of glory boast
Nor in the Critic let the Man be lost

Good-nature and good-sense must ever join
To err is human , to forgive , divine

But if in noble minds some dregs remain
Not yet purg 'd off , of spleen and sour disdain

Discharge that rage on more provoking crimes
Nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times

No pardon vile Obscenity should find
Tho ' wit and art conspire to move your mind

But Dulness with Obscenity must prove
As shameful sure as Impotence in love

In the fat age of pleasure wealth and ease
Sprung the rank weed , and thriv 'd with large increase

When love was all an easy Monarch 's care
Seldom at council , never in a war

Jilts rul 'd the state , and statesmen farces writ
Nay wits had pensions , and young Lords had wit

The Fair sate panting at a Courtier 's play
And not a Mask went unimprov 'd away

The modest fan was lifted up no more
And Virgins smil 'd at what they blush 'd before

The following licence of a Foreign reign
Did all the dregs of bold Socinus drain

Then unbelieving priests reform 'd the nation
And taught more pleasant methods of salvation

Where Heav'n 's free subjects might their rights dispute
Lest God himself should seem too absolute

Pulpits their sacred satire learn 'd to spare
And Vice admir 'd to find a flatt'rer there

Encourag 'd thus , Wit 's Titans brav 'd the skies
And the press groan 'd with licens 'd blasphemies

These monsters , Critics ! with your darts engage
Here point your thunder , and exhaust your rage

Yet shun their fault , who , scandalously nice
Will needs mistake an author into vice

All seems infected that th ' infected spy
As all looks yellow to the jaundic 'd eye

Learn then what MORALS Critics ought to show
For't is but half a Judge 's task , to know

'T is not enough , taste , judgment , learning , join
In all you speak , let truth and candour shine

That not alone what to your sense is due
All may allow ; but seek your friendship too

Be silent always when you doubt your sense
And speak , tho ' sure , with seeming diffidence

Some positive , persisting fops we know
Who , if once wrong , will needs be always so

But you , with pleasure own your errors past
And make each day a Critic on the last

'T is not enough , your counsel still be true
Blunt truths more mischief than nice falsehoods do

Men must be taught as if you taught them not
And things unknown propos 'd as things forgot

Without Good Breeding , truth is disapproved
That only makes superior sense beloved

Be niggards of advice on no pretence
For the worst avarice is that of sense

With mean complacence ne'er betray your trust
Nor be so civil as to prove unjust

Fear not the anger of the wise to raise
Those best can bear reproof , who merit praise

'T were well might critics still this freedom take
But Appius reddens at each word you speak

And stares , tremendous , with a threat'ning eye
Like some fierce Tyrant in old tapestry

Fear most to tax an Honourable fool
Whose right it is , uncensur 'd , to be dull

Such , without wit , are Poets when they please
As without learning they can take Degrees

Leave dang'rous truths to unsuccessful Satires
And flattery to fulsome Dedicators

Whom , when they praise , the world believes no more
Than when they promise to give scribbling o'er

'T is best sometimes your censure to restrain
And charitably let the dull be vain

Your silence there is better than your spite
For who can rail so long as they can write

Still humming on , their drowsy course they keep
And lash 'd so long , like tops , are lash 'd asleep

False steps but help them to renew the race
As , after stumbling , Jades will mend their pace

What crowds of these , impenitently bold
In sounds and jingling syllables grown old

Still run on Poets , in a raging vein
Ev'n to the dregs and squeezings of the brain

Strain out the last dull droppings of their sense
And rhyme with all the rage of Impotence

Such shameless Bards we have ; and yet't is true
There are as mad abandon 'd Critics too

The bookful blockhead , ignorantly read
With loads of learned lumber in his head

With his own tongue still edifies his ears
And always list'ning to himself appears

All books he reads , and all he reads assails
From Dryden 's Fables down to Durfey 's Tales

With him , most authors steal their works , or buy
Garth did not write his own Dispensary

Name a new Play , and he 's the Poet 's friend
Nay show 'd his faults -- but when would Poets mend

No place so sacred from such fops is barred
Nor is Paul 's church more safe than Paul 's churchyard

Nay , fly to Altars ; there they 'll talk you dead
For Fools rush in where Angels fear to tread

Distrustful sense with modest caution speaks
It still looks home , and short excursions makes

And never shock 'd , and never turn 'd aside
Bursts out , resistless , with a thund'ring tide

But where 's the man , who counsel can bestow
Still pleas 'd to teach , and yet not proud to know

Unbiass 'd , or by favour , or by spite
Not dully prepossess 'd , nor blindly right

Tho ' learn 'd , well-bred ; and tho ' well-bred , sincere
Modestly bold , and humanly severe

Who to a friend his faults can freely show
And gladly praise the merit of a foe

Blest with a taste exact , yet unconfined
A knowledge both of books and human kind

Gen'rous converse ; a soul exempt from pride
And love to praise , with reason on his side

Such once were Critics ; such the happy few
Athens and Rome in better ages knew

The mighty Stagirite first left the shore
Spread all his sails , and durst the deeps explore

He steer 'd securely , and discover 'd far
Led by the light of the Maeonian Star

Poets , a race long unconfin 'd , and free
Still fond and proud of savage liberty

Receiv 'd his laws ; and stood convinc 'd 't was fit
Who conquer 'd Nature , should preside o'er Wit

Horace still charms with graceful negligence
And without method talks us into sense

Will , like a friend , familiarly convey
The truest notions in the easiest way

He , who supreme in judgment , as in wit
Might boldly censure , as he boldly writ

Yet judg 'd with coolness , tho ' he sung with fire
His Precepts teach but what his works inspire

Our Critics take a contrary extreme
They judge with fury , but they write with fle'me

Nor suffers Horace more in wrong Translations
By Wits , than Critics in as wrong Quotations

See Dionysius Homer 's thoughts refine
And call new beauties forth from ev'ry line

Fancy and art in gay Petronius please
The scholar 's learning , with the courtier 's ease

In grave Quintilian 's copious work , we find
The justest rules , and clearest method joined

Thus useful arms in magazines we place
All rang 'd in order , and dispos 'd with grace

But less to please the eye , than arm the hand
Still fit for use , and ready at command

Thee , bold Longinus ! all the Nine inspire
And bless their Critic with a Poet 's fire

An ardent Judge , who zealous in his trust
With warmth gives sentence , yet is always just

Whose own example strengthens all his laws
And is himself that great Sublime he draws

Thus long succeeding Critics justly reigned
Licence repress 'd , and useful laws ordained

Learning and Rome alike in empire grew
And Arts still follow 'd where her Eagles flew

From the same foes , at last , both felt their doom
And the same age saw Learning fall , and Rome

With Tyranny , then Superstition joined
As that the body , this enslav 'd the mind

Much was believ 'd , but little understood
And to be dull was constru 'd to be good

A second deluge Learning thus o'er-run
And the Monks finish 'd what the Goths begun

At length Erasmus , that great injur 'd name
( The glory of the Priesthood , and the shame

Stemm 'd the wild torrent of a barb'rous age
And drove those holy Vandals off the stage

But see ! each Muse , in LEO 'S golden days
Starts from her trance , and trims her wither 'd bays

Rome 's ancient Genius , o'er its ruins spread
Shakes off the dust , and rears his rev'rend head

Then Sculpture and her sister-arts revive
Stones leap 'd to form , and rocks began to live

With sweeter notes each rising Temple rung
A Raphael painted , and a Vida sung

Immortal Vida : on whose honour 'd brow
The Poet 's bays and Critic 's ivy grow

Cremona now shal ever boast thy name
As next in place to Mantua , next in fame

But soon by impious arms from Latium chased
Their ancient bounds the banish 'd Muses passed

Thence Arts o'er all the northern world advance
But Critic-learning flourish 'd most in France

The rules a nation , born to serve , obeys
And Boileau still in right of Horace sways

But we , brave Britons , foreign laws despised
And kept unconquer 'd , and uncivilized

Fierce for the liberties of wit , and bold
We still defy 'd the Romans , as of old

Yet some there were , among the sounder few
Of those who less presum 'd , and better knew

Who durst assert the juster ancient cause
And here restor 'd Wit 's fundamental laws

Such was the Muse , whose rules and practice tell
`` Nature 's chief Master-piece is writing well

Such was Roscommon , not more learn 'd than good
With manners gen'rous as his noble blood

To him the wit of Greece and Rome was known
And ev'ry author 's merit , but his own

Such late was Walsh -- the Muse 's judge and friend
Who justly knew to blame or to commend

To failings mild , but zealous for desert
The clearest head , and the sincerest heart

This humble praise , lamented shade ! receive
This praise at least a grateful Muse may give

The Muse , whose early voice you taught to sing
Prescrib 'd her heights , and prun 'd her tender wing

( Her guide now lost ) no more attempts to rise
But in low numbers short excursions tries

Content , if hence th ' unlearn 'd their wants may view
The learn 'd reflect on what before they knew

Careless of censure , nor too fond of fame
Still pleas 'd to praise , yet not afraid to blame

Averse alike to flatter , or offend
Not free from faults , nor yet too vain to mend

Awake , my ST. JOHN ! leave all meaner things
To low ambition , and the pride of Kings

Let us ( since Life can little more supply
Than just to look about us and to die

Expatiate free o'er all this scene of Man
A mighty maze ! but not without a plan

A Wild , where weeds and flow'rs promiscuous shoot
Or Garden , tempting with forbidden fruit

Together let us beat this ample field
Try what the open , what the covert yield

The latent tracts , the giddy heights , explore
Of all who blindly creep , or sightless soar

Eye Nature 's walks , shoot Folly as it flies
And catch the Manners living as they rise

Laugh where we must , be candid where we can
But vindicate the ways of God to Man

Say first , of God above , or Man below
What can we reason , but from what we know

Of Man , what see we but his station here
From which to reason , or to which refer

Thro ' worlds unnumber 'd tho ' the God be known
'T is ours to trace him only in our own

He , who thro ' vast immensity can pierce
See worlds on worlds compose one universe

Observe how system into system runs
What other planets circle other suns

What vary 'd Being peoples ev'ry star
May tell why Heav'n has made us as we are

But of this frame the bearings , and the ties
The strong connexions , nice dependencies

Gradations just , has thy pervading soul
Look 'd thro ' ? or can a part contain the whole

Is the great chain , that draws all to agree
And drawn supports , upheld by God , or thee

II . Presumptuous Man ! the reason wouldst thou find
Why form 'd so weak , so little , and so blind

First , if thou canst , the harder reason guess
Why form 'd no weaker , blinder , and no less

Ask of thy mother earth , why oaks are made
Taller or stronger than the weeds they shade

Or ask of yonder argent fields above
Why JOVE 'S satellites are less than JOVE

Of Systems possible , if 't is confest
That Wisdom infinite must form the best

Where all must full or not coherent be
And all that rises , rise in due degree

Then , in the scale of reas'ning life , 't is plain
There must be , somewhere , such a rank as Man

And all the question ( wrangle e'er so long
Is only this , if God has plac 'd him wrong

Respecting Man , whatever wrong we call
May , must be right , as relative to all

In human works , tho ' labour 'd on with pain
A thousand movements scarce one purpose gain

In God 's , one single can its end produce
Yet serves to second too some other use

So Man , who here seems principal alone
Perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown

Touches some wheel , or verges to some goal
'T is but a part we see , and not a whole

When the proud steed shall know why Man restrains
His fiery course , or drives him o'er the plains

When the dull Ox , why now he breaks the clod
Is now a victim , and now AEgypt 's God

Then shall Man 's pride and dulness comprehend
His actions ' , passions ' , being 's , use and end

Why doing , suff'ring , check 'd , impell 'd ; and why
This hour a slave , the next a deity

Then say not Man 's imperfect , Heav'n in fault
Say rather , Man 's as perfect as he ought

His knowledge measur 'd to his state and place
His time a moment , and a point his space

If to be perfect in a certain sphere
What matter , soon or late , or here or there

The blest to day is as completely so
As who began a thousand years ago

III . Heav'n from all creatures hides the book of Fate
All but the page prescrib 'd , their present state

From brutes what men , from men what spirits know
Or who could suffer Being here below

The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to-day
Had he thy Reason , would he skip and play

Pleas 'd to the last , he crops the flow'ry food
And licks the hand just rais 'd to shed his blood

Oh blindness to the future ! kindly giv'n
That each may fill the circle mark 'd by Heav'n

Who sees with equal eye , as God of all
A hero perish , or a sparrow fall

Atoms or systems into ruin hurled
And now a bubble burst , and now a world

Hope humbly then : with trembling pinions soar
Wait the great teacher Death ; and God adore

What future bliss , he gives not thee to know
But gives that Hope to be thy blessing now

Hope springs eternal in the human breast
Man never Is , but always To be blest

The soul , uneasy and confin 'd from home
Rests and expatiates in a life to come

Lo , the poor Indian ! whose untutor 'd mind
Sees God in clouds , or hears him in the wind

His soul , proud Science never taught to stray
Far as the solar walk , or milky way

Yet simple Nature to his hope has giv'n
Behind the cloud-topt hill , an humbler heav'n

Some safer world in depth of woods embraced
Some happier island in the watry waste

Where slaves once more their native land behold
No fiends torment , no Christians thirst for gold

To Be , contents his natural desire
He asks no Angel 's wing , no Seraph 's fire

But thinks , admitted to that equal sky
His faithful dog shall bear him company

IV . Go , wiser thou ! and , in thy scale of sense
Weight thy Opinion against Providence

Call imperfection what thou fancy'st such
Say , here he gives too little , there too much

Destroy all Creatures for thy sport or gust
Yet cry , If Man 's unhappy , God 's unjust

If Man alone engross not Heav'n 's high care
Alone made perfect here , immortal there

Snatch from his hand the balance and the rod
Re-judge his justice , be the God of God

In Pride , in reas'ning Pride , our error lies
All quit their sphere , and rush into the skies

Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes
Men would be Angels , Angels would be Gods

Aspiring to be Gods , if Angels fell
Aspiring to be Angels , Men rebel

And who but wishes to invert the laws
Of ORDER , sins against th ' Eternal Cause

V. Ask for what end the heav'nly bodies shine
Earth for whose use ? Pride answers , `` 'T is for mine

For me kind Nature wakes her genial Pow ' r
Suckles each herb , and spreads out ev'ry flow ' r

Annual for me , the grape , the rose renew
The juice nectareous , and the balmy dew

For me , the mine a thousand treasures brings
For me , health gushes from a thousand springs

Seas roll to waft me , suns to light me rise
My foot-stool earth , my canopy the skies

But errs not Nature from his gracious end
From burning suns when livid deaths descend

When earthquakes swallow , or when tempests sweep
Towns to one grave , whole nations to the deep

`` No , ( 't is reply 'd ) the first Almighty Cause
Acts not by partial , but by gen'ral laws

Th ' exceptions few ; some change since all began
And what created perfect ? '' -- Why then Man

If the great end be human Happiness
Then Nature deviates ; and can Man do less

As much that end a constant course requires
Of show'rs and sun-shine , as of Man 's desires

As much eternal springs and cloudless skies
As Men for ever temp'rate , calm , and wise

If plagues or earthquakes break not Heav'n 's design
Why then a Borgia , or a Catiline

Who knows but he , whose hand the lightning forms
Who heaves old Ocean , and who wings the storms

Pours fierce Ambition in a Caesar 's mind
Or turns young Ammon loose to scourge mankind

From pride , from pride , our very reas'ning springs
Account for moral , as for nat'ral things

Why charge we Heav'n in those , in these acquit
In both , to reason right is to submit

Better for Us , perhaps , it might appear
Were there all harmony , all virtue here

That never air or ocean felt the wind
That never passion discompos 'd the mind

But ALL subsists by elemental strife
And Passions are the elements of Life

The gen'ral ORDER , since the whole began
Is kept in Nature , and is kept in Man

VI . What would this Man ? Now upward will he soar
And little less than Angel , would be more

Now looking downwards , just as griev 'd appears
To want the strength of bulls , the fur of bears

Made for his use all creatures if he call
Say what their use , had he the pow'rs of all

Nature to these , without profusion , kind
The proper organs , proper pow'rs assigned

Each seeming want compensated of course
Here with degrees of swiftness , there of force

All in exact proportion to the state
Nothing to add , and nothing to abate

Each beast , each insect , happy in its own
Is Heav'n unkind to Man , and Man alone

Shall he alone , whom rational we call
Be pleas 'd with nothing , if not bless 'd with all

The bliss of Man ( could Pride that blessing find
Is not to act or think beyond mankind

No pow'rs of body or of soul to share
But what his nature and his state can bear

Why has not Man a microscopic eye
For this plain reason , Man is not a Fly

Say what the use , were finer optics giv'n
T ' inspect a mite , not comprehend the heav'n

Or touch , if tremblingly alive all o'er
To smart and agonize at every pore

Or quick effluvia darting thro ' the brain
Die of a rose in aromatic pain

If Nature thunder 'd in his op'ning ears
And stunn 'd him with the music of the spheres

How would he wish that Heav'n had left him still
The whisp'ring Zephyr , and the purling rill

Who finds not Providence all good and wise
Alike in what it gives , and what denies

VII . Far as Creation 's ample range extends
The scale of sensual , mental pow'rs ascends

Mark how it mounts , to Man 's imperial race
From the green myriads in the peopled grass

What modes of sight betwixt each wide extreme
The mole 's dim curtain , and the lynx 's beam

Of smell , the headlong lioness between
And hound sagacious on the tainted green

Of hearing , from the life that fills the Flood
To that which warbles thro ' the vernal wood

The spider 's touch , how exquisitely fine
Feels at each thread , and lives along the line

In the nice bee , what sense so subtly true
From pois'nous herbs extracts the healing dew

How Instinct varies in the grov'lling swine
Compar 'd , half-reas'ning elephant , with thine

'Twixt that , and Reason , what a nice barrier
For ever sep'rate , yet for ever near

Remembrance and Reflection how allyed
What thin partitions Sense from Thought divide

And Middle natures , how they long to join
Yet never pass th ' insuperable line

Without this just gradation , could they be
Subjected , these to those , or all to thee

The pow'rs of all subdu 'd by thee alone
Is not thy Reason all these pow'rs in one

VIII . See , thro ' this air , this ocean , and this earth
All matter quick , and bursting into birth

Above , how high , progressive life may go
Around , how wide ! how deep extend below

Vast chain of Being ! which from God began
Natures ethereal , human , angel , man

Beast , bird , fish , insect , what no eye can see
No glass can reach ; from Infinite to thee

From thee to Nothing. -- On superior pow'rs
Were we to press , inferior might on ours

Or in the full creation leave a void
Where , one step broken , the great scale 's destroyed

From Nature 's chain whatever link you strike
Tenth or ten thousandth , breaks the chain alike

And , if each system in gradation roll
Alike essential to th ' amazing Whole

The least confusion but in one , not all
That system only , but the Whole must fall

Let Earth unbalanc 'd from her orbit fly
Planets and Suns run lawless thro ' the sky

Let ruling Angels from their spheres be hurled
Being on Being wreck 'd , and world on world

Heav'n 's whole foundations to their centre nod
And Nature tremble to the throne of God

All this dread ORDER break -- for whom ? for thee
Vile worm ! -- Oh Madness ! Pride ! Impiety

IX . What if the foot , ordain 'd the dust to tread
Or hand , to toil , aspir 'd to be the head

What if the head , the eye , or ear repined
To serve mere engines to the ruling Mind

Just as absurd for any part to claim
To be another , in this gen'ral frame

Just as absurd , to mourn the tasks or pains
The great directing MIND of ALL ordains

All are but parts of one stupendous whole
Whose body Nature is , and God the soul

That , chang 'd thro ' all , and yet in all the same
Great in the earth , as in th ' ethereal frame

Warms in the sun , refreshes in the breeze
Glows in the stars , and blossoms in the trees

Lives thro ' all life , extends thro ' all extent
Spreads undivided , operates unspent

Breathes in our soul , informs our mortal part
As full , as perfect , in a hair as heart

As full , as perfect , in vile Man that mourns
As the rapt Seraph that adores and burns

To him no high , no low , no great , no small
He fills , he bounds , connects , and equals all

X . Cease then , nor ORDER Imperfection name
Our proper bliss depends on what we blame

Know thy own point : This kind , this due degree
Of blindness , weakness , Heav'n bestows on thee

Submit. -- In this , or any other sphere
Secure to be as blest as thou canst bear

Safe in the hand of one disposing Pow ' r
Or in the natal , or the mortal hour

All Nature is but Art , unknown to thee
All Chance , Direction , which thou canst not see

All Discord , Harmony not understood
All partial Evil , universal Good

And , spite of Pride , in erring Reason 's spite
One truth is clear , WHATEVER IS , IS RIGHT

P. shut , shut the door , good John ! fatigu 'd , I said
Tie up the knocker , say I 'm sick , I 'm dead

The Dog-star rages ! nay't is past a doubt
All Bedlam , or Parnassus , is let out

Fire in each eye , and papers in each hand
They rave , recite , and madden round the land

What walls can guard me , or what shade can hide
They pierce my thickets , thro ' my Grot they glide

By land , by water , they renew the charge
They stop the chariot , and they board the barge

No place is sacred , not the Church is free
Ev'n Sunday shines no Sabbath-day to me

Then from the Mint walks forth the Man of rhyme
Happy to catch me just at Dinner-time

Is there a Parson , much bemus 'd in beer
A maudlin Poetess , a rhyming Peer

A Clerk , foredoom 'd his father 's soul to cross
Who pens a Stanza , when he should _engross_

Is there , who , lock 'd from ink and paper , scrawls
With desp'rate charcoal round his darken 'd walls

All fly to TWIT'NAM , and in humble strain
Apply to me , to keep them mad or vain

Arthur , whose giddy son neglects the Laws
Imputes to me and my damn 'd works the cause

Poor Cornus sees his frantic wife elope
And curses Wit , and Poetry , and Pope

Friend to my Life ! ( which did not you prolong
The world had wanted many an idle song

What _Drop_ or _Nostrum_ can this plague remove
Or which must end me , a Fool 's wrath or love

A dire dilemma ! either way I 'm sped
If foes , they write , if friends , they read me dead

Seiz 'd and tied down to judge , how wretched I
Who ca n't be silent , and who will not lie

To laugh , were want of goodness and of grace
And to be grave , exceeds all Pow ' r of face

I sit with sad civility , I read
With honest anguish , and an aching head

And drop at last , but in unwilling ears
This saving counsel , `` Keep your piece nine years

`` Nine years ! '' cries he , who high in Drury-lane
Lull 'd by soft Zephyrs thro ' the broken pane

Rhymes ere he wakes , and prints before _Term_ ends
Oblig 'd by hunger , and request of friends

`` The piece , you think , is incorrect ? why , take it
I 'm all submission , what you 'd have it , make it

Three things another 's modest wishes bound
My Friendship , and a Prologue , and ten pound

Pitholeon sends to me : `` You know his Grace
I want a Patron ; ask him for a Place

`` Pitholeon libell 'd me , '' -- '' but here 's a letter
Informs you , Sir , 't was when he knew no better

Dare you refuse him ? Curll invites to dine
`` He 'll write a _Journal_ , or he 'll turn Divine

Bless me ! a packet. -- '' 'T is a stranger sues
A Virgin Tragedy , an Orphan Muse

If I dislike it , `` Furies , death and rage
If I approve , `` Commend it to the Stage

There ( thank my stars ) my whole Commission ends
The Play'rs and I are , luckily , no friends

Fir 'd that the house reject him , `` 'Sdeath I 'll print it
And shame the fools -- Your Int'rest , Sir , with Lintot

'Lintot , dull rogue ! will think your price too much
`` Not , Sir , if you revise it , and retouch

All my demurs but double his Attacks
At last he whispers , `` Do ; and we go snacks

Glad of a quarrel , straight I clap the door
Sir , let me see your works and you no more

'T is sung , when Midas ' Ears began to spring
( Midas , a sacred person and a king

His very Minister who spy 'd them first
( Some say his Queen ) was forc 'd to speak , or burst

And is not mine , my friend , a sorer case
When ev'ry coxcomb perks them in my face

A . Good friend , forbear ! you deal in dang'rous things
I 'd never name Queens , Ministers , or Kings

Keep close to Ears , and those let asses prick
'T is nothing -- P. Nothing ? if they bite and kick

Out with it , DUNCIAD ! let the secret pass
That secret to each fool , that he 's an Ass

The truth once told ( and wherefore should we lie
The Queen of Midas slept , and so may I

You think this cruel ? take it for a rule
No creature smarts so little as a fool

Let peals of laughter , Codrus ! round thee break
Thou unconcern 'd canst hear the mighty crack

Pit , Box , and gall'ry in convulsions hurled
Thou stand'st unshook amidst a bursting world

Who shames a Scribbler ? break one cobweb thro
He spins the slight , self-pleasing thread anew

Destroy his fib or sophistry , in vain
The creature 's at his dirty work again

Thron 'd in the centre of his thin designs
Proud of a vast extent of flimsy lines

Whom have I hurt ? has Poet yet , or Peer
Lost the arch 'd eye-brow , or Parnassian sneer

Does not one table Bavius still admit
Still to one Bishop Philips seem a wit

Still Sappho -- A . Hold ! for God 's sake -- you 'll offend
No Names ! -- be calm ! -- learn prudence of a friend

I too could write , and I am twice as tall
But foes like these -- P. One Flatt'rer 's worse than all

Of all mad creatures , if the learn 'd are right
It is the slaver kills , and not the bite

A fool quite angry is quite innocent
Alas ! 't is ten times worse when they _repent_

One dedicates in high heroic prose
And ridicules beyond a hundred foes

One from all Grubstreet will my fame defend
And more abusive , calls himself my friend

This prints my _Letters_ , that expects a bribe
And others roar aloud , `` Subscribe , subscribe

There are , who to my person pay their court
I cough like _Horace_ , and , tho ' lean , am short

_Ammon's_ great son one shoulder had too high
Such _Ovid's_ nose , and `` Sir ! you have an Eye

Go on , obliging creatures , make me see
All that disgrac 'd my Betters , met in me

Say for my comfort , languishing in bed
`` Just so immortal _Maro_ held his head

And when I die , be sure you let me know
Great _Homer_ died three thousand years ago

Why did I write ? what sin to me unknown
Dipt me in ink , my parents ' , or my own

As yet a child , nor yet a fool to fame
I lisp 'd in numbers , for the numbers came

I left no calling for this idle trade
No duty broke , no father disobeyed

The Muse but serv 'd to ease some friend , not Wife
To help me thro ' this long disease , my Life

To second , ARBUTHNOT ! thy Art and Care
And teach the Being you preserv 'd , to bear

But why then publish ? _Granville_ the polite
And knowing _Walsh_ , would tell me I could write

Well-natur 'd _Garth_ inflam 'd with early praise
And _Congreve_ lov 'd , and _Swift_ endur 'd my lays

The courtly _Talbot , Somers , Sheffield_ , read
Ev'n mitred _Rochester_ would nod the head

And _St . John's_ self ( great _Dryden's_ friends before
With open arms receiv 'd one Poet more

Happy my studies , when by these approved
Happier their author , when by these beloved

From these the world will judge of men and books
Not from the _Burnets , Oldmixons_ , and _Cookes_

Soft were my numbers ; who could take offence
While pure Description held the place of Sense

Like gentle _Fanny's_ was my flow'ry theme
A painted mistress , or a purling stream

Yet then did _Gildon_ draw his venal quill
I wish 'd the man a dinner , and sat still

Yet then did _Dennis_ rave in furious fret
I never answer 'd , -- I was not in debt

If want provok 'd , or madness made them print
I wag 'd no war with _Bedlam_ or the _Mint_

Did some more sober Critic come abroad
If wrong , I smil 'd ; if right , I kiss 'd the rod

Pains , reading , study , are their just pretence
And all they want is spirit , taste , and sense

Commas and points they set exactly right
And 'twere a sin to rob them of their mite

Yet ne'er one sprig of laurel grac 'd these ribalds
From slashing _Bentley_ down to pidling _Tibalds_

Each wight , who reads not , and but scans and spells
Each Word-catcher , that lives on syllables

Ev'n such small Critics some regard may claim
Preserv 'd in _Milton's_ or in _Shakespeare's_ name

Pretty ! in amber to observe the forms
Of hairs , or straws , or dirt , or grubs , or worms

The things , we know , are neither rich nor rare
But wonder how the devil they got there

Were others angry : I excus 'd them too
Well might they rage , I gave them but their due

A man 's true merit 't is not hard to find
But each man 's secret standard in his mind

That Casting-weight pride adds to emptiness
This , who can gratify ? for who can _guess

The Bard whom pilfer 'd Pastorals renown
Who turns a Persian tale for half a Crown

Just writes to make his barrenness appear
And strains , from hard-bound brains , eight lines a year

He , who still wanting , tho ' he lives on theft
Steals much , spends little , yet has nothing left

And He , who now to sense , now nonsense leaning
Means not , but blunders round about a meaning

And He , whose fustian 's so sublimely bad
It is not Poetry , but prose run mad

All these , my modest Satire bade _translate_
And own 'd that nine such Poets made a _Tate_

How did they fume , and stamp , and roar , and chafe
And swear , not ADDISON himself was safe

Peace to all such ! but were there One whose fires
True Genius kindles , and fair Fame inspires

Blest with each talent and each art to please
And born to write , converse , and live with ease

Should such a man , too fond to rule alone
Bear , like the Turk , no brother near the throne

View him with scornful , yet with jealous eyes
And hate for arts that caus 'd himself to rise

Damn with faint praise , assent with civil leer
And without sneering , teach the rest to sneer

Willing to wound , and yet afraid to strike
Just hint a fault , and hesitate dislike

Alike reserv 'd to blame , or to commend
A tim'rous foe , and a suspicious friend

Dreading ev'n fools , by Flatterers besieged
And so obliging , that he ne'er obliged

Like _Cato_ , give his little Senate laws
And sit attentive to his own applause

While Wits and Templars ev'ry sentence raise
And wonder with a foolish face of praise

Who but must laugh , if such a man there be
Who would not weep , if Atticus were he

What tho ' my Name stood rubric on the walls
Or plaister 'd posts , with claps , in capitals

Or smoking forth , a hundred hawkers ' load
On wings of winds came flying all abroad

I sought no homage from the Race that write
I kept , like Asian Monarchs , from their sight

Poems I heeded ( now be-rhym 'd so long
No more than thou , great George ! a birth-day song

I ne'er with wits or witlings pass 'd my days
To spread about the itch of verse and praise

Nor like a puppy , daggled thro ' the town
To fetch and carry sing-song up and down

Nor at Rehearsals sweat , and mouth 'd , and cryed
With handkerchief and orange at my side

But sick of fops , and poetry , and prate
To Bufo left the whole Castalian state

Proud as Apollo on his forked hill
Sat full-blown Bufo , puff 'd by ev'ry quill

Fed with soft Dedication all day long
Horace and he went hand in hand in song

His Library ( where busts of Poets dead
And a true Pindar stood without a head

Receiv 'd of wits an undistinguish 'd race
Who first his judgment ask 'd , and then a place

Much they extoll 'd his pictures , much his seat
And flatter 'd ev'ry day , and some days eat

Till grown more frugal in his riper days
He paid some bards with port , and some with praise

To some a dry rehearsal saw assigned
And others ( harder still ) he paid in kind

_Dryden_ alone ( what wonder ? ) came not nigh
_Dryden_ alone escap 'd this judging eye

But still the _Great_ have kindness in reserve
He help 'd to bury whom he help 'd to starve

May some choice patron bless each gray goose quill
May ev'ry _Bavius_ have his _Bufo_ still

So , when a Statesman wants a day 's defence
Or Envy holds a whole week 's war with Sense

Or simple pride for flatt'ry makes demands
May dunce by dunce be whistled off my hands

Blest be the _Great ! _ for those they take away
And those they left me ; for they left me Gay

Left me to see neglected Genius bloom
Neglected die , and tell it on his tomb

Of all thy blameless life the sole return
My Verse , and Queenb'ry weeping o'er thy urn

Oh let me live my own , and die so too
( To live and die is all I have to do

Maintain a Poet 's dignity and ease
And see what friends , and read what books I please

Above a Patron , tho ' I condescend
Sometimes to call a minister my friend

I was not born for Courts or great affairs
I pay my debts , believe , and say my pray'rs

Can sleep without a Poem in my head
Nor know , if _Dennis_ be alive or dead

Why am I ask 'd what next shall see the light
Heav'ns ! was I born for nothing but to write

Has Life no joys for me ? or , ( to be grave
Have I no friend to serve , no soul to save

`` I found him close with _Swift_ '' -- 'Indeed ? no doubt
( Cries prating _Balbus_ ) 'something will come out

'T is all in vain , deny it as I will
'No , such a Genius never can lie still

And then for mine obligingly mistakes
The first Lampoon Sir _Will_ , or _Bubo_ makes

Poor guiltless I ! and can I choose but smile
When ev'ry Coxcomb knows me by my _Style_

Curst be the verse , how well soe'er it flow
That tends to make one worthy man my foe

Give Virtue scandal , Innocence a fear
Or from the soft-eyed Virgin steal a tear

But he who hurts a harmless neighbour 's peace
Insults fall'n worth , or Beauty in distress

Who loves a Lie , lame slander helps about
Who writes a Libel , or who copies out

That Fop , whose pride affects a patron 's name
Yet absent , wounds an author 's honest fame

Who can _your_ merit _selfishly_ approve
And show the _sense_ of it without the _love_

Who has the vanity to call you friend
Yet wants the honour , injur 'd , to defend

Who tells whate'er you think , whate'er you say
And , if he lie not , must at least betray

Who to the _Dean_ , and _silver bell_ can swear
And sees at _Canons_ what was never there

Who reads , but with a lust to misapply
Make Satire a Lampoon , and Fiction , Lie

A lash like mine no honest man shall dread
But all such babbling blockheads in his stead

Let _Sporus_ tremble -- A . What ? that thing of silk
_Sporus_ , that mere white curd of Ass 's milk

Satire or sense , alas ! can _Sporus_ feel
Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel

P. Yet let me flap this bug with gilded wings
This painted child of dirt , that stinks and stings

Whose buzz the witty and the fair annoys
Yet wit ne'er tastes , and beauty ne'er enjoys

So well-bred spaniels civilly delight
In mumbling of the game they dare not bite

Eternal smiles his emptiness betray
As shallow streams run dimpling all the way

Whether in florid impotence he speaks
And , as the prompter breathes , the puppet squeaks

Or at the ear of _Eve_ , familiar Toad
Half froth , half venom , spits himself abroad

In puns , or politics , or tales , or lies
Or spite , or smut , or rhymes , or blasphemies

His wit all see-saw , between _that_ and _this_
Now high , now low , now master up , now miss

Amphibious thing ! that acting either part
The trifling head or the corrupted heart

Fop at the toilet , flatt'rer at the board
Now trips a Lady , and now struts a Lord

_Eve's_ tempter thus the Rabbins have exprest
A Cherub 's face , a reptile all the rest

Beauty that shocks you , parts that none will trust
Wit that can creep , and pride that licks the dust

Not Fortune 's worshipper , nor fashion 's fool
Not Lucre 's madman , nor Ambition 's tool

Not proud , nor servile ; -- be one Poet 's praise
That , if he pleas 'd , he pleas 'd by manly ways

That Flatt'ry , ev'n to Kings , he held a shame
And thought a Lie in verse or prose the same

That not in Fancy 's maze he wander 'd long
But stoop 'd to Truth , and moraliz 'd his song

That not for Fame , but Virtue 's better end
He stood the furious foe , the timid friend

The damning critic , half approving wit
The coxcomb hit , or fearing to be hit

Laugh 'd at the loss of friends he never had
The dull , the proud , the wicked , and the mad

The distant threats of vengeance on his head
The blow unfelt , the tear he never shed

The tale reviv 'd , the lie so oft o'erthrown
Th ' imputed trash , and dulness not his own

The morals blacken 'd when the writings scape
The libell 'd person , and the pictur 'd shape

Abuse , on all he lov 'd , or lov 'd him , spread
A friend in exile , or a father , dead

The whisper , that to greatness still too near
Perhaps , yet vibrates on his SOV'REIGN 'S ear

Welcome for thee , fair _Virtue_ ! all the past
For thee , fair Virtue ! welcome ev'n the _last_

A . But why insult the poor , affront the great
P. A knave 's a knave , to me , in ev'ry state

Alike my scorn , if he succeed or fail
_Sporus_ at court , or _Japhet_ in a jail

A hireling scribbler , or a hireling peer
Knight of the post corrupt , or of the shire

If on a Pillory , or near a Throne
He gain his Prince 's ear , or lose his own

Yet soft by nature , more a dupe than wit
_Sappho_ can tell you how this man was bit

This dreaded Sat'rist _Dennis_ will confess
Foe to his pride , but friend to his distress

So humble , he has knock 'd at _Tibbald's_ door
Has drunk with _Cibber_ , nay has rhym 'd for _Moore_

Full ten years slander 'd , did he once reply
Three thousand suns went down on _Welsted's_ lie

To please a Mistress one aspers 'd his life
He lash 'd him not , but let her be his wife

Let _Budgel_ charge low _Grubstreet_ on his quill
And write whate'er he pleas 'd , except his Will

Let the two _Curlls_ of Town and Court , abuse
His father , mother , body , soul , and muse

Yet why ? that Father held it for a rule
It was a sin to call our neighbour fool

That harmless Mother thought no wife a whore
Hear this , and spare his family , _James Moore

Unspotted names , and memorable long
If there be force in Virtue , or in Song

Of gentle blood ( part shed in Honour 's cause
While yet in _Britain_ Honour had applause

Each parent sprung -- A . What fortune , pray ? -- P . Their own
And better got , than _Bestia's_ from the throne

Born to no Pride , inheriting no Strife
Nor marrying Discord in a noble wife

Stranger to civil and religious rage
The good man walk 'd innoxious thro ' his age

Nor Courts he saw , no suits would ever try
Nor dar 'd an Oath , nor hazarded a Lie

Un-learn 'd , he knew no schoolman 's subtle art
No language , but the language of the heart

By Nature honest , by Experience wise
Healthy by temp'rance , and by exercise

His life , tho ' long , to sickness past unknown
His death was instant , and without a groan

O grant me , thus to live , and thus to die
Who sprung from Kings shall know less joy than I

O Friend ! may each domestic bliss be thine
Be no unpleasing Melancholy mine

Me , let the tender office long engage
To rock the cradle of reposing Age

With lenient arts extend a Mother 's breath
Make Languor smile , and smooth the bed of Death

Explore the thought , explain the asking eye
And keep a while one parent from the sky

On cares like these if length of days attend
May Heav'n , to bless those days , preserve my friend

Preserve him social , cheerful , and serene
And just as rich as when he serv 'd a QUEEN

A . Whether that blessing be deny 'd or giv'n
Thus far was right , the rest belongs to Heav'n

In vain , in vain -- the all-composing Hour
Resistless falls : the Muse obeys the Pow ' r

She comes ! she comes ! the sable Throne behold
Of _Night_ primaeval and of _Chaos_ old

Before her , _Fancy's_ gilded clouds decay
And all its varying Rain-bows die away

_Wit_ shoots in vain its momentary fires
The meteor drops , and in a flash expires

As one by one , at dread Medea 's strain
The sick'ning stars fade off th ' ethereal plain

As Argus ' eyes by Hermes ' wand opprest
Clos 'd one by one to everlasting rest

Thus at her felt approach , and secret might
_Art_ after _Art_ goes out , and all is Night

See skulking _Truth_ to her old cavern fled
Mountains of Casuistry heap 'd o'er her head

_Philosophy_ , that lean 'd on Heav'n before
Shrinks to her second cause , and is no more

_Physic_ of _Metaphysic_ begs defence
And _Metaphysic_ calls for aid on _Sense_

See _Mystery_ to _Mathematics_ fly
In vain ! they gaze , turn giddy , rave , and die

_Religion_ blushing veils her sacred fires
And unawares _Morality_ expires

For _public_ Flame , nor _private_ , dares to shine
Nor _human_ Spark is left , nor Glimpse _divine_

Lo ! thy dread Empire , CHAOS ! is restored
Light dies before thy uncreating word

Thy hand , great Anarch ! lets the curtain fall
And universal Darkness buries All

First in these fields I try the sylvan strains
Nor blush to sport on Windsor 's blissful plains

Fair Thames , flow gently from thy sacred spring
While on thy banks Sicilian Muses sing

Let vernal airs through trembling osiers play
And Albion 's cliffs resound the rural lay

You that , too wise for pride , too good for power
Enjoy the glory to be great no more

And , carrying with you all the world can boast
To all the world illustriously are lost

Oh , let my Muse her slender reed inspire
Till in your native shades you tune the lyre

So when the nightingale to rest removes
The thrush may chant to the forsaken groves

But , charm 'd to silence , listens while she sings
And all the aerial audience clap their wings

Soon as the flocks shook off the nightly dews
Two swains , whom Love kept wakeful , and the Muse

Pour 'd o'er the whitening vale their fleecy care
Fresh as the morn , and as the season fair

The dawn now blushing on the mountain 's side
Thus Daphnis spoke , and Strephou thus replied

Hear how the birds , on every bloomy spray
With joyous music wake the dawning day

Why sit we mute when early linnets sing
When warbling Philomel salutes the spring

Why sit we sad , when Phosphor ] shines so clear
And lavish Nature paints the purple year

Sing then , and Damon shall attend the strain
While yon slow oxen turn the furrow 'd plain

Here the bright crocus and blue violet glow
Here western winds on breathing roses blow

I 'll stake yon lamb , that near the fountain plays
And from the brink his dancing shade surveys

And I this bowl , where wanton ivy twines
And swelling clusters bend the curling vines

Four Figures rising from the work appear
The various Seasons of the rolling year

And what is that , which binds the radiant sky
Where twelve fair signs in beauteous order lie

Then sing by turns , by turns the Muses sing
Now hawthorns blossom , now the daisies spring

Now leaves the trees , and flowers adorn the ground
Begin , the vales shall every note rebound

Inspire me , Phoebus , in my Delia 's praise
With Waller 's strains , or Granville 's moving lays

A milk-white bull shall at your altars stand
That threats a fight , and spurns the rising sand

O Love ! for Sylvia let me gain the prize
And make my tongue victorious as her eyes

No lambs or sheep for victims I 'll impart
Thy victim , Love , shall be the shepherd 's heart

Me gentle Delia beckons from the plain
Then hid in shades , eludes her eager swain

But feigns a laugh , to see me search around
And by that laugh the willing fair is found

The sprightly Sylvia trips along the green
She runs , but hopes she does not run unseen

While a kind glance at her pursuer flies
How much at variance are her feet and eyes

O'er golden sands let rich Pactolus flow
And trees weep amber on the banks of Po

Blest Thames 's shores the brightest beauties yield
Feed here , my lambs , I 'll seek no distant field

Celestial Venus haunts Idalia 's groves
Diana Cynthus , Ceres Hybla loves

If Windsor-shades delight the matchless maid
Cynthus and Hybla yield to Windsor-shade

All nature mourns , the skies relent in showers
Hush 'd are the birds , and closed the drooping flowers

If Delia smile , the flowers begin to spring
The skies to brighten , and the birds to sing

All nature laughs , the groves are fresh and fair
The sun 's mild lustre warms the vital air

If Sylvia smiles , new glories gild the shore
And vanquish 'd Nature seems to charm no more

In spring the fields , in autumn hills I love
At morn the plains , at noon the shady grove

But Delia always ; absent from her sight
Nor plains at morn , nor groves at noon delight

Sylvia 's like autumn ripe , yet mild as May
More bright than noon , yet fresh as early day

Even spring displeases , when she shines not here
But , blest with her , 't is spring throughout the year

Say , Daphnis , say , in what glad soil appears
A wondrous tree ] that sacred monarchs bears

Tell me but this , and I 'll disclaim the prize
And give the conquest to thy Sylvia 's eyes

Nay , tell me first , in what more happy fields
The thistle ] springs , to which the lily ] yields

And then a nobler prize I will resign
For Sylvia , charming Sylvia shall be thine

Cease to contend , for , Daphnis , I decree
The bowl to Strephon , and the lamb to thee

Blest swains , whose nymphs in every grace excel
Blest nymphs , whose swains those graces sing so well

Now rise , and haste to yonder woodbine bowers
A soft retreat from sudden vernal showers

The turf with rural dainties shall be crowned
While opening blooms diffuse their sweets around

For see ! the gath'ring flocks to shelter tend
And from the Pleiads fruitful showers descend

A shepherd 's boy ( he seeks no better name
Led forth his flocks along the silver Thame

Where dancing sunbeams on the waters played
And verdant alders form 'd a quivering shade

Soft as he mourn 'd , the streams forgot to flow
The flocks around a dumb compassion show

The Naiads wept in every watery bower
And Jove consented in a silent shower

Accept , O Garth ] the Muse 's early lays
That adds this wreath of ivy to thy bays

Hear what from love unpractised hearts endure
From love , the sole disease thou canst not cure

Ye shady beeches , and ye cooling streams
Defence from Phoebus ' , not from Cupid 's beams

To you I mourn , nor to the deaf I sing
'The woods shall answer , and their echo ring . ' ]

The hills and rocks attend my doleful lay
Why art thou prouder and more hard than they

The bleating sheep with my complaints agree
They parch 'd with heat , and I inflamed by thee

The sultry Sirius burns the thirsty plains
While in thy heart eternal winter reigns

Where stray ye , Muses , in what lawn or grove
While your Alexis pines in hopeless love

In those fair fields where sacred Isis glides
Or else where Cam his winding vales divides

As in the crystal spring I view my face
Fresh rising blushes paint the watery glass

But since those graces please thy eyes no more
I shun the fountains which I sought before

Once I was skill 'd in every herb that grew
And every plant that drinks the morning dew

Ah , wretched shepherd , what avails thy art
To cure thy lambs , but not to heal thy heart

Let other swains attend the rural care
Feed fairer flocks , or richer fleeces shear

But nigh yon mountain let me tune my lays
Embrace my love , and bind my brows with bays

That flute is mine which Colin 's tuneful breath
Inspired when living , and bequeath 'd in death

He said , 'Alexis , take this pipe -- the same
That taught the groves my Rosalinda 's name

But now the reeds shall hang on yonder tree
For ever silent , since despised by thee

Oh ! were I made by some transforming power
The captive bird that sings within thy bower

Then might my voice thy listening ears employ
And I those kisses he receives , enjoy

And yet my numbers please the rural throng
Rough Satyrs dance , and Pan applauds the song

The Nymphs , forsaking every cave and spring
Their early fruit , and milk-white turtles bring

Each amorous nymph prefers her gifts in vain
On you their gifts are all bestow 'd again

For you the swains the fairest flowers design
And in one garland all their beauties join

Accept the wreath which you deserve alone
In whom all beauties are comprised in one

See what delights in sylvan scenes appear
Descending gods have found Elysium here

In woods bright Venus with Adonis strayed
And chaste Diana haunts the forest shade

Come , lovely nymph , and bless the silent hours
When swains from shearing seek their nightly bowers

When weary reapers quit the sultry field
And crown 'd with corn their thanks to Ceres yield

This harmless grove no lurking viper hides
But in my breast the serpent love abides

Here bees from blossoms sip the rosy dew
But your Alexis knows no sweets but you

Oh , deign to visit our forsaken seats
The mossy fountains , and the green retreats

Where'er you walk , cool gales shall fan the glade
Trees , where you sit , shall crowd into a shade

Where'er you tread , the blushing flowers shall rise
And all things flourish where you turn your eyes

Oh , how I long with you to pass my days
Invoke the Muses , and resound your praise

Your praise the birds shall chant in every grove
And winds shall waft it to the Powers above

But would you sing , and rival Orpheus ' strain
The wondering forests soon should dance again

The moving mountains hear the powerful call
And headlong streams hang listening in their fall

But see , the shepherds shun the noonday heat
The lowing herds to murmuring brooks retreat

To closer shades the panting flocks remove
Ye gods ! and is there no relief for love

But soon the sun with milder rays descends
To the cool ocean , where his journey ends

On me Love 's fiercer flames for ever prey
By night he scorches , as he burns by day

Beneath the shade a spreading beech displays
Hylas and AEgon sung their rural lays

This mourn 'd a faithless , that an absent love
And Delia 's name and Doris ' fill 'd the grove

Ye Mantuan nymphs , your sacred succour bring
Hylas and AEgon 's rural lays I sing

Thou , whom the Nine with Plautus ' wit inspire
The art of Terence , and Menander 's fire

Whose sense instructs us , and whose humour charms
Whose judgment sways us , and whose spirit warms

Oh , skill 'd in Nature ! see the hearts of swains
Their artless passions , and their tender pains

Now setting Phoebus shone serenely bright
And fleecy clouds were streak 'd with purple light

When tuneful Hylas , with melodious moan
Taught rocks to weep , and made the mountains groan

Go , gentle gales , and bear my sighs away
To Delia 's ear the tender notes convey

As some sad turtle his lost love deplores
And with deep murmurs fills the sounding shores

Thus , far from Delia , to the winds I mourn
Alike unheard , unpitied , and forlorn

Go , gentle gales , and bear my sighs along
For her , the feather 'd choirs neglect their song

For her , the limes their pleasing shades deny
For her , the lilies hang their heads and die

Ye flowers that droop , forsaken by the spring
Ye birds that , left by summer , cease to sing

Ye trees that fade when autumn-heats remove
Say , is not absence death to those who love

Go , gentle gales , and bear my sighs away
Cursed be the fields that cause my Delia 's stay

Fade every blossom , wither every tree
Die every flower , and perish all but she

What have I said ? Where'er my Delia flies
Let spring attend , and sudden flowers arise

Let opening roses knotted oaks adorn
And liquid amber drop from every thorn

Go , gentle gales , and bear my sighs along
The birds shall cease to tune their evening song

The winds to breathe , the waving woods to move
And streams to murmur , ere I cease to love

Not bubbling fountains to the thirsty swain
Not balmy sleep to labourers faint with pain

Not showers to larks , or sunshine to the bee
Are half so charming as thy sight to me

Go , gentle gales , and bear my sighs away
Come , Delia , come ; ah , why this long delay

Through rocks and caves the name of Delia sounds
Delia , each care and echoing rock rebounds

Ye Powers , what pleasing frenzy soothes my mind
Do lovers dream , or is my Delia kind

She comes , my Delia comes ! -- Now cease , my lay
And cease , ye gales , to bear my sighs away

Next AEgon sung , while Windsor groves admired
Rehearse , ye Muses , what yourselves inspired

Resound , ye hills , resound my mournful strain
Of perjured Doris , dying I complain

Here where the mountains , lessening as they rise
Lose the low vales , and steal into the skies

While labouring oxen , spent with toil and heat
In their loose traces from the field retreat

While curling smokes from village-tops are seen
And the fleet shades glide o'er the dusky green

Resound , ye hills , resound my mournful lay
Beneath yon poplar oft we pass 'd the day

Oft on the rind I carved her amorous vows
While she with garlands hung the bending boughs

The garlands fade , the vows are worn away
So dies her love , and so my hopes decay

Resound , ye hills , resound my mournful strain
Now bright Arcturus glads the teeming grain

Now golden fruits on loaded branches shine
And grateful clusters swell with floods of wine

Now blushing berries paint the yellow grove
Just gods ! shall all things yield returns but love

Resound , ye hills , resound my mournful lay
The shepherds cry , 'Thy flocks are left a prey

Ah ! what avails it me , the flocks to keep
Who lost my heart -- while I preserved my sheep

Pan came , and ask 'd , what magic caused my smart
Or what ill eyes malignant glances dart

What eyes but hers , alas , have power to move
And is there magic but what dwells in love

Resound , ye hills , resound my mournful strains
I 'll fly from shepherds , flocks , and flowery plains

From shepherds , flocks , and plains , I may remove
Forsake mankind , and all the world -- but Love

I know thee , Love ! on foreign mountains bred
Wolves gave thee suck , and savage tigers fed

Thou wert from Etna 's burning entrails torn
Got by fierce whirlwinds , and in thunder born

Resound , ye hills , resound my mournful lay
Farewell , ye woods ; adieu , the light of day

One leap from yonder cliff shall end my pains
No more , ye hills , no more resound my strains

Thus sung the shepherds till the approach of night
The skies yet blushing with departing light

When falling dews with spangles deck 'd the glade
And the low sun had lengthen 'd every shade

Thyrsis , the music of that murmuring spring
Is not so mournful as the strains you sing

Nor rivers winding through the vales below
So sweetly warble , or so smoothly flow

Now sleeping flocks on their soft fleeces lie
The moon , serene in glory , mounts the sky

While silent birds forget their tuneful lays
Oh sing of Daphne 's fate , and Daphne 's praise

Behold the groves that shine with silver frost
Their beauty wither 'd , and their verdure lost

Here shall I try the sweet Alexis ' strain
That call 'd the listening Dryads to the plain

Thames heard the numbers as he flow 'd along
And bade his willows learn the moving song

So may kind rains their vital moisture yield
And swell the future harvest of the field

Begin ; this charge the dying Daphne gave
And said , 'Ye shepherds , sing around my grave

Sing , while beside the shaded tomb I mourn
And with fresh bays her rural shrine adorn

Ye gentle Muses , leave your crystal spring
Let nymphs and sylvans cypress garlands bring

Ye weeping Loves , the stream with myrtles hide
And break your bows , as when Adonis died

And with your golden darts , now useless grown
Inscribe a verse on this relenting stone

'Let Nature change , let Heaven and Earth deplore
Fair Daphne 's dead , and Love is now no more

'T is done , and Nature 's various charms decay
See gloomy clouds obscure the cheerful day

Now hung with pearls the dropping trees appear
Their faded honours scatter 'd on her bier

See where , on earth , the flowery glories lie
With her they flourish 'd , and with her they die

Ah , what avail the beauties Nature wore
Fair Daphne 's dead , and Beauty is no more

For her the flocks refuse their verdant food
The thirsty heifers shun the gliding flood

The silver swans her hapless fate bemoan
In notes more sad than when they sing their own

In hollow caves sweet Echo silent lies
Silent , or only to her name replies

Her name with pleasure once she taught the shore
Now Daphne 's dead , and Pleasure is no more

No grateful dews descend from evening skies
Nor morning odours from the flowers arise

No rich perfumes refresh the fruitful field
Nor fragrant herbs their native incense yield

The balmy zephyrs , silent since her death
Lament the ceasing of a sweeter breath

Th ' industrious bees neglect their golden store
Fair Daphne 's dead , and Sweetness is no more

No more the mounting larks , while Daphne sings
Shall , listening in mid air , suspend their wings

No more the birds shall imitate her lays
Or , hush 'd with wonder , hearken from the sprays

No more the streams their murmurs shall forbear
A sweeter music than their own to hear

But tell the reeds , and tell the vocal shore
Fair Daphne 's dead , and Music is no more

Her fate is whisper 'd by the gentle breeze
And told in sighs to all the trembling trees

The trembling trees , in every plain and wood
Her fate remurmur to the silver flood

The silver flood , so lately calm , appears
Swell 'd with new passion , and o'erflows with tears

The winds and trees and floods her death deplore
Daphne , our grief , our glory now no more

But see ! where Daphne wondering mounts on high
Above the clouds , above the starry sky

Eternal beauties grace the shining scene
Fields ever fresh , and groves for ever green

There while you rest in amaranthine bowers
Or from those meads select unfading flowers

Behold us kindly , who your name implore
Daphne , our goddess , and our grief no more

How all things listen , while thy Muse complains
Such silence waits on Philomela 's strains

In some still evening , when the whispering breeze
Pants on the leaves , and dies upon the trees

To thee , bright goddess , oft a lamb shall bleed
If teeming ewes increase my fleecy breed

While plants their shade , or flowers their odours give
Thy name , thy honour , and thy praise shall live

But see , Orion sheds unwholesome dews
Arise , the pines a noxious shade diffuse

Sharp Boreas blows , and Nature feels decay
Time conquers all , and we must Time obey

Adieu , ye vales , ye mountains , streams , and groves
Adieu , ye shepherds , rural lays , and loves

Adieu , my flocks ; farewell , ye sylvan crew
Daphne , farewell ; and all the world , adieu

Ye Nymphs of Solyma ! begin the song
To heavenly themes sublimer strains belong

The mossy fountains , and the sylvan shades
The dreams of Pindus and the Aonian maids

Delight no more -- O Thou my voice inspire
Who touch 'd Isaiah 's hallow 'd lips with fire

Rapt into future times , the bard begun
A virgin shall conceive , a virgin bear a son

From Jesse 's root behold the branch arise
Whose sacred flower with fragrance fills the skies

The ethereal Spirit o'er its leaves shall move
And on its top descends the mystic Dove

Ye Heavens ! from high the dewy nectar pour
And in soft silence shed the kindly shower

The sick and weak the healing plant shall aid
From storms a shelter , and from heat a shade

All crimes shall cease , and ancient fraud shall fail
Returning Justice lift aloft her scale

Peace o'er the world her olive wand extend
And white-robed Innocence from heaven descend

Swift fly the years , and rise the expected morn
Oh spring to light , auspicious Babe , be born

See , Nature hastes her earliest wreaths to bring
With all the incense of the breathing spring

See lofty Lebanon his head advance
See nodding forests on the mountains dance

See spicy clouds from lowly Saron rise
And Carmel 's flowery top perfumes the skies

Hark ! a glad voice the lonely desert cheers
'Prepare the way ! a God , a God appears

' A God , a God ! ' the vocal hills reply
The rocks proclaim the approaching Deity

Lo , Earth receives him from the bending skies
Sink down , ye mountains , and ye valleys , rise

With heads declined , ye cedars , homage pay
Be smooth , ye rocks , ye rapid floods , give way

The Saviour comes ! by ancient bards foretold
Hear him , ye deaf , and all ye blind , behold

He from thick films shall purge the visual ray
And on the sightless eyeball pour the day

'T is he the obstructed paths of sound shall clear
And bid new music charm th ' unfolding ear

The dumb shall sing , the lame his crutch forego
And leap exulting like the bounding roe

No sigh , no murmur the wide world shall hear
From every face he wipes off every tear

In adamantine chains shall Death be bound
And Hell 's grim tyrant feel th ' eternal wound

As the good shepherd tends his fleecy care
Seeks freshest pasture and the purest air

Explores the lost , the wandering sheep directs
By day o'ersees them , and by night protects

The tender lambs he raises in his arms
Feeds from his hand , and in his bosom warms

Thus shall mankind his guardian care engage
The promised Father of the future age

No more shall nation against nation rise
Nor ardent warriors meet with hateful eyes

Nor fields with gleaming steel be cover 'd o'er
The brazen trumpets kindle rage no more

But useless lances into scythes shall bend
And the broad falchion in a ploughshare end

Then palaces shall rise ; the joyful son
Shall finish what his short-lived sire begun

Their vines a shadow to their race shall yield
And the same hand that sow 'd , shall reap the field

The swain in barren deserts with surprise
See lilies spring , and sudden verdure rise

And start , amidst the thirsty wilds , to hear
New falls of water murmuring in his ear

On rifted rocks , the dragons ' late abodes
The green reed trembles , and the bulrush nods

Waste sandy valleys , once perplex 'd with thorn
The spiry fir , and shapely box adorn

To leafless shrubs the flowering palms succeed
And odorous myrtle to the noisome weed

The lambs with wolves shall graze the verdant mead
And boys in flowery bands the tiger lead

The steer and lion at one crib shall meet
And harmless serpents lick the pilgrim 's feet

The smiling infant in his hand shall take
The crested basilisk and speckled snake

Pleased , the green lustre of the scales survey
And with their forky tongue shall innocently play

Rise , crown 'd with light , imperial Salem , rise
Exalt thy towery head , and lift thy eyes

See , a long race thy spacious courts adorn
See future sons , and daughters yet unborn

In crowding ranks on every side arise
Demanding life , impatient for the skies

See barbarous nations at thy gates attend
Walk in thy light and in thy temple bend

See thy bright altars throng 'd with prostrate kings
And heap 'd with products of Sabean springs

For thee Idume 's spicy forests blow
And seeds of gold in Ophir 's mountains glow

See Heaven its sparkling portals wide display
And break upon thee in a flood of day

No more the rising sun shall gild the morn
Nor evening Cynthia fill her silver horn

But lost , dissolved in thy superior rays
One tide of glory , one unclouded blaze

O'erflow thy courts : The Light himself shall shine
Reveal 'd , and God 's eternal day be thine

The seas shall waste , the skies in smoke decay
Rocks fall to dust , and mountains melt away

But fix 'd his word , his saving power remains
Thy realm for ever lasts , thy own MESSIAH reigns

Thy forests , Windsor ! and thy green retreats
At once the Monarch 's and the Muse 's seats

Invite my lays . Be present , sylvan Maids
Unlock your springs , and open all your shades

Granville commands ; your aid , O Muses , bring
What Muse for Granville can refuse to sing

The groves of Eden , vanish 'd now so long
Live in description , and look green in song

These , were my breast inspired with equal flame
Like them in beauty , should be like in fame

Here hills and vales , the woodland and the plain
Here earth and water seem to strive again

Not chaos-like , together crush 'd and bruised
But , as the world , harmoniously confused

Where order in variety we see
And where , though all things differ , all agree

Here waving groves a chequer 'd scene display
And part admit , and part exclude the day

As some coy nymph her lover 's warm address
Nor quite indulges , nor can quite repress

There , interspersed in lawns and opening glades
Thin trees arise that shun each other 's shades

Here in full light the russet plains extend
There , wrapt in clouds the bluish hills ascend

Ev'n the wild heath displays her purple dyes
And 'midst the desert fruitful fields arise

That crown 'd with tufted trees and springing corn
Like verdant isles the sable waste adorn

Let India boast her plants , nor envy we
The weeping amber or the balmy tree

While by our oaks the precious loads are born
And realms commanded which those trees adorn

Not proud Olympus yields a nobler sight
Though gods assembled grace his towering height

Than what more humble mountains offer here
Where , in their blessings , all those gods appear

See Pan with flocks , with fruits Pomona crowned
Here blushing Flora paints the enamell 'd ground

Here Ceres ' gifts in waving prospect stand
And nodding tempt the joyful reaper 's hand

Rich industry sits smiling on the plains
And peace and plenty tell a Stuart reigns

Not thus the land appear 'd in ages past
A dreary desert , and a gloomy waste

To savage beasts and savage laws ] a prey
And kings more furious and severe than they

Who claim 'd the skies , dispeopled air and floods
The lonely lords of empty wilds and woods

Cities laid waste , they storm 'd the dens and caves
( For wiser brutes were backward to be slaves

What could be free , when lawless beasts obeyed
And even the elements a tyrant swayed

In vain kind seasons swell 'd the teeming grain
Soft showers distill 'd , and suns grew warm in vain

The swain with tears his frustrate labour yields
And famish 'd dies amidst his ripen 'd fields

What wonder , then , a beast or subject slain
Were equal crimes in a despotic reign

Both doom 'd alike , for sportive tyrants bled
But while the subject starved , the beast was fed

Proud Nimrod first the bloody chase began
A mighty hunter , and his prey was man

Our haughty Norman boasts that barbarous name
And makes his trembling slaves the royal game

The fields are ravish 'd from the industrious swains
From men their cities , and from gods their fanes

The levell 'd towns with weeds lie cover 'd o'er
The hollow winds through naked temples roar

Round broken columns clasping ivy twined
O'er heaps of ruin stalk 'd the stately hind

The fox obscene to gaping tombs retires
And savage howlings fill the sacred choirs

Awed by his Nobles , by his Commons cursed
The oppressor ruled tyrannic where he durst

Stretch 'd o'er the poor and Church his iron rod
And served alike his vassals and his God

Whom even the Saxon spared , and bloody Dane
The wanton victims of his sport remain

But see , the man who spacious regions gave
A waste for beasts , himself denied a grave

Stretch 'd on the lawn , his second hope survey
At once the chaser , and at once the prey

Lo Rufus , tugging at the deadly dart
Bleeds in the forest like a wounded hart

Succeeding monarchs heard the subjects ' cries
Nor saw displeased the peaceful cottage rise

Then gathering flocks on unknown mountains fed
O'er sandy wilds were yellow harvests spread

The forests wonder 'd at the unusual grain
And secret transport touch 'd the conscious swain

Fair Liberty , Britannia 's goddess , rears
Her cheerful head , and leads the golden years

Ye vigorous swains ! while youth ferments your blood
And purer spirits swell the sprightly flood

Now range the hills , the gameful woods beset
Wind the shrill horn , or spread the waving net

When milder autumn summer 's heat succeeds
And in the new-shorn field the partridge feeds

Before his lord the ready spaniel bounds
Panting with hope , he tries the furrow 'd grounds

But when the tainted gales the game betray
Couch 'd close he lies , and meditates the prey

Secure they trust the unfaithful field beset
Till hovering o'er 'em sweeps the swelling net

Thus ( if small things we may with great compare
When Albion sends her eager sons to war

Some thoughtless town , with ease and plenty blest
Near , and more near , the closing lines invest

Sudden they seize the amazed , defenceless prize
And high in air Britannia 's standard flies

See ! from the brake the whirring pheasant springs
And mounts exulting on triumphant wings

Short is his joy ; he feels the fiery wound
Flutters in blood , and panting beats the ground

Ah ! what avail his glossy , varying dyes
His purple crest , and scarlet-circled eyes

The vivid green his shining plumes unfold
His painted wings , and breast that flames with gold

Nor yet , when moist Arcturus clouds the sky
The woods and fields their pleasing toils deny

To plains with well-breath 'd beagles we repair
And trace the mazes of the circling hare

( Beasts , urged by us , their fellow-beasts pursue
And learn of man each other to undo

With slaughtering gun the unwearied fowler roves
When frosts have whiten 'd all the naked groves

Where doves in flocks the leafless trees o'ershade
And lonely woodcocks haunt the watery glade

He lifts the tube , and levels with his eye
Straight a short thunder breaks the frozen sky

Oft , as in airy rings they skim the heath
The clamorous lapwings feel the leaden death

Oft , as the mounting larks their notes prepare
They fall , and leave their little lives in air

In genial spring , beneath the quivering shade
Where cooling vapours breathe along the mead

The patient fisher takes his silent stand
Intent , his angle trembling in his hand

With looks unmoved , he hopes the scaly breed
And eyes the dancing cork , and bending reed

Our plenteous streams a various race supply
The bright-eyed perch with fins of Tyrian dye

The silver eel , in shining volumes rolled
The yellow carp , in scales bedropp 'd with gold

Swift trouts , diversified with crimson stains
And pikes , the tyrants of the watery plains

Now Cancer glows with Phoebus ' fiery car
The youth rush eager to the sylvan war

Swarm o'er the lawns , the forest walks surround
Rouse the fleet hart , and cheer the opening hound

The impatient courser pants in every vein
And pawing , seems to beat the distant plain

Hills , vales , and floods appear already crossed
And ere he starts , a thousand steps are lost

See the bold youth strain up the threatening steep
Rush through the thickets , down the valleys sweep

Hang o'er their coursers ' heads with eager speed
And earth rolls back beneath the flying steed

Let old Arcadia boast her ample plain
The immortal huntress , and her virgin-train

Nor envy , Windsor ! since thy shades have seen
As bright a goddess , and as chaste a queen

Whose care , like hers , protects the sylvan reign
The earth 's fair light , and empress of the main

Here too , 't is sung , of old Diana strayed
And Cynthus ' top forsook for Windsor shade

Here was she seen o'er airy wastes to rove
Seek the clear spring , or haunt the pathless grove

Here , arm 'd with silver bows , in early dawn
Her buskin 'd virgins traced the dewy lawn

Above the rest a rural nymph was famed
Thy offspring , Thames ! the fair Lodona named

( Lodona 's fate , in long oblivion cast
The Muse shall sing , and what she sings shall last

Scarce could the goddess from her nymph be known
But by the crescent and the golden zone

She scorn 'd the praise of beauty , and the care
A belt her waist , a fillet binds her hair

A painted quiver on her shoulder sounds
And with her dart the flying deer she wounds

It chanced , as eager of the chase , the maid
Beyond the forest 's verdant limits strayed

Pan saw and loved , and , burning with desire
Pursued her flight , her flight increased his fire

Not half so swift the trembling doves can fly
When the fierce eagle cleaves the liquid sky

Not half so swiftly the fierce eagle moves
When through the clouds he drives the trembling doves

As from the god she flew with furious pace
Or as the god , more furious , urged the chase

Now fainting , sinking , pale the nymph appears
Now close behind , his sounding steps she hears

And now his shadow reach 'd her as she run
His shadow lengthen 'd by the setting sun

And now his shorter breath , with sultry air
Pants on her neck , and fans her parting hair

In vain on father Thames she calls for aid
Nor could Diana help her injured maid

Faint , breathless , thus she pray 'd , nor pray 'd in vain
'Ah , Cynthia ! ah -- though banish 'd from thy train

Let me , oh ! let me , to the shades repair
My native shades -- there weep , and murmur there

She said , and melting as in tears she lay
In a soft , silver stream dissolved away

The silver stream her virgin coldness keeps
For ever murmurs , and for ever weeps

Still bears the name the hapless virgin bore
And bathes the forest where she ranged before

In her chaste current oft the goddess laves
And with celestial tears augments the waves

Oft in her glass the musing shepherd spies
The headlong mountains and the downward skies

The watery landscape of the pendent woods
And absent trees that tremble in the floods

In the clear azure gleam the flocks are seen
And floating forests paint the waves with green

Through the fair scene roll slow the lingering streams
Then foaming pour along , and rush into the Thames

Thou , too , great Father of the British floods
With joyful pride survey'st our lofty woods

Where towering oaks their growing honours rear
And future navies on thy shores appear

Not Neptune 's self from all her streams receives
A wealthier tribute , than to thine he gives

No seas so rich , so gay no banks appear
No lake so gentle , and no spring so clear

Nor Po so swells the fabling poet 's lays
While led along the skies his current strays

As thine , which visits Windsor 's famed abodes
To grace the mansion of our earthly gods

Nor all his stars above a lustre show
Like the bright beauties on thy banks below

Where Jove , subdued by mortal passion still
Might change Olympus for a nobler hill

Happy the man whom this bright court approves
His sovereign favours , and his country loves

Happy next him who to these shades retires
Whom Nature charms , and whom the Muse inspires

Whom humbler joys of home-felt quiet please
Successive study , exercise , and ease

He gathers health from herbs the forest yields
And of their fragrant physic spoils the fields

With chemic art exalts the mineral powers
And draws the aromatic souls of flowers

Now marks the course of rolling orbs on high
O'er figured worlds now travels with his eye

Of ancient writ unlocks the learned store
Consults the dead , and lives past ages o'er

Or wandering thoughtful in the silent wood
Attends the duties of the wise and good

To observe a mean , be to himself a friend
To follow nature , and regard his end

Or looks on Heaven with more than mortal eyes
Bids his free soul expatiate in the skies

Amid her kindred stars familiar roam
Survey the region , and confess her home

Such was the life great Scipio once admired
Thus Atticus , and Trumbull thus retired

Ye sacred Nine ! that all my soul possess
Whose raptures fire me , and whose visions bless

Bear me , oh , bear me to sequester 'd scenes
The bowery mazes , and surrounding greens

To Thames 's banks which fragrant breezes fill
Or where ye Muses sport on Cooper 's Hill

( On Cooper 's Hill eternal wreaths shall grow
While lasts the mountain , or while Thames shall flow

I seem through consecrated walks to rove
I hear soft music die along the grove

Led by the sound , I roam from shade to shade
By godlike poets venerable made

Here his first lays majestic Denham sung
There the last numbers flow 'd from Cowley 's tongue

Oh early lost ! what tears the river shed
When the sad pomp along his banks was led

His drooping swans on every note expire
And on his willows hung each Muse 's lyre

Since fate relentless stopp 'd their heavenly voice
No more the forests ring , or groves rejoice

Who now shall charm the shades , where Cowley strung
His living harp , and lofty Denham sung

But hark ! the groves rejoice , the forest rings
Are these revived ? or is it Granville sings

'T is yours , my lord , to bless our soft retreats
And call the Muses to their ancient seats

To paint anew the flowery sylvan scenes
To crown the forest with immortal greens

Make Windsor hills in lofty numbers rise
And lift her turrets nearer to the skies

To sing those honours you deserve to wear
And add new lustre to her silver star

Here noble Surrey felt the sacred rage
Surrey , the Granville of a former age

Matchless his pen , victorious was his lance
Bold in the lists , and graceful in the dance

In the same shades the Cupids tuned his lyre
To the same notes , of love and soft desire

Fair Geraldine , bright object of his vow
Then fill 'd the groves , as heavenly Mira now

Oh , wouldst thou sing what heroes Windsor bore
What kings first breathed upon her winding shore

Or raise old warriors , whose adored remains
In weeping vaults her hallow 'd earth contains

With Edward 's acts adorn the shining page
Stretch his long triumphs down through every age

Draw monarchs chain 'd , and Cressy 's glorious field
The lilies blazing on the regal shield

Then , from her roofs when Verrio 's colours fall
And leave inanimate the naked wall

Still in thy song should vanquish 'd France appear
And bleed for ever under Britain 's spear

Let softer strains ill-fated Henry mourn
And palms eternal flourish round his urn

Here o'er the martyr-king the marble weeps
And , fast beside him , once-fear 'd Edward sleeps

Whom not the extended Albion could contain
From old Belerium to the northern main

The grave unites ; where ev'n the great find rest
And blended lie the oppressor and the oppressed

Make sacred Charles ' tomb for ever known
( Obscure the place , and uninscribed the stone

Oh fact accursed ! what tears has Albion shed
Heavens , what new wounds ! and how her old have bled

She saw her sons with purple deaths expire
Her sacred domes involved in rolling fire

A dreadful series of intestine wars
Inglorious triumphs and dishonest scars

At length great Anna said -- 'Let discord cease
She said , the world obey 'd , and all was peace

In that blest moment , from his oozy bed
Old Father Thames advanced his reverend head

His tresses dropp 'd with dews , and o'er the stream
His shining horns diffused a golden gleam

Graved on his urn appear 'd the moon , that guides
His swelling waters , and alternate tides

The figured streams in waves of silver rolled
And on their banks Augusta rose in gold

Around his throne the sea-born brothers stood
Who swell with tributary urns his flood

First the famed authors of his ancient name
The winding Isis and the fruitful Thame

The Kennet swift , for silver eels renowned
The Loddon slow , with verdant alders crowned

Cole , whose dark streams his flowery islands lave
And chalky Wey , that rolls a milky wave

The blue , transparent Vandalis appears
The gulfy Lee his sedgy tresses rears

And sullen Mole , that hides his diving flood
And silent Darent , stain 'd with Danish blood

High in the midst , upon his urn reclined
( His sea-green mantle waving with the wind

The god appear 'd : he turn 'd his azure eyes
Where Windsor-domes and pompous turrets rise

Then bow 'd and spoke ; the winds forget to roar
And the hush 'd waves glide softly to the shore

Hail , sacred Peace ! hail , long-expected days
That Thames 's glory to the stars shall raise

Though Tiber 's streams immortal Rome behold
Though foaming Hermus swells with tides of gold

From heaven itself though sevenfold Nilus flows
And harvests on a hundred realms bestows

These now no more shall be the Muse 's themes
Lost in my fame , as in the sea their streams

Let Volga 's banks with iron squadrons shine
And groves of lances glitter on the Rhine

Let barbarous Ganges arm a servile train
Be mine the blessings of a peaceful reign

No more my sons shall dye with British blood
Red Iber 's sands , or Ister 's foaming flood

Safe on my shore each unmolested swain
Shall tend the flocks , or reap the bearded grain

The shady empire shall retain no trace
Of war or blood , but in the sylvan chase

The trumpet sleep , while cheerful horns are blown
And arms employ 'd on birds and beasts alone

Behold ! the ascending villas on my side
Project long shadows o'er the crystal tide

Behold ! Augusta 's glittering spires increase
And temples rise , the beauteous works of Peace

I see , I see , where two fair cities bend
Their ample bow , a new Whitehall ascend

There mighty nations shall inquire their doom
The world 's great oracle in times to come

There kings shall sue , and suppliant states be seen
Once more to bend before a British queen

Thy trees , fair Windsor ! now shall leave their woods
And half thy forests rush into the floods

Bear Britain 's thunder , and her cross display
To the bright regions of the rising day

Tempt icy seas , where scarce the waters roll
Where clearer flames glow round the frozen pole

Or under southern skies exalt their sails
Led by new stars , and borne by spicy gales

For me the balm shall bleed , and amber flow
The coral redden , and the ruby glow

The pearly shell its lucid globe infold
And Phoebus warm the ripening ore to gold

The time shall come when , free as seas or wind
Unbounded Thames shall flow for all mankind

Whole nations enter with each swelling tide
And seas but join the regions they divide

Earth 's distant ends our glory shall behold
And the new world launch forth to seek the old

Then ships of uncouth form shall stem the tide
And feather 'd people crowd my wealthy side

And naked youths and painted chiefs admire
Our speech , our colour , and our strange attire

O stretch thy reign , fair Peace ! from shore to shore
Till conquest cease , and slavery be no more

Till the freed Indians in their native groves
Reap their own fruits , and woo their sable loves

Peru once more a race of kings behold
And other Mexicos be roof 'd with gold

Exiled by thee from earth to deepest hell
In brazen bonds , shall barbarous Discord dwell

Gigantic Pride , pale Terror , gloomy Care
And mad Ambition shall attend her there

There purple Vengeance bathed in gore retires
Her weapons blunted , and extinct her fires

There hateful Envy her own snakes shall feel
And Persecution mourn her broken wheel

There Faction roar , Rebellion bite her chain
And gasping Furies thirst for blood in vain

Here cease thy flight , nor with unhallow 'd lays
Touch the fair fame of Albion 's golden days

The thoughts of gods let Granville 's verse recite
And bring the scenes of opening fate to light

My humble Muse , in unambitious strains
Paints the green forests and the flowery plains

Where Peace descending bids her olives spring
And scatters blessings from her dove-like wing

Ev'n I more sweetly pass my careless days
Pleased in the silent shade with empty praise

Enough for me , that to the listening swains
First in these fields I sung the sylvan strains

In a sadly-pleasing strain
Let the warbling lute complain

Let the loud trumpet sound
Till the roofs all around

While in more lengthen 'd notes and slow
The deep , majestic , solemn organs blow

Hark ! the numbers soft and clear
Gently steal upon the ear

Now louder , and yet louder rise
And fill with spreading sounds the skies

Exulting in triumph now swell the bold notes
In broken air , trembling , the wild music floats

The strains decay
And melt away

By Music , minds an equal temper know
Nor swell too high , nor sink too low

If in the breast tumultuous joys arise
Music her soft , assuasive voice applies

Or , when the soul is press 'd with cares
Exalts her in enlivening airs

Warriors she fires with animated sounds
Pours balm into the bleeding lover 's wounds

Melancholy lifts her head
Morpheus rouses from his bed

Sloth unfolds her arms and wakes
Listening Envy drops her snakes

Intestine war no more our passions wage
And giddy factions hear away their rage

But when our country 's cause provokes to arms
How martial music every bosom warms

Transported demigods stood round
And men grew heroes at the sound

Each chief his sevenfold shield displayed
And half unsheath 'd the shining blade

But when through all the infernal bounds
Which flaming Phlegethon surrounds

Love , strong as death , the poet led
To the pale nations of the dead

What sounds were heard
What scenes appeared

Dreadful gleams
Dismal screams

Fires that glow
Shrieks of woe

Sullen moans
Hollow groans

But , hark ! he strikes the golden lyre
And see ! the tortured ghosts respire

Thy stone , O Sisyphus ! stands still
Ixion rests upon his wheel

The Furies sink upon their iron beds
And snakes uncurl 'd hang listening round their heads

'By the streams that ever flow
By the fragrant winds that blow

By those happy souls who dwell
In yellow meads of asphodel

By the hero 's armed shades
Glittering through the gloomy glades

By the youths that died for love
Wandering in the myrtle grove

Restore , restore Eurydice to life
Oh take the husband , or return the wife

And gave him back the fair
Thus song could prevail

A conquest how hard and how glorious
Though fate had fast bound her

But soon , too soon , the lover turns his eyes
Again she falls , again she dies , she dies

How wilt thou now the fatal sisters move
No crime was thine , if 't is no crime to love

Now under hanging mountains
Beside the falls of fountains

Or where Hebrus wanders
Rolling in meanders

All alone
Unheard , unknown

And calls her ghost
For ever , ever , ever lost

Now with Furies surrounded
Despairing , confounded

He trembles , he glows
Amidst Rhodope 's snows

See , wild as the winds , o'er the desert he flies
Hark ! Haemus resounds with the bacchanals ' cries

Yet even in death Eurydice he sung
Eurydice still trembled on his tongue

Eurydice the woods
Eurydice the floods

Music the fiercest grief can charm
And Fate 's severest rage disarm

Music can soften pain to ease
And make despair and madness please

Our joys below it can improve
And antedate the bliss above

This the divine Cecilia found
And to her Maker 's praise confined the sound

Borne on the swelling notes our souls aspire
While solemn airs improve the sacred fire

Ye shades , where sacred truth is sought
Groves , where immortal sages taught

Where heavenly visions Plato fired
And Epicurus ' lay inspired

In vain your guiltless laurels stood
Unspotted long with human blood

War , horrid war , your thoughtful walks invades
And steel now glitters in the Muses ' shades

O heaven-born sisters ! source of art
Who charm the sense , or mend the heart

Who lead fair Virtue 's train along
Moral truth , and mystic song

To what new clime , what distant sky
Forsaken , friendless , shall ye fly

Say , will ye bless the bleak Atlantic shore
Or bid the furious Gaul be rude no more

When Athens sinks by fates unjust
When wild barbarians spurn her dust

Perhaps even Britain 's utmost shore
Shall cease to blush with strangers ' gore

See Arts her savage sons control
And Athens rising near the pole

Till some new tyrant lifts his purple hand
And civil madness tears them from the land

Ye gods ! what justice rules the ball
Freedom and Arts together fall

Fools grant whate'er Ambition craves
And men , once ignorant , are slaves

Oh , cursed effects of civil hate
In every age , in every state

Still , when the lust of tyrant power succeeds
Some Athens perishes , some Tully bleeds

O tyrant Love ! hast thou possessed
The prudent , learn 'd , and virtuous breast

Wisdom and wit in vain reclaim
And arts but soften us to feel thy flame

Love , soft intruder , enters here
But entering learns to be sincere

Marcus with blushes owns he loves
And Brutus tenderly reproves

Oh source of every social tie
United wish , and mutual joy

What various joys on one attend
As son , as father , brother , husband , friend

Whether his hoary sire he spies
While thousand grateful thoughts arise

Or meets his spouse 's fonder eye
Or views his smiling progeny

Hence , guilty joys , distastes , surmises
Hence , false tears , deceits , disguises

Purest love 's unwasting treasure
Constant faith , fair hope , long leisure

Begone , ye critics , and restrain your spite
Codrus writes on , and will for ever write

The heaviest Muse the swiftest course has gone
As clocks run fastest when most lead is on

What though no bees around your cradle flew
Nor on your lips distill 'd the golden dew

Yet have we oft discover 'd in their stead
A swarm of drones that buzz 'd about your head

When you , like Orpheus , strike the warbling lyre
Attentive blocks stand round you and admire

Wit pass 'd through thee no longer is the same
As meat digested takes a different name

But sense must sure thy safest plunder be
Since no reprisals can be made on thee

Thus thou may'st rise , and in thy daring flight
( Though ne'er so weighty ) reach a wondrous height

So , forced from engines , lead itself can fly
And ponderous slugs move nimbly through the sky

Sure Bavius copied Maevius to the full
And Chaerilus taught Codrus to be dull

Therefore , dear friend , at my advice give o'er
This needless labour ; and contend no more

To prove a _dull succession_ to be true
Since 't is enough we find it so in you

Vital spark of heavenly flame
Quit , oh quit this mortal frame

Trembling , hoping , lingering , flying
Oh the pain , the bliss of dying

Cease , fond Nature , cease thy strife
And let me languish into life

Hark ! they whisper ; angels say
'Sister Spirit , come away

What is this absorbs me quite
Steals my senses , shuts my sight

Drowns my spirits , draws my breath
Tell me , my soul , can this be Death

The world recedes ; it disappears
Heaven opens on my eyes ! my ears

Lend , lend your wings ! I mount ! I fly
O Grave ! where is thy victory

What beckoning ghost , along the moonlight shade
Invites my steps , and points to yonder glade

'T is she ! -- but why that bleeding bosom gored
Why dimly gleams the visionary sword

Oh , ever beauteous , ever friendly ! tell
Is it , in heaven , a crime to love too well

To bear too tender , or too firm a heart
To act a lover 's or a Roman 's part

Is there no bright reversion in the sky
For those who greatly think , or bravely die

Why bade ye else , ye Powers ! her soul aspire
Above the vulgar flight of low desire

Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes
The glorious fault of angels and of gods

Thence to their images on earth it flows
And in the breasts of kings and heroes glows

Most souls , 't is true , but peep out once an age
Dull , sullen prisoners in the body 's cage

Dim lights of life , that burn a length of years
Useless , unseen , as lamps in sepulchres

Like Eastern kings a lazy state they keep
And , close confined to their own palace , sleep

From these perhaps ( ere Nature bade her die
Fate snatch 'd her early to the pitying sky

As into air the purer spirits flow
And separate from their kindred dregs below

So flew the soul to its congenial place
Nor left one virtue to redeem her race

But thou , false guardian of a charge too good
Thou , mean deserter of thy brother 's blood

See on these ruby lips the trembling breath
These cheeks , now fading at the blast of death

Cold is that breast which warm 'd the world before
And those love-darting eyes must roll no more

Thus , if Eternal Justice rules the ball
Thus shall your wives , and thus your children fall

On all the line a sudden vengeance waits
And frequent hearses shall besiege your gates

There passengers shall stand , and pointing say
( While the long funerals blacken all the way

'Lo , these were they , whose souls the Furies steeled
And cursed with hearts unknowing how to yield

Thus unlamented pass the proud away
The gaze of fools , and pageant of a day

So perish all , whose breast ne'er learn 'd to glow
For others ' good , or melt at others ' woe

What can atone ( O ever-injured Shade
Thy fate unpitied , and thy rites unpaid

No friend 's complaint , no kind domestic tear
Pleased thy pale ghost , or graced thy mournful bier

By foreign hands thy dying eyes were closed
By foreign hands thy decent limbs composed

By foreign hands thy humble grave adorned
By strangers honour 'd , and by strangers mourned

What , though no friends in sable weeds appear
Grieve for an hour , perhaps , then mourn a year

And bear about the mockery of woe
To midnight dances , and the public show

What , though no weeping loves thy ashes grace
Nor polish 'd marble emulate thy face

What , though no sacred earth allow thee room
Nor hallow 'd dirge be mutter 'd o'er thy tomb

Yet shall thy grave with rising flowers be dressed
And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast

There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow
There the first roses of the year shall blow

While angels with their silver wings o'ershade
The ground , now sacred by thy relics made

So peaceful rests , without a stone , a name
What once had beauty , titles , wealth , and fame

How loved , how honour 'd once , avails thee not
To whom related , or by whom begot

A heap of dust alone remains of thee
'T is all thou art , and all the proud shall be

Poets themselves must fall , like those they sung
Deaf the praised ear , and mute the tuneful tongue

Even he , whose soul now melts in mournful lays
Shall shortly want the generous tear he pays

Then from his closing eyes thy form shall part
And the last pang shall tear thee from his heart

Life 's idle business at one gasp be o'er
The Muse forgot , and thou beloved no more

To wake the soul by tender strokes of art
To raise the genius , and to mend the heart

To make mankind , in conscious virtue bold
Live o'er each scene , and be what they behold

For this the tragic Muse first trod the stage
Commanding tears to stream through every age

Tyrants no more their savage nature kept
And foes to virtue wonder 'd how they wept

Our author shuns by vulgar springs to move
The hero 's glory , or the virgin 's love

In pitying love , we but our weakness show
And wild ambition well deserves its woe

Here tears shall flow from a more generous cause
Such tears as patriots shed for dying laws

He bids your breasts with ancient ardour rise
And calls forth Roman drops from British eyes

Virtue confess 'd in human shape he draws
What Plato thought , and godlike Cato was

No common object to your sight displays
But what with pleasure Heaven itself surveys

A brave man struggling in the storms of fate
And greatly falling with a falling state

While Cato gives his little senate laws
What bosom beats not in his country 's cause

Who sees him act , but envies every deed
Who hears him groan , and does not wish to bleed

Even when proud Caesar , 'midst triumphal cars
The spoils of nations , and the pomp of wars

Ignobly vain and impotently great
Show 'd Rome her Cato 's figure drawn in state

As her dead father 's reverend image passed
The pomp was darken 'd and the day o'ercast

The triumph ceased , tears gush 'd from every eye
The world 's great victor pass 'd unheeded by

Her last good man dejected Rome adored
And honour 'd Caesar 's less than Cato 's sword

Britons , attend : be worth like this approved
And show you have the virtue to be moved

With honest scorn the first famed Cato viewed
Rome learning arts from Greece , whom she subdued

Your scene precariously subsists too long
On French translation , and Italian song

Dare to have sense yourselves ; assert the stage
Be justly warm 'd with your own native rage

Such plays alone should win a British ear
As Cato 's self had not disdain 'd to hear

In that soft season , when descending showers
Call forth the greens , and wake the rising flowers

When opening buds salute the welcome day
And earth relenting feels the genial ray

As balmy sleep had charm 'd my cares to rest
And love itself was banish 'd from my breast

( What time the morn mysterious visions brings
While purer slumbers spread their golden wings

A train of phantoms in wild order rose
And , join 'd , this intellectual scene compose

I stood , methought , betwixt earth , seas , and skies
The whole creation open to my eyes

In air self-balanced hung the globe below
Where mountains rise and circling oceans flow

Here naked rocks , and empty wastes were seen
There towery cities , and the forests green

Here sailing ships delight the wandering eyes
There trees , and intermingled temples rise

Now a clear sun the shining scene displays
The transient landscape now in clouds decays

O'er the wide prospect , as I gazed around
Sudden I heard a wild promiscuous sound

Like broken thunders that at distance roar
Or billows murmuring on the hollow shore

Then gazing up , a glorious pile beheld
Whose towering summit ambient clouds concealed

High on a rock of ice the structure lay
Steep its ascent , and slippery was the way

The wondrous rock like Parian marble shone
And seem 'd , to distant sight , of solid stone

Inscriptions here of various names I viewed
The greater part by hostile time subdued

Yet wide was spread their fame in ages past
And poets once had promised they should last

Some fresh engraved appear 'd of wits renowned
I look 'd again , nor could their trace be found

Critics I saw , that other names deface
And fix their own , with labour , in their place

Their own , like others , soon their place resigned
Or disappear 'd , and left the first behind

Nor was the work impair 'd by storms alone
But felt the approaches of too warm a sun

For Fame , impatient of extremes , decays
Not more by envy than excess of praise

Yet part no injuries of heaven could feel
Like crystal faithful to the graving steel

The rock 's high summit , in the temple 's shade
Nor heat could melt , nor beating storm invade

Their names inscribed unnumber 'd ages past
From time 's first birth , with time itself shall last

These ever new , nor subject to decays
Spread , and grow brighter with the length of days

So Zembla 's rocks ( the beauteous work of frost
Rise white in air , and glitter o'er the coast

Pale suns , unfelt , at distance roll away
And on the impassive ice the lightnings play

Eternal snows the growing mass supply
Till the bright mountains prop the incumbent sky

As Atlas fix 'd , each hoary pile appears
The gather 'd winter of a thousand years

On this foundation Fame 's high temple stands
Stupendous pile ! not rear 'd by mortal hands

Whate'er proud Rome or artful Greece beheld
Or elder Babylon , its frame excelled

Four faces had the dome , and every face
Of various structure , but of equal grace

Four brazen gates , on columns lifted high
Salute the different quarters of the sky

Here fabled chiefs in darker ages born
Or worthies old , whom arms or arts adorn

Who cities raised , or tamed a monstrous race
The walls in venerable order grace

Heroes in animated marble frown
And legislators seem to think in stone

Westward , a sumptuous frontispiece appeared
On Doric pillars of white marble reared

Crown 'd with an architrave of antique mould
And sculpture rising on the roughen 'd gold

In shaggy spoils here Theseus was beheld
And Perseus dreadful with Minerva 's shield

There great Alcides stooping with his toil
Rests on his club , and holds th ' Hesperian spoil

Here Orpheus sings ; trees , moving to the sound
Start from their roots , and form a shade around

Amphion there the loud creating lyre
Strikes , and behold a sudden Thebes aspire

Cythaeron 's echoes answer to his call
And half the mountain rolls into a wall

There might you see the lengthening spires ascend
The domes swell up , the widening arches bend

The growing towers , like exhalations rise
And the huge columns heave into the skies

The eastern front was glorious to behold
With diamond flaming , and barbaric gold

There Ninus shone , who spread the Assyrian fame
And the great founder of the Persian name

There in long robes the royal Magi stand
Grave Zoroaster waves the circling wand

The sage Chaldeans robed in white appeared
And Brachmans , deep in desert woods revered

These stopp 'd the moon , and call 'd the unbodied shades
To midnight banquets in the glimmering glades

Made visionary fabrics round them rise
And airy spectres skim before their eyes

Of talismans and sigils knew the power
And careful watch 'd the planetary hour

Superior , and alone , Confucius stood
Who taught that useful science -- to be good

But on the south , a long majestic race
Of Egypt 's priests the gilded niches grace

Who measured earth , described the starry spheres
And traced the long records of lunar years

High on his car Sesostris struck my view
Whom sceptred slaves in golden harness drew

His hands a bow and pointed javelin hold
His giant limbs are arm 'd in scales of gold

Between the statues obelisks were placed
And the learn 'd walls with hieroglyphics graced

Of Gothic structure was the northern side
O'erwrought with ornaments of barbarous pride

There huge Colosses rose , with trophies crowned
And Runic characters were graved around

There sat Zamolxis with erected eyes
And Odin here in mimic trances dies

There on rude iron columns , smear 'd with blood
The horrid forms of Seythian heroes stood

Druids and Bards ( their once loud harps unstrung
And youths that died to be by poets sung

These , and a thousand more of doubtful fame
To whom old fables gave a lasting name

In ranks adorn 'd the temple 's outward face
The wall , in lustre and effect like glass

Which o'er each object casting various dyes
Enlarges some , and others multiplies

Nor void of emblem was the mystic wall
For thus romantic Fame increases all

The temple shakes , the sounding gates unfold
Wide vaults appear , and roofs of fretted gold

Raised on a thousand pillars , wreathed around
With laurel foliage , and with eagles crowned

Of bright , transparent beryl were the walls
The friezes gold , and gold the capitals

As heaven with stars , the roof with jewels glows
And ever-living lamps depend in rows

Full in the passage of each spacious gate
The sage historians in white garments wait

Graved o'er their seats the form of Time was found
His scythe reversed , and both his pinions bound

Within stood heroes , who through loud alarms
In bloody fields pursued renown in arms

High on a throne , with trophies charged , I viewed
The youth that all things but himself subdued

His feet on sceptres and tiaras trod
And his horn 'd head belied the Libyan god

There Caesar , graced with both Minervas , shone
Caesar , the world 's great master , and his own

Unmoved , superior still in every state
And scarce detested in his country 's fate

But chief were those , who not for empire fought
But with their toils their people 's safety bought

High o'er the rest Epaminondas stood
Timoleon , glorious in his brother 's blood

Bold Scipio , saviour of the Roman state
Great in his triumphs , in retirement great

And wise Aurelius , in whose well-taught mind
With boundless power unbounded virtue joined

Much-suffering heroes next their honours claim
Those of less noisy , and less guilty fame

Fair Virtue 's silent train : supreme of these
Here ever shines the godlike Socrates

He whom ungrateful Athens could expel
At all times just , but when he sign 'd the shell

Here his abode the martyr 'd Phocion claims
With Agis , not the last of Spartan names

Unconquer 'd Cato shows the wound he tore
And Brutus his ill Genius meets no more

But in the centre of the hallow 'd choir
Six pompous columns o'er the rest aspire

Around the shrine itself of Fame they stand
Hold the chief honours , and the fane command

High on the first , the mighty Homer shone
Eternal adamant composed his throne

Father of verse ! in holy fillets dressed
His silver beard waved gently o'er his breast

Though blind , a boldness in his looks appears
In years he seem 'd , but not impair 'd by years

The wars of Troy were round the pillar seen
Here fierce Tydides wounds the Cyprian Queen

Here Hector , glorious from Patroclus ' fall
Here dragg 'd in triumph round the Trojan wall

Motion and life did every part inspire
Bold was the work , and proved the master 's fire

A strong expression most he seem 'd to affect
And here and there disclosed a brave neglect

A golden column next in rank appeared
On which a shrine of purest gold was reared

Finish 'd the whole , and labour 'd every part
With patient touches of unwearied art

The Mantuan there in sober triumph sate
Composed his posture , and his look sedate

On Homer still he fix 'd a reverend eye
Great without pride , in modest majesty

In living sculpture on the sides were spread
The Latian wars , and haughty Turnus dead

Eliza stretch 'd upon the funeral pyre
AEneas bending with his aged sire

Troy flamed in burning gold , and o'er the throne
ARMS AND THE MAN in golden cyphers shone

Four swans sustain a car of silver bright
With heads advanced , and pinions stretch 'd for flight

Here , like some furious prophet , Pindar rode
And seem 'd to labour with the inspiring god

Across the harp a careless hand he flings
And boldly sinks into the sounding strings

The figured games of Greece the column grace
Neptune and Jove survey the rapid race

The youths hang o'er their chariots as they run
The fiery steeds seem starting from the stone

The champions in distorted postures threat
And all appear 'd irregularly great

Here happy Horace tuned the Ausonian lyre
To sweeter sounds , and temper 'd Pindar 's fire

Pleased with Alcaeus ' manly rage t ' infuse
The softer spirit of the Sapphic Muse

The polish 'd pillar different sculptures grace
A work outlasting monumental brass

Here smiling Loves and Bacchanals appear
The Julian star , and great Augustus here

The doves that round the infant poet spread
Myrtles and bays , hung hovering o'er his head

Here in a shrine that cast a dazzling light
Sat , fix 'd in thought , the mighty Stagyrite

His sacred head a radiant zodiac crowned
And various animals his side surround

His piercing eyes , erect , appear to view
Superior worlds , and look all Nature through

With equal rays immortal Tully shone
The Roman rostra deck 'd the Consul 's throne

Gathering his flowing robe , he seem 'd to stand
In act to speak , and graceful stretch 'd his hand

Behind , Rome 's Genius waits with civic crowns
And the great Father of his country owns

These massy columns in a circle rise
O'er which a pompous dome invades the skies

Scarce to the top I stretch 'd my aching sight
So large it spread , and swell 'd to such a height

Full in the midst , proud Fame 's imperial seat
With jewels blazed , magnificently great

The vivid emeralds there revive the eye
The flaming rubies show their sanguine dye

Bright azure rays from lively sapphires stream
And lucid amber casts a golden gleam

With various-colour 'd light the pavement shone
And all on fire appear 'd the glowing throne

The dome 's high arch reflects the mingled blaze
And forms a rainbow of alternate rays

When on the goddess first I cast my sight
Scarce seem 'd her stature of a cubit 's height

But swell 'd to larger size , the more I gazed
Till to the roof her towering front she raised

With her , the temple every moment grew
And ampler vistas open 'd to my view

Upward the columns shoot , the roofs ascend
And arches widen , and long aisles extend

Such was her form as ancient bards have told
Wings raise her arms , and wings her feet infold

A thousand busy tongues the goddess bears
A thousand open eyes , and thousand listening ears

Beneath , in order ranged , the tuneful Nine
( Her virgin handmaids ) still attend the shrine

With eyes on Fame for ever fix 'd , they sing
For Fame they raise the voice , and tune the string

With Time 's first birth began the heavenly lays
And last , eternal , through the length of days

Around these wonders as I cast a look
The trumpet sounded , and the temple shook

And all the nations , summon 'd at the call
From different quarters fill the crowded hall

Of various tongues the mingled sounds were heard
In various garbs promiscuous throngs appeared

Thick as the bees , that with the spring renew
Their flowery toils , and sip the fragrant dew

When the wing 'd colonies first tempt the sky
O'er dusky fields and shaded waters fly

Or settling , seize the sweets the blossoms yield
And a low murmur runs along the field

Millions of suppliant crowds the shrine attend
And all degrees before the goddess bend

The poor , the rich , the valiant , and the sage
And boasting youth , and narrative old age

Their pleas were different , their request the same
For good and bad alike are fond of Fame

Some she disgraced , and some with honours crowned
Unlike successes equal merits found

Thus her blind sister , fickle Fortune , reigns
And , undiscerning , scatters crowns and chains

First at the shrine the learned world appear
And to the goddess thus prefer their prayer

'Long have we sought to instruct and please mankind
With studies pale , with midnight vigils blind

But thank 'd by few , rewarded yet by none
We here appeal to thy superior throne

On wit and learning the just prize bestow
For fame is all we must expect below

The goddess heard , and bade the Muses raise
The golden trumpet of eternal praise

From pole to pole the winds diffuse the sound
That fills the circuit of the world around

Not all at once , as thunder breaks the cloud
The notes at first were rather sweet than loud

By just degrees they every moment rise
Fill the wide earth , and gain upon the skies

At every breath were balmy odours shed
Which still grew sweeter as they wider spread

Less fragrant scents the unfolding rose exhales
Or spices breathing in Arabian gales

Next these , the good and just , an awful train
Thus on their knees address the sacred fane

'Since living virtue is with envy cursed
And the best men are treated like the worst

Do thou , just goddess , call our merits forth
And give each deed the exact intrinsic worth

'Not with bare justice shall your act be crowned
( Said Fame ) , 'but high above desert renowned

Let fuller notes the applauding world amaze
And the loud clarion labour in your praise

This band dismiss 'd , behold , another crowd
Preferr 'd the same request , and lowly bowed

The constant tenor of whose well-spent days
No less deserved a just return of praise

But straight the direful trump of Slander sounds
Through the big dome the doubling thunder bounds

Loud as the burst of cannon rends the skies
The dire report through every region flies

In every ear incessant rumours rung
And gathering scandals grew on every tongue

From the black trumpet 's rusty concave broke
Sulphureous flames , and clouds of rolling smoke

The poisonous vapour blots the purple skies
And withers all before it as it flies

A troop came next , who crowns and armour wore
And proud defiance in their looks they bore

'For thee ' ( they cried ) , 'amidst alarms and strife
We sail 'd in tempests down the stream of life

For thee whole nations fill 'd with flames and blood
And swam to empire through the purple flood

Those ills we dared , thy inspiration own
What virtue seem 'd , was done for thee alone

'Ambitious fools ! ' ( the Queen replied , and frowned
'Be all your acts in dark oblivion drowned

There sleep forgot , with mighty tyrants gone
Your statues moulder 'd , and your names unknown

A sudden cloud straight snatch 'd them from my sight
And each majestic phantom sunk in night

Then came the smallest tribe I yet had seen
Plain was their dress , and modest was their mien

'Great idol of mankind ! we neither claim
The praise of merit , nor aspire to fame

But safe in deserts from the applause of men
Would die unheard of , as we lived unseen

'T is all we beg thee , to conceal from sight
Those acts of goodness which themselves requite

Oh let us still the secret joy partake
To follow virtue even for virtue 's sake

'And live there men , who slight immortal Fame
Who then with incense shall adore our name

But , mortals ! know , 't is still our greatest pride
To blaze those virtues which the good would hide

Rise , Muses , rise ! add all your tuneful breath
These must not sleep in darkness and in death

She said : in air the trembling music floats
And on the winds triumphant swell the notes

So soft , though high , so loud , and yet so clear
Even listening angels lean 'd from heaven to hear

To furthest shores the ambrosial spirit flies
Sweet to the world , and grateful to the skies

Next these a youthful train their vows expressed
With feathers crown 'd , with gay embroidery dressed

'Hither ' ( they cried ) 'direct your eyes , and see
The men of pleasure , dress , and gallantry

Ours is the place at banquets , balls , and plays
Sprightly our nights , polite are all our days

Courts we frequent , where 't is our pleasing care
To pay due visits , and address the fair

In fact , 't is true , no nymph we could persuade
But still in fancy vanquish 'd every maid

Of unknown duchesses lewd tales we tell
Yet , would the world believe us , all were well

The joy let others have , and we the name
And what we want in pleasure , grant in fame

The Queen assents , the trumpet rends the skies
And at each blast a lady 's honour dies

Pleased with the strange success , vast numbers pressed
Around the shrine , and made the same request

'What ! you , ' ( she cried ) 'unlearn 'd in arts to please
Slaves to yourselves , and even fatigued with ease

Who lose a length of undeserving days
Would you usurp the lover 's dear-bought praise

To just contempt , ye vain pretenders , fall
The people 's fable and the scorn of all

Straight the black clarion sends a horrid sound
Loud laughs burst out , and bitter scoffs fly round

Whispers are heard , with taunts reviling loud
And scornful hisses run through all the crowd

Last , those who boast of mighty mischiefs done
Enslave their country , or usurp a throne

Or who their glory 's dire foundation laid
On sovereigns ruin 'd , or on friends betrayed

Calm , thinking villains , whom no faith could fix
Of crooked counsels , and dark politics

Of these a gloomy tribe surround the throne
And beg to make the immortal treasons known

The trumpet roars , long flaky flames expire
With sparks , that seem 'd to set the world on fire

At the dread sound , pale mortals stood aghast
And startled Nature trembled with the blast

This having heard and seen , some Power unknown
Straight changed the scene , and snatch 'd me from the throne

Before my view appear 'd a structure fair
Its site uncertain , if in earth or air

With rapid motion turn 'd the mansion round
With ceaseless noise the ringing walls resound

Not less in number were the spacious doors
Than leaves on trees , or sands upon the shores

Which still unfolded stand , by night , by day
Pervious to winds , and open every way

As flames by nature to the skies ascend
As weighty bodies to the centre tend

As to the sea returning rivers roll
And the touch 'd needle trembles to the pole

Hither , as to their proper place , arise
All various sounds from earth , and seas , and skies

Or spoke aloud , or whisper 'd in the ear
Nor ever silence , rest , or peace is here

As on the smooth expanse of crystal lakes
The sinking stone at first a circle makes

The trembling surface by the motion stirred
Spreads in a second circle , then a third

Wide , and more wide , the floating rings advance
Fill all the watery plain , and to the margin dance

Thus every voice and sound , when first they break
On neighbouring air a soft impression make

Another ambient circle then they move
That , in its turn , impels the next above

Through undulating air the sounds are sent
And spread o'er all the fluid element

There various news I heard of love and strife
Of peace and war , health , sickness , death , and life

Of loss and gain , of famine and of store
Of storms at sea , and travels on the shore

Of prodigies , and portents seen in air
Of fires and plagues , and stars with blazing hair

Of turns of fortune , changes in the state
The falls of favourites , projects of the great

Of old mismanagements , taxations new
All neither wholly false , nor wholly true

Above , below , without , within , around
Confused , unnumber 'd multitudes are found

Who pass , repass , advance , and glide away
Hosts raised by fear , and phantoms of a day

Astrologers , that future fates foreshow
Projectors , quacks , and lawyers not a few

And priests , and party-zealots , numerous bands
With home-born lies , or tales from foreign lands

Each talk 'd aloud , or in some secret place
And wild impatience stared in every face

The flying rumours gather 'd as they rolled
Scarce any tale was sooner heard than told

And all who told it added something new
And all who heard it made enlargements too

Thus flying east and west , and north and south
News travell 'd with increase from mouth to mouth

So from a spark , that kindled first by chance
With gathering force the quickening flames advance

Till to the clouds their curling heads aspire
And towers and temples sink in floods of fire

When thus ripe lies are to perfection sprung
Full grown , and fit to grace a mortal tongue

Through thousand vents , impatient , forth they flow
And rush in millions on the world below

Fame sits aloft , and points them out their course
Their date determines , and prescribes their force

Some to remain , and some to perish soon
Or wane and wax alternate like the moon

Around , a thousand winged wonders fly
Born by the trumpet 's blast , and scatter 'd through the sky

There , at one passage , oft you might survey
A lie and truth contending for the way

And long 't was doubtful , both so closely pent
Which first should issue through the narrow vent

At last agreed , together out they fly
Inseparable now , the truth and lie

The strict companions are for ever joined
And this or that unmix 'd , no mortal e'er shall find

While thus I stood , intent to see and hear
One came , methought , and whisper 'd in my ear

'What could thus high thy rash ambition raise
Art thou , fond youth , a candidate for praise

'' Tis true , ' said I , 'not void of hopes I came
For who so fond as youthful bards of fame

But few , alas ! the casual blessing boast
So hard to gain , so easy to be lost

How vain that second life in others ' breath
The estate which wits inherit after death

Ease , health , and life , for this they must resign
( Unsure the tenure , but how vast the fine

The great man 's curse , without the gains , endure
Be envied , wretched , and be flatter 'd , poor

All luckless wits their enemies professed
And all successful , jealous friends at best

Nor Fame I slight , nor for her favours call
She comes unlook 'd for , if she comes at all

But if the purchase costs so dear a price
As soothing folly , or exalting vice

Oh ! if the Muse must flatter lawless sway
And follow still where fortune leads the way

Or if no basis bear my rising name
But the fallen ruins of another 's fame

Then teach me , Heaven ! to scorn the guilty bays
Drive from my breast that wretched lust of praise

Unblemish 'd let me live , or die unknown
Oh , grant an honest fame , or grant me none

In these deep solitudes and awful cells
Where heavenly-pensive Contemplation dwells

And ever-musing Melancholy reigns
What means this tumult in a vestal 's veins

Why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat
Why feels my heart its long-forgotten heat

Yet , yet I love ! -- From Abelard it came
And Eloisa yet must kiss the name

Dear fatal name ! rest ever unrevealed
Nor pass these lips in holy silence sealed

Hide it , my heart , within that close disguise
Where , mix 'd with God 's , his loved idea lies

Oh write it not , my hand ! -- the name appears
Already written -- wash it out , my tears

In vain lost Eloisa weeps and prays
Her heart still dictates , and her hand obeys

Relentless walls ! whose darksome round contains
Repentant sighs , and voluntary pains

Ye rugged rocks ! which holy knees have worn
Ye grots and caverns , shagg 'd with horrid thorn

Shrines ! where their vigils pale-eyed virgins keep
And pitying saints , whose statues learn to weep

Though cold like you , unmoved and silent grown
I have not yet forgot myself to stone

All is not Heaven 's while Abelard has part
Still rebel nature holds out half my heart

Nor prayers nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain
Nor tears for ages taught to flow in vain

Soon as thy letters trembling I unclose
That well-known name awakens all my woes

Oh , name for ever sad ! for ever dear
Still breathed in sighs , still usher 'd with a tear

I tremble too , where'er my own I find
Some dire misfortune follows close behind

Line after line my gushing eyes o'erflow
Led through a sad variety of woe

Now warm in love , now withering in my bloom
Lost in a convent 's solitary gloom

There stern religion quench 'd the unwilling flame
There died the best of passions , Love and Fame

Yet write , oh ! write me all , that I may join
Griefs to thy griefs , and echo sighs to thine

Nor foes nor fortune take this power away
And is my Abelard less kind than they

Tears still are mine , and those I need not spare
Love but demands what else were shed in prayer

No happier task these faded eyes pursue
To read and weep is all they now can do

Then share thy pain , allow that sad relief
Ah , more than share it , give me all thy grief

Heaven first taught letters for some wretch 's aid
Some banish 'd lover , or some captive maid

They live , they speak , they breathe what love inspires
Warm from the soul , and faithful to its fires

The virgin 's wish without her fears impart
Excuse the blush , and pour out all the heart

Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul
And waft a sigh from Indus to the Pole

Thou know'st how guiltless first I met thy flame
When Love approach 'd me under Friendship 's name

My fancy form 'd thee of angelic kind
Some emanation of the all-beauteous Mind

Those smiling eyes , attempering every ray
Shone sweetly lambent with celestial day

Guiltless I gazed ; Heaven listen 'd while you sung
And truths divine came mended from that tongue

From lips like those , what precept fail 'd to move
Too soon they taught me 't was no sin to love

Back through the paths of pleasing sense I ran
Nor wish 'd an angel whom I loved a man

Dim and remote the joys of saints I see
Nor envy them that heaven I lose for thee

How oft , when press 'd to marriage , have I said
Curse on all laws but those which Love has made

Love , free as air , at sight of human ties
Spreads his light wings , and in a moment flies

Let wealth , let honour , wait the wedded dame
August her deed , and sacred be her fame

Before true passion all those views remove
Fame , wealth , and honour ! what are you to Love

The jealous god , when we profane his fires
Those restless passions in revenge inspires

And bids them make mistaken mortals groan
Who seek in love for aught but love alone

Should at my feet the world 's great master fall
Himself , his throne , his world , I 'd scorn them all

Not Caesar 's empress would I deign to prove
No , make me mistress to the man I love

If there be yet another name more free
More fond than mistress , make me that to thee

Oh , happy state ! when souls each other draw
When love is liberty , and nature law

All then is full , possessing and possessed
No craving void left aching in the breast

Even thought meets thought , ere from the lips it part
And each warm wish springs mutual from the heart

This , sure , is bliss ( if bliss on earth there be
And once the lot of Abelard and me

Alas , how changed ! what sudden horrors rise
A naked lover bound and bleeding lies

Where , where was Eloise ? her voice , her hand
Her poniard , had opposed the dire command

Barbarian , stay ! that bloody stroke restrain
The crime was common , common be the pain

I can no more ; by shame , by rage suppressed
Let tears and burning blushes speak the rest

Canst thou forget that sad , that solemn day
When victims at yon altar 's foot we lay

Canst thou forget what tears that moment fell
When , warm in youth , I bade the world farewell

As with cold lips I kiss 'd the sacred veil
The shrines all trembled , and the lamps grew pale

Heaven scarce believed the conquest it surveyed
And saints with wonder heard the vows I made

Yet then , to those dread altars as I drew
Not on the cross my eyes were fix 'd , but you

Not grace , or zeal , love only was my call
And if I lose thy love , I lose my all

Come ! with thy looks , thy words , relieve my woe
Those still at least are left thee to bestow

Still on that breast enamour 'd let me lie
Still drink delicious poison from thy eye

Pant on thy lip , and to thy heart be pressed
Give all thou canst -- and let me dream the rest

Ah , no ! instruct me other joys to prize
With other beauties charm my partial eyes

Full in my view set all the bright abode
And make my soul quit Abelard for God

Ah , think at least thy flock deserves thy care
Plants of thy hand , and children of thy prayer

From the false world in early youth they fled
By thee to mountains , wilds , and deserts led

You raised these hallow 'd walls ; the desert smiled
And Paradise was open 'd in the wild

No weeping orphan saw his father 's stores
Our shrines irradiate , or emblaze the floors

No silver saints , by dying misers given
Here bribed the rage of ill-requited Heaven

But such plain roofs as Piety could raise
And only vocal with the Maker 's praise

In these lone walls , ( their day 's eternal bound
These moss-grown domes with spiry turrets crowned

Where awful arches make a noonday night
And the dim windows shed a solemn light

Thy eyes diffused a reconciling ray
And gleams of glory brighten 'd all the day

But now no face divine contentment wears
'T is all blank sadness , or continual tears

See how the force of others ' prayers I try
( Oh pious fraud of amorous charity

But why should I on others ' prayers depend
Come thou , my father , brother , husband , friend

Ah , let thy handmaid , sister , daughter move
And all those tender names in one -- thy love

The darksome pines that , o'er yon rocks reclined
Wave high , and murmur to the hollow wind

The wandering streams that shine between the hills
The grots that echo to the tinkling rills

The dying gales that pant upon the trees
The lakes that quiver to the curling breeze

No more these scenes my meditation aid
Or lull to rest the visionary maid

But o'er the twilight groves and dusky caves
Long-sounding aisles , and intermingled graves

Black Melancholy sits , and round her throws
A death-like silence , and a dread repose

Her gloomy presence saddens all the scene
Shades every flower , and darkens every green

Deepens the murmur of the falling floods
And breathes a browner horror on the woods

Yet here for ever , ever must I stay
Sad proof how well a lover can obey

Death , only death , can break the lasting chain
And here , even then , shall my cold dust remain

Here all its frailties , all its flames resign
And wait till 't is no sin to mix with thine

Ah , wretch ! believed the spouse of God in vain
Confess 'd within the slave of love and man

Assist me , Heaven ! but whence arose that prayer
Sprung it from piety , or from despair

Even here , where frozen chastity retires
Love finds an altar for forbidden fires

I ought to grieve , but can not what I ought
I mourn the lover , not lament the fault

I view my crime , but kindle at the view
Repent old pleasures , and solicit new

Now turn 'd to Heaven , I weep my past offence
Now think of thee , and curse my innocence

Of all affliction taught a lover yet
'T is sure the hardest science to forget

How shall I lose the sin , yet keep the sense
And love the offender , yet detest the offence

How the dear object from the crime remove
Or how distinguish penitence from love

Unequal task ! a passion to resign
For hearts so touch 'd , so pierced , so lost as mine

Ere such a soul regains its peaceful state
How often must it love , how often hate

How often hope , despair , resent , regret
Conceal , disdain , -- do all things but forget

But let Heaven seize it , all at once 't is fired
Not touch 'd , but rapt ; not waken 'd , but inspired

Oh come ! oh teach me nature to subdue
Renounce my love , my life , myself -- and you

Fill my fond heart with God alone , for He
Alone can rival , can succeed to thee

How happy is the blameless Vestal 's lot
The world forgetting , by the world forgot

Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
Each prayer accepted , and each wish resigned

Labour and rest , that equal periods keep
'Obedient slumbers that can wake and weep

Desires composed , affections ever even
Tears that delight , and sighs that waft to heaven

Grace shines around her with serenest beams
And whispering angels prompt her golden dreams

For her the unfading rose of Eden blooms
And wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes

For her the spouse prepares the bridal ring
For her white virgins hymeneals sing

To sounds of heavenly harps she dies away
And melts in visions of eternal day

Far other dreams my erring soul employ
Far other raptures , of unholy joy

When at the close of each sad , sorrowing day
Fancy restores what vengeance snatch 'd away

Then conscience sleeps , and leaving nature free
All my loose soul unbounded springs to thee

O curst , dear horrors of all-conscious night
How glowing guilt exalts the keen delight

Provoking demons all restraint remove
And stir within me every source of love

I hear thee , view thee , gaze o'er all thy charms
And round thy phantom glue my clasping arms

I wake : -- no more I hear , no more I view
The phantom flies me , as unkind as you

I call aloud ; it hears not what I say
I stretch my empty arms ; it glides away

To dream once more I close my willing eyes
Ye soft illusions , dear deceits , arise

Alas , no more ! methinks we wandering go
Through dreary wastes , and weep each other 's woe

Where round some mouldering tower pale ivy creeps
And low-brow 'd rocks hang nodding o'er the deeps

Sudden you mount , you beckon from the skies
Clouds interpose , waves roar , and winds arise

I shriek , start up , the same sad prospect find
And wake to all the griefs I left behind

For thee the Fates , severely kind , ordain
A cool suspense from pleasure and from pain

Thy life a long dead calm of fix 'd repose
No pulse that riots , and no blood that glows

Still as the sea , ere winds were taught to blow
Or moving spirit bade the waters flow

Soft as the slumbers of a saint forgiven
And mild as opening gleams of promised heaven

Come , Abelard ! for what hast thou to dread
The torch of Venus burns not for the dead

Nature stands check 'd ; Religion disapproves
Even thou art cold -- yet Eloisa loves

Ah hopeless , lasting flames ! like those that burn
To light the dead , and warm the unfruitful urn

What scenes appear where'er I turn my view
The dear ideas , where I fly , pursue

Rise in the grove , before the altar rise
Stain all my soul , and wanton in my eyes

I waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee
Thy image steals between my God and me

Thy voice I seem in every hymn to hear
With every bead I drop too soft a tear

When from the censer clouds of fragrance roll
And swelling organs lift the rising soul

One thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight
Priests , tapers , temples , swim before my sight

In seas of flame my plunging soul is drowned
While altars blaze , and angels tremble round

While prostrate here in humble grief I lie
Kind , virtuous drops just gathering in my eye

While praying , trembling , in the dust I roll
And dawning grace is opening on my soul

Come , if thou dar'st , all charming as thou art
Oppose thyself to heaven ; dispute my heart

Come , with one glance of those deluding eyes
Blot out each bright idea of the skies

Take back that grace , those sorrows , and those tears
Take back my fruitless penitence and prayers

Snatch me , just mounting , from the blest abode
Assist the fiends , and tear me from my God

No , fly me , fly me , far as pole from pole
Rise Alps between us ! and whole oceans roll

Ah , come not , write not , think not once of me
Nor share one pang of all I felt for thee

Thy oaths I quit , thy memory resign
Forget , renounce me , hate whate'er was mine

Fair eyes , and tempting looks ( which yet I view
Long loved , adored ideas , all adieu

O Grace serene ! O Virtue heavenly fair
Divine oblivion of low-thoughted care

Fresh blooming Hope , gay daughter of the sky
And Faith , our early immortality

Enter , each mild , each amicable guest
Receive , and wrap me in eternal rest

See in her cell sad Eloisa spread
Propp 'd on some tomb , a neighbour of the dead

In each low wind methinks a spirit calls
And more than echoes talk along the walls

Here , as I watch 'd the dying lamps around
From yonder shrine I heard a hollow sound

'Come , sister , come ! ' ( it said , or seem 'd to say
'Thy place is here , sad sister , come away

Once like thyself , I trembled , wept , and prayed
Love 's victim then , though now a sainted maid

But all is calm in this eternal sleep
Here Grief forgets to groan , and Love to weep

Even Superstition loses every fear
For God , not man , absolves our frailties here

I come , I come ! prepare your roseate bowers
Celestial palms , and ever-blooming flowers

Thither , where sinners may have rest , I go
Where flames refined in breasts seraphic glow

Thou , Abelard ! the last sad office pay
And smooth my passage to the realms of day

See my lips tremble , and my eyeballs roll
Suck my last breath , and catch my flying soul

Ah , no ! -- in sacred vestments may'st thou stand
The hallow 'd taper trembling in thy hand

Present the cross before my lifted eye
Teach me at once , and learn of me to die

Ah , then thy once-loved Eloisa see
It will be then no crime to gaze on me

See from my cheek the transient roses fly
See the last sparkle languish in my eye

Till every motion , pulse , and breath be o'er
And even my Abelard be loved no more

O Death all-eloquent ! you only prove
What dust we doat on when 't is man we love

Then too , when fate shall thy fair frame destroy
( That cause of all my guilt , and all my joy

In trance ecstatic may thy pangs be drowned
Bright clouds descend , and angels watch thee round

From opening skies may streaming glories shine
And saints embrace thee with a love like mine

May one kind grave unite each hapless name
And graft my love immortal on thy fame

Then , ages hence , when all my woes are o'er
When this rebellious heart shall beat no more

If ever chance two wandering lovers brings
To Paraclete 's white walls and silver springs

O'er the pale marble shall they join their heads
And drink the falling tears each other sheds

Then sadly say , -- with mutual pity moved
'Oh , may we never love as these have loved

From the full choir when loud hosannas rise
And swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice

Amid that scene , if some relenting eye
Glance on the stone where our cold relics lie

Devotion 's self shall steal a thought from heaven
One human tear shall drop , and be forgiven

And sure , if Fate some future bard shall join
In sad similitude of griefs to mine

Condemn 'd whole years in absence to deplore
And image charms he must behold no more

Such if there be , who love so long , so well
Let him our sad , our tender story tell

The well-sung woes will soothe my pensive ghost
He best can paint them who shall feel them most

Such were the notes thy once-loved Poet sung
Till Death untimely stopp 'd his tuneful tongue

Oh just beheld and lost ! admired and mourned
With softest manners , gentlest arts adorned

Blest in each science , blest in every strain
Dear to the Muse ! to Harley dear -- in vain

For him , thou oft hast bid the world attend
Fond to forget the statesman in the friend

For Swift and him , despised the farce of state
The sober follies of the wise and great

Dext'rous , the craving , fawning crowd to quit
And pleased to 'scape from Flattery to Wit

Absent or dead , still let a friend be dear
( A sigh the absent claims , the dead a tear

Recall those nights that closed thy toilsome days
Still hear thy Parnell in his living lays

Who , careless now of interest , fame , or fate
Perhaps forgets that Oxford e'er was great

Or deeming meanest what we greatest call
Behold thee glorious only in thy fall

And sure , if aught below the seats divine
Can touch immortals , 't is a soul like thine

A soul supreme , in each hard instance tried
Above all pain , all passion , and all pride

The rage of power , the blast of public breath
The lust of lucre , and the dread of death

Ye careful angels , whom eternal Fate
Ordains , on earth and human acts to wait

Who turn with secret power this restless ball
And bid predestin 'd empires rise and fall

Your sacred aid religious monarchs own
When first they merit , then ascend the throne

But tyrants dread ye , lest your just decree
Transfer the power , and set the people free

See rescu 'd Britain at your altars bow
And hear her hymns your happy care avow

That still her axes and her rods support
The judge 's frown , and grace the awful court

That Law with all her pompous terror stands
To wrest the dagger from the traitor 's hands

And rigid justice reads the fatal word
Poises the balance first , then draws the sword

Britain her safety to your guidance owns
That she can sep'rate parricides from sons

That , impious rage disarm 'd , she lives and reigns
Her freedom kept by him , who broke her chains

And thou , great minister , above the rest
Of guardian spirits , be thou for ever blest

Thou , who of old wert sent to Israel 's court
With secret aid great David 's strong support

To mock the frantic rage of cruel Saul
And strike the useless javelin to the wall

Thy later care o'er William 's temples held
On Boyne 's propitious banks , the heav'nly shield

When power divine did sovereign right declare
And cannons mark'dwhom they were bid to spare

Still , blessed angel , be thy care the same
Be William 's life untouch 'd , as is his fame

Let him own thine , as Britain owns his hand
Save thou the king , as he has sav 'd the land

We angels ' forms in pious monarchs view
We reverence William ; for he acts like you

Like you , commission 'd to chastise and bless
He must avenge the world , and give it peace

Indulgent Fate our potent prayer receives
And still Britannia smiles , and William lives

The hero dear to earth , by heav'n beloved
By troubles must be vex 'd , by dangers proved

His foes must aid to make his fame complete
And fix his throne secure on their defeat

So , though with sudden rage the tempest comes
Though the winds roar , and though the water foams

Imperial Britain on the sea looks down
And smiling sees her rebel subject frown

Striking her cliff , the storm confirms her pow ' r
The waves but whiten her triumphant shore

In vain they would advance , in vain retreat
Broken they dash , and perish at her feet

For William still new wonders shall be shown
The powers that rescued , shall preserve the throne

Safe on his darling Britain 's joyful sea
Behold , the monarch ploughs his liquid way

His fleets in thunder through the world declare
Whose empire they obey , whose arms they bear

Bless 'd by aspiring winds , he finds the strand
Blacken 'd with clouds ; he sees the nations stand

In vsirious tongues he hears the captains dwell
On their great leader 's praise ; by turns they tell

And listen , each with emulous glory fired
How William conquer 'd , and how France retired

How Belgia freed the hero 's arm confessed
But trembled for the courage which she blessed

O Louis , from this great example know
To be at once a hero , and a foe

By sounding trumpets , hear , and rattling drums
When William to the open vengeance comes

And see the soldier plead the monarch 's right
Heading his troops , and foremost in the fight

Hence then , close Ambush and perfidious War
Down to your native seats of Night repair

And thou , Bellona , weep thy cruel pride
Restraiii 'd , behind the victor 's chariot tied

In brazen knots , and everlasting chains
( So Europe 's peace , so William 's fate ordains

While on the ivory chair , in happy state
He sits , secure in innocence , and great

In regal clemency ; and views beneath
Averted darts of rage , and pointless arms of death

See , whilst thou weep'st , fair Cloe , see
The world in sympathy with thee

The cheerful birds no longer sing
Each droops his head , and hangs his wing

The clouds have bent their bosom lower
And shed their sorrows in a shower

The brooks beyond their limits flow
And louder murmurs speak their woe

The nymphs and swains adopt thy cares
They heave thy sighs , and weep thy tears

Fantastic nymph ! that grief should move
Thy heart obdurate against Love

Strange tears ! whose power can soften all
But that dear breast on which they fall

Beneath a myrtle 's verdant shade
As Cloe half asleep was laid

Cupid perch 'd lightly on her breast
And in that heav'n desir 'd to rest

Over her paps his wings he spread
Between he found a downy bed

Still lay the god : the nymph surprised
Yet mistress of herself , devised

How she the vagrant might enthral
And captive him , who captives all

Her bodice half-way she unlaced
About his arms she shiy cast

The god awak 'd ; and thrice in vain
He strove to break the cruel chain

And thrice in vain he shook his wing
Incumber 'd in the silken string

Flutt'ring the god , and weeping said
Pity poor Cupid , generous maid

Who happen 'd , being blind , to stray
And on thy bosom lost his way

Who stray 'd , alas ! but knew too well
He never there must hope to dwell

Set an unhappy pris'ner free
Who ne'er intended harm to thee

To me pertains not , she replies
To know or care where Cupid flies

What are his haunts , or which his way
Where he would dwell , or whither stray

Yet will I never set thee free
For harm was meant , and harm to me

Vain fears that vex thy virgin heart
I 'll give thee up my bow and dart

Untangle but this cruel chain
And freely let me fly again

Agreed : secure my virgin heart
Instant give up thy bow and dart

The chain I 'll in return untie
And freely thou again shalt fly

Thus she the captive did deliver
The captive thus gave up his quiver

The god disarm 'd , e'er since that day
Passes his life in harmless play

Flies round , or sits upon her breast
A little , fluttering , idle guest

E'er since that day the beauteous maid
Governs the world in Cupid 's stead

Directs his arrow as she wills
Gives grief , or pleasure ; spares , or kills

Behind her neck her comely tresses tied
Her ivory quiver graceful by her side

A-hunting Cloe went : she lost her way
And through the woods uncertain chanc 'd to stray

Apollo passing by beheld the maid
And , Sister dear , bright Cynthia , turn , he said

The hunted hind lies close in yonder brake
Loud Cupid laugh 'd , to see the god 's mistake

And laughing , cried , Learn better , great divine
To know thy kindred , and to honour mine

Rightly advis 'd , far hence thy sister seek
Or on Meander 's bank , or Latmus ' peak

But in this nymph , my friend , my sister know
She draws my arrows , and she bends my bow

Fair Thames she haunts , and every neighb'ring grove
Sacred to soft recess , and gentle love

Go , with thy Cynthia , hurl the pointed spear
At the rough boar , or chase the flying deer

I and my Cloe take a nobler aim
At human hearts we fling , nor ever miss the game

In Heaven , one holiday , you read
In wise Anacreon , Ganymede

Drew heedless Cupid in , to throw
A main , to pass an hour , or so

The little Trojan , by the way
By Hermes taught , play 'd all the play

The god unhappily engaged
By nature rash , by play enraged

Complain 'd , and sigh 'd , and cried , and fretted
Lost every earthly thing he betted

In ready-money , all the store
Pick 'd up long since from Dana ' e 's shower

A snuff-box , set with bleeding hearts
Rubies , all pierc 'd with diamond darts

His nine-pins made of myrtle wood
( The tree in Ida 's forest stood

His bowl pure gold , the very same
Which Paris gave the Cyprian dame

Two table-books in shagreen covers
Fill 'd with good verse from real lovers

Merchandise rare ! a billet-doux
Its matter passionate , yet true

Heaps of hair rings , and cipher 'd seals
Rich trifles ; serious bagatelles

What sad disorders play begets
Desperate and mad , at length he sets

Those darts , whose points make gods adore
His might , and deprecate his power

Those darts , whence all our joy and pain
Arise : those darts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Come , seven 's the main

Cries Ganymede : the usual trick
Seven , slur a six ; eleven , a nick

Ill news goes fast : 't was quickly known
That simple Cupid was undone

Swifter than lightning Venus flew
Too late she found the thing too true

Guess how the goddess greets her son
Come hither , sirrah : no , begone

And , hark ye , is it so indeed
A comrade you for Ganymede

An imp as wicked , for his age
As any earthly lady 's page

A scandal and a scourge to Troy
A prince 's son ! a black -guard boy

A sharper , that with box and dice
Draws in young deities to vice

All Heaven is by the ears together
Since first that little rogue came hither

Juno herself has had no peace
And truly I 've been favour 'd less

For Jove , as Fame reports ( but Fame
Says things not fit for me to name

Has acted ill for such a god
And taken ways extremely odd

And thou , unhappy child , she said
( Her anger by her grief allayed

Unhappy child , who thus hast lost
All the estate we e'er could boast

Whither , O whither wilt thou run
Thy name despis 'd , thy weakness known

Nor shall thy shrine on earth be crowned
Nor shall thy power in Heaven be owned

Obedient Cupid kneeling cried
Cease , dearest mother , cease to chide

Gany 's a cheat , and I 'm a bubble
Yet why this great excess of trouble

The dice were false : the darts are gone
Yet how are you or I undone

The loss of these I can supply
With keener shafts from Cloe 's eye

Fear not , we e'er can be disgraced
While that bright magazine shall last

Your crowded altars still shall smoke
And man your friendly aid invoke

Jove shall again revere your power
And rise a swan , or fall a shower

When Cloe 's picture was to Venus shown
I Surpris 'd , the goddess took it for her own

And what , said she , does this bold painter mean
When was I bathing thus , and naked seen

As Cloe came into the room t'other day
I peevish began ; where so long could you stay

In your life-time you never regarded your hour
You promis 'd at two ; and ( pray look , child ) 't is four

A lady 's watch needs neither figures nor wheels
'T is enough , that 't is loaded with bawbles and seals

A temper so heedless no mortal can bear
Thus far I went on with a resolute air

Lord bless me , said she ; let a body but speak
Hero 's an ugly hard rose-bud fallen into my neck

It has hurt me , and vex 'd me to such a degree
See here ! for you never believe me ; pray see

On the left side my breast what a mark it has made
So saying , her bosom she careless displayed

That seat of delight I with wonder suited
And forgot every word I designed to have said

In sullen humour one day Jove
Sent Hermes down to Ida 's grove

Commanding Cupid to deliver
His store of darts , his total quiver

That Hermes should the weapons break
Or throw 'em into Lethe 's lake

Hermes , you know , must do his errand
He found his man , produc 'd his warrant

Cupid , your darts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â this very hour
There 's no contending against power

How sullen Jupiter , just now
I think I said ; and you 'll allow

That Cupid was as bad as he
Hear but the youngster 's repartee

Come , kinsman ( said the little god
Put off your wings , lay by your rod

Retire with me to yonder bower
And rest yourself for half an hour

'T is far indeed from hence to Heaven
But you fly fast ; and 't is but seven

We 'll take one cooling cup of nectar
And drink to this celestial hector

He break my dart , or hurt my power
He , Leda 's swan , and Danae 's shower

Go , bid him his wife 's tongue restrain
And mind his thunder , and his rain . ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â

My darts ! O certainly I 'll give 'em
From Cloe 's eyes he shall receive 'em

There 's one , the best in all my quiver
Twang ! through his very heart and liver

He then shall pine , and sigh , and rave
Good lord ! what bustle shall we have

Neptune must straight be sent to sea
And Flora summon 'd twice a day

One must find shells , and t'other flowers
For cooling grots , and fragrant bowers

That Cloe may be serv 'd in state
The Hours must at her toilet wait

Whilst all the reasoning fools below
Wonder their watches go too slow

Lybs must fly south , and Eurus east
For jewels for her hair and breast

No matter though their cruel haste
Sink cities , and lay forests waste

No matter though this fleet be lost
Or that lie wind-bound on the coast

What whispering in my mother 's ear
What care , that Juno should not hear

What woik among you scholar gods
Phcebus must write him am'rous odes

And thou , poor cousin , must compose
His letters in submissive prose

Whilst haughty Cloe , to sustain
The honour of my mystic reig-n

Shall all his gifts and vows disdain
And laugh at your old bully 's pain

Dear couz. , said Hermes in a fright
For Heaven 's sake , keep your darts ! good night

Resolve me , Cloe , what is this
Or forfeit me one precious kiss

'T is the first oflfspring of the Graces
Bears difterent forms in different places

Acknowledg 'd fine , where'er beheld
Yet fancied finer , when concealed

'T was Flora 's wealth , and Circe 's charm
Pandora 's box of good and harm

'T was Mars 's wish , Endymion 's dream
Apelles ' draught , and Ovid 's theme

This guided Theseus through the maze
And sent him home with life and praise

But this undid the Phiygian boy
And blew the flames that ruin 'd Troy

This show 'd great kindness to old Greece
And help 'd rich Jason to the fleece

This through the east just vengeance hurled
And lost poor Anthony the world

Injur 'd , though Lucrece found her doom
This banish 'd tyranny from Rome

Appeas 'd though Lais gain 'd her hire
This set Persepolis on fire

For this Alcides learn 'd to spin
His club laid down , and lion 's skin

For this Apollo deign 'd to keep
Witli servile care , a mortal 's sheep

For this the father of the gods
Content to leave his high abodes

In borrow 'd figures loosely ran
Europa 's bull , and Leda 's swan

For this he'reassumes the nod
( While Semele commands the God

Launches the bolt , and shakes the poles
Though Momus laughs , and Juno scolds

Here listening ' Cloe smil 'd and said
Your riddle is not hard to read

a guess it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â fair one , if you do
Need I , alas I the theme pursue

For this thou see'st , for this I leave
Whate'er the world thinks wise or grave

Ambition , business , friendship , news
My useful books , and serious Muse

For this I willingly decline
The mirth of feasts , and joys of wine

And choose to sit and talk with thee
( As thy groat orders may decree

Of cocks and bulls , and flutes and fiddles
Of idle tales , and foolish riddles

What nymph should I admire , or trust
But Cloe , beauteous Cloe , just

What nymph should I desire to see
But her who leaves the plain for me

To whom should I compose the lay
But her who listens when I play

To whom , in song^ , repeat my cares
But her who in my sorrow shares

For whom should I the garland make
But her who joys the gift to take

In love am I not fully blest
Lisetta , pr'ythee tell the rest

Sure , Cloe just , and Cloe fair
Deserves to be your only care

But when you and she to-day
Far into the wood did stray

And I happen 'd to pass by
Which way did you cast your eye

But when your cares to her you sing
Yet dare not tell her whence they spring

Does it not more afflict your heart
That in those cares she bears a part

When you the flowers for Cloe twine
Why do you to her garland join

Simplest of swains ! the world may see
Whom Cloe loves , and who loves me

Venus , take my votive glass
Since I am not what I was

What from this day I shall be
Venus , let me never see

The Trojan swain had judg 'd the great dispute
And beauty 's power obtain 'd the golden fruit

When Venus , loose in all her naked charms
Met Jove 's great daughter clad in shining arms

The wanton goddess vievv 'd the warlike maid
From head to foot , and tauntingly she said

My heart with her but , as guest-wise , sojourned
And now to Helen it is lionie returned

Yield , sister ; rival , yield : naked , you see
a vanquish : guess how potent I should be

If to the field I came in armour drest
Dreadful , like thine , my shield , and terrible my crest

The warrior goddess with disdain replied
Thy folly , child , is equal to thy pride

Let a brave enemy for once advise
And Venus ( if 't is possible ) be wise

Thou to be strong must put off every dress
Thy only armour is thy nakedness

And niore than once , ( or thou art much belied
By Mars himself that armour has been tried

From public noise and factious strife
From all the busy ills of life

Take me , my Celia , to thy breast
And lull my wearied soul to rest

For ever , in this humble cell
Let thee and I , my fair one , dwell

None enter else , but Love and he
Shall bar the door , and keep the key

To painted roofs , and shining spires
( Uneasy scats of high desires

Let the unthinking many crowd
That dare be covetous and proud

In golden bondage let them wait
And barter happiness for state

But oh ! my Celia , when thy swain
Desires to see a court again

May Heaven around this destin 'd head
The choicest of its curses shed

To sum up all the rage of Fate
In the two things I dread and hate

Thus , on his Celia 's panting breast
Fond Celadon his soul expressed

While with delight the lovely maid
Receiv 'd the vows , she thus repaid

Hope of my age , joy of my youth
Blest miracle of love and truth

All that could e'er be counted mine
My love and life , long since are thine

A real joy I never knew
Till I believ 'd thy passion true

A real grief I ne'er can find
Till thou prov'st perjur 'd or unkind

Contempt , and poverty , and care
All we abhor , and all we fear

Through waters , and through flames I 'll go
Sufferer and solace of thy woe

Trace me some yet unheard-of way
That I thy ardour may repay

And make my constant passion known
By more than woman yet has done

Had I a wish that did not bear
The stamp and image of my dear

I 'd pierce my heart through every vein
And die to let it out again

No ; Venus shall my witness be
( If Venus ever lov 'd like me

That for one hour I would not quit
My shepherd 's arms , and this retreat

To be the Persian monarch 's bride
Partner of all his power and pride

Or rule in regal state above
Mother of gods , and wife of Jove

O happy these of human race
But soon , alas ! our pleasures pass

He thank 'd her on his bended knee
Then drank a quart of milk and tea

And leaving her ador 'd embrace
Hasten 'd to court to beg a place

While she , his absence to bemoan
The very moment he was gone

Call 'd Thyrsis from beneath the bed
Where all tliis time he had been hid

While men have these ambitious fancies
And wanton wenches read romances

Our sex will ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â What ? out with it . Lie
And theirs in equal strains reply

The moral of the tale I sing
( A posy for a wedding ring

In tliis short verse will be confined
Ix ) ve is a jest , and vows are wind

Miss Danae , when fair and young
( As Horace has divinely sung

Could not be kept from Jove 's embrace
By doors of steel , and walls of brass

The reason of the thing is clear
Would Jove the naked truth aver

Cupid was with him of the party
And show 'd himself sincere and hearty

For , give that whipster but his errand
He takes my Lord Chief Justice ' warrant

Dauntless as death away he walks
Breaks the doors open ; snaps the locks

Searches the parlour , chamber , study
Nor stops till he has culprit 's body

Since this has been authentic truth
By age deliver 'd down to youth

Tell us , mistaken husband , tell us
Why so mysterious , why so jealous

Does the restraint , the bolt , the bar
Make us less curious , her less fair

The spy , which does this treasure keep
Does she ne'er say her prayers , nor sleep

Does she to no excess incline
Does she fly music , mirth , and wine

Or have not g^old and flattery power
To purchase one unguarded hour

Your care does farther yet extend
That spy is guarded by your friend . ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â

But has this friend nor eye , nor heart
May he not feel the cruel dart

Which , soon or late , all mortals feel
May he not , with too tender zeal

Give the fair pris'ner cause to see
How much he wishes she Avere free

May he not craftily infer
The rules of friendship too severe

Which chain him to a hated trust
Which make him wretched , to be just

Sir , Avill your questions never end
a trust to neither spy nor friend

In short , a keep her from the sight
Of every human face . ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â She 'll write

From pen and paper she 's debarred
Has she a bodkin and a card

She 'll prick her mind . ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â She will you say
But how shall she that mind convey

I keep her in one room ; I lock it
The key ( look here ) is in this pocket

The key-hole , is that left ? most certain
She 'll thrust her letter through ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Sir Martin

Dear angry friend , what must be done
Is there no way ? ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â There is but one

Send her abroad ; and let her see
That all this mingled mass , which she

Being forbidden , longs to know
Is a dull farce , an empty show

A staple of romance and lies
False tears , and real perjuries

Where sighs and looks are bought and sold
And love is made but to be told

Where the fat bawd , and lavish heir
The spoils of ruin 'd beauty share

And youth , seduc 'd from friends and fame
Must give up age to want and shame

Let her behold the frantic scene
The women wretched , false the men

And when , these certain ills to shun
She would to thy embraces run

Receive her with extended arms
Seem more delighted with her charms

Wait on her to the park and play
Put on good humour ; make her gay

Be to her virtues very kind
Be to her faults a little blind

Let all her ways be unconfined
And clap your padlock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â on her mind

Hans Carvel , impotent and old
Married a lass of London mould

Handsome ? enough ; extremely gay
Lov 'd music , company , and play

High flights she had , and wit at will
And so her tongue lay seldom still

For in all visits who but she
To argue , or to repartee

She made it plain , that human passion
Was order 'd by predestination

That if weak women went astray
Their stars were more in fault than they

Who ] e tragedies she had by heart
Enter 'd into Roxana 's part

To triumph in her rival 's blood
The action certainly was good

How like a vine young Ammon curl 'd I
Oh that deal ' conqueror of the world

She pitied Betterton in age
That ridicul 'd the god-like rage

She , first of all the town , was told
Where ne^vcst India thing 's were sold

So in a morning , without bodice
Slipt sometimes out to Mrs. Thody 's

To cheapen tea , to buy a screen
What else could so much virtue mean

For to prevent the least reproach
Betty went with her in the coach

But when no very great affair
Excited her peculiar care

She without fail was wak 'd at ten
Drank chocolate , then slept again

At twelve she rose ; with much ado
Her clothes were huddled on by two

Then , does my lady dine at home
Yes , sure ; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â but is the Colonel come

Next , how to spend the afternoon
And not come home again too soon

The Change , the City , or the Play
As each was proper for the day

A turn in summer to Hyde Park
When it grew tolerably dark

Wife 's pleasure causes husband 's pain
Strange fancies come in Hans 's brain

He thought of what he did not name
And would reform , but durst not blame

At fii'st he therefore preacli 'd his wife
The comforts of a pious life

Told her how transient beauty was
That all must die , and flesh was grass

He bought her sermons , psalms , and graces
And doubled down the useful places

Pjut still the weight of worldly care
Allow 'd her little time for prayer

And Cleopatra * was read o'er
While Scot , * and Wake^f and twenty more

That teach one to deny oneself
Stood unmolested on the shelf

An untouch 'd Bible grac 'd her toilet
No fear that thumb of hers should spoil it

In short , the trade was still the same
The dame went out , the colonel came

What 's to be done ? Poor Carvel cried
Another battery must be tried

What if to spells I had recourse
'T is but to hinder something worse

The end must justify the means
He only sins who ill intends

Since therefore 't is to combat evil
'T is lawful to employ the devil

Forthwith the devil did appear
( For name him , and he 's always near

Not in the shape in which he plies
At miss 's elbow when she lies

Or stands before the nursery doors
To take the naughty boy that roars

But , without saucer-eye or claw
Like a grave barrister at law

Hans Carvel , lay aside your grief
The devil says ; I bring relief

Relief , says Hans : pray let me crave
Your name , Sir , ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Satan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Sir , your slave

I did not look upon your feet
You 'll pardon me : Ay , now I see't

And pray , Sir , when came you from hell
Our friends there , did you leave them well

All well ; but pr'ythee , honest Hans
( Says Satan ) leave your complaisance

The truth is this : I can not stay
Flaring- in sunshine all the day

For , entre nous , we hellish sprites
Love more the fresco of the nights

And oftener our receipts convey
In dreams , than any other way

I tell you therefore as a friend
Ere morning dawns , your fears shall end

Go then this evening ' , master Carvel
Lay down your fowls , and broach your barrel

Let friends and wine dissolve your care
Whilst I the great receipt prepare : ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â

To-night I 'll bring it , by my faith
Believe for once what Satan saith

Away went Hans : glad ? not a little
Obey 'd the devil to a tittle

Invited friends some half a dozen
The colonel and my lady 's cousin

The meat was serv 'd ; the bowls were crowned
Catches were sung ; and healths went round

Barbadoes waters for the close
Till Hans had fairly got his dose

The colonel toasted to the best
The Dame mov 'd off , to be undiest

The chimes went twelve : the guests withdrew
But wheji , or how , Hans hardly knew

Some modern anecdotes aver
He nodded in his elbow chair

F ) om thence was carried off to bed
John held his heels , and Nan his head

My lady w'as disturb 'd : new sorrow
Which Hans must answer for to-morrow

In bed then view this happy pair
And think how Hymen triumph 'd there

Hans fast asleep as soon as laid
The duty of the night unpaid

The waking dame , with thoughts opprest
That made her hate both him and rest

By such a husband , such a wife
'T was Acme 's and Septimius ' life

The lady sigh 'd : the lover snored
The punctual devil kept his word

Appear 'd to honest Hans again
But not at all by madam seen

And giving him a magic ring
Fit for the finger of a king

Dear Hans , said he , this jewel take
And wear it long for Satan 's sake

'Twill do your business to a hair
For , long as you this ring shall wear

As sure as I look over Lincoln
That ne'er shall iiappen which you think on

Hans took the ring with joy extreme
( All this was only in a dream

And , thrusting it beyond his joint
'T is done , he cried : I 've gain 'd my point . ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â

What point , said she , you ugly beast
You neither give me joy nor rest

Tis done . ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â What 's done , you drunken bear
You 've thrust your finger G-d knows where

Fire , water , woman , are man 's ruin
Says wise professor Vander Bruin

By flames a house I hir 'd was lost
Last year , and I must pay the cost

This spring the rains o'erflow 'd my ground
And my best Flanders mare was drowned

A slave I am to Clara 's eyes
The gipsy knows her power , and flies

Fire , water , woman , are my ruin
And great thy wisdom , Vander Bruin

Beyond the fix 'd and settled rules
Of vice and virtue in the schools

Beyond the letter of the law
Which keeps our men and maids in awe

The better sort should set before 'em
A grace , a manner , a decorum

Something , that gives their acts a light
Makes 'em not only just , but bright

And sets them in that open fame
Which witty malice can not blame

For 't is in life , as 't is in painting-
Much may be right , yet much be wanting

From lines drawn true , our eye may trace
A foot , a knee , a hand , a face

May justly own the picture wrought
Exact to rule , exempt from fault

Yet , if the colouring be not there
The Titian stroke , the Guido air

To nicest judgment show the piece
At best 'twill only not displease

It ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ â€œ n'ould not gain on Jersey 's eye
Bradford would frown , and set it by

Thus in the picture of our mind
The action may be well designed

Guided by law , and bound by duty
Yet want this Je ne s^ay quoi of beauty

What is this talk ? replies a friend
And where will this dry moral end

The truth of w^hat you here lay down
By some example should be shown

.\n honest , but a simple pair
( And twenty other I forbear

A doctor of great skill and fame
Paulo Purganti was his name

Had a good , comely , virtuous wife
No woman led a better life

She to intrigues was e'en hard-hearted
She chuckled when a bawd was carted

And thought the nation ne'er would thrive
Till all the Avhores were burnt alive

On married men , that dar 'd be bad
She thought no mercy should be had

They should be hang 'd , or starv 'd , or flead
Or serv 'd Hke Romish priests in Swede

In short , all lewdness she defied
And stift ' was her parochial pride

Yet , in an honest way , the dame
Was a great lover of that same

And could from scripture take her cue
That husbands should give wives their due

Her prudence did so justly steer
Between the gay and the severe

That if in some regards she chose
To curb poor Paulo in too close

In others she relax 'd again
And govern 'd witli a looser rein

Thus though she strictly did confine
The doctor from excess of wine

With oysters , eggs , and vermicelli
She let him almost burst his belly

Thus drying coftee was denied
But chocolate that loss supplied

And for tobacco ( who could bear it
Filthy concomitant of claret

( Blest revolution ! ) one might see
Eringo roots , and bohea tea

She often set the doctor 's band
And strok 'd his beard , and squeez 'd his hand

Kindly complaiu 'd , that after noon
He went to pore on books too soon

She held it wholesomer by much
To rest a little on the couch

About his waist in bed a-nig '' hts
She ching- so close ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â for fear of sprites

The Doctor undei'stood the call
But had not always wherewithal

The lion 's skin too short , you know
( As Plutarch 's Morals finely show

Was lengthen 'd by the fox 's tail
And art supplies , where strength may fail

Unwilling- then , in arms to meet
The enemy he could not beat

He strove to lengthen the campaign
And save his forces by chicane

Fabius , the Roman chief , who thus
By fair retreat grew Maximus

Shows us , that all the warrior can do
With force inferior , is Cunctando

One day then , as the foe drew near
With love , and joy , and life , and dear

Our don , who knew this tittle-tattle
Did , sure as trumpet , call to battle

Thought it extremely a propos
To ward against the coming blow

To ward : but how ? Ay , there 's the question
Fierce the assault , unarm 'd the bastion

The doctor feign 'd a strange surprise
He felt her pulse ; he view 'd her eyes

That beat too fast , these roll 'd too quick
She was , he said , . or would be sick

He judg 'd it absolutely good
That she should purge and cleanse her blood

Spa waters for that end were got
If they pass 'd easily or not

What matters it ? the lady 's fever
Continued violent as ever

For a distemper of this kind
( Blackraore * and Hanst are of my mind

If once it youthful blood infects
And chiefly of the female sex

Is scarce remov 'd by pill or potion
Whate'er might be our doctor 's notion

One luckless night then , as in bed
The doctor and the dame were laid

Again this cruel fever came
High pulse , short breath , and blood in flame

Sad state of matters ! when we dare
Nor ask for peace , nor ofter war

Nor Livy nor Comines have shown
What in this juncture may be done

Grotius might own , that Paulo 's case is
Harder than any which he places

He strove , alas ! l ) ut strove in vain
By dint of logic to maintain

That all the sex was born to grieve
Down to her ladyship from Eve

He rang 'd his tropes , and preach 'd up patience
Back 'd his opinion with quotations

Divines and moraHsts ; and run ye on
Quite through from Seneca to Banyan

As much in vain he bid her try
To fold her arms , and close her eye

Telling ' her , rest would do her good
If any thing in nature could

So held the Greeks quite down from Galen
Masters and princes of their calling

So all our modern friends maintain
( Though no great Greeks ) in Warwick-lane

Reduce , my Muse , the wandering song
A tale should never be too long

The more he talk 'd , the more she burned
And sigh 'd , and toss 'd , and groan 'd , and turned

At last , I wish , said she , my dear
( And whisper 'd something in his ear

You wish ! wish on , the doctor cries
Lord ! when will womankind be wise

What , in youi ' waters ? are you mad
Why poison is not half so bad

I 'll do it but I give you warning
You 'll die before to-morrow morning

'T is kind , my dear , what you advise
The lady with a sigh replies

But life , you know , at best is pain
And death is what we shouhl disdain

So do it , therefore , and adieu
For I will die for love of you

Let wanton wives by death be scared
But , to my comfort , I 'm prepared

The sceptics think , 't was long- ag-o
Since gods came down incognito

To see who were their friends or foes
And how our actions fell or rose

That since they gave things their beginning
And set this whirligig a spinning

Supine they in their Heaven remain
Exempt from passion , and from pain

And frankly leave us human elves
To cut and shuffle for ourselves

The poets now , and painters hold
This thesis both absurd and bold

And your good-natur 'd gods , they say
Descend some twice or thrice a-day

Else all these things we toil so hard in
Would not avail one sing-lo farthing

For , when the hero we rehearse
To grace his actions and our verse

Tis not by dint of human thought
That to his Latium he is brought

Iris descends by Fate 's commands
To guide his steps through foreign lands

And Amphitrite clears the way
From rocks and quicksands in the sea

And if you see him in a sketch
( Though drawn by Paulo or Carache

He sheu 's not half his force and strength
Strutting in armour , and at length

That he may . take his proper figure
The piece must yet be four yards bigger

The nymphs conduct him to the field
One holds his Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ Â« \vord , and one his shield

Mars standing by asserts his quarrel
And Fame flies after with a laurel

These points , I say , of speculation
( As 'twere to save oi- sink the nation

Men idly learned will dispute
Assert , object , confirm , refute

Each mighty angiy , mighty right
With equal arms sustains the fight

Till now no umpire can agree 'em
So both draw off and sing- Te Deum

Is it in equilibrio
If deities descend or no

Then let the affirmative prevail
As requisite to form my tale

For by all parties 't is confest
That those opinions are the best

Which in their nature most conduce
To present ends , and private use

Two gods came therefore from above
One Mercury , the other Jove

The humour was ( it seems ) to know
If all the favours they bestow

Could from our own perverseness ease us
And if our wish enjoy 'd would please us

Discoursing ' largely on this theme
O'er hills and dales their godships came

Till , well nigh tir 'd and almost night
They thought it proper to alight

Note here , that it as true as odd is
That in disguise a god or goddess

Exerts no supernatural powers
But acts on maxims much like ours

They spied at last a country farm
Where all was snug , and clean , and Avarm

For woods before and hills behind
Secur 'd it both from rain and wind

Large oxen in the fields were lowing
Good grain was sow 'd ; good fruit was growing

Of last year 's corn in barns gi'eat store
Fat turkeys gobbling- at the door

And wealth ( in short ) with peace consented
That people here should live contented

But did they in effect do so
Have patience , friend , and thou shall know

The honest farmer and his wife
To yeai 'S declin 'd from prime of life

Had struggled with the marriage noose
As almost every couple does

Sometimes , my plague ! sometimes , my darling
Kissing to-day , to-morrow snarling

Jointly submitting to endure
That evil , which admits no cure

Our gods the outward gates unbarred
Our fanner met 'em in the yard

Thought they were folks that lost their way
And ask 'd them civilly to stay

Told 'em , for supper , or for bed
They might go on , and be worse sped

So said , so done : the gods consent
All three into the parlour went

They compliment ; they sit ; they chat
Fight o'er the wars ; reform the state

A thousand knotty points they clear
Till supper and my wife appear

Jove made his leg , and kiss 'd the dame
Obsequious Hermes did the same

Jove kiss 'd the farmer 's wife , you say
He did ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â but in an honest way

Oh ! not with half that warmth and life
With which he kiss 'd Amphitryon 's wife

Well then , things handsomely were served
My mistress for the strangers carved

How strong the beer , how good the meat
How loud they laugh 'd , how much they eat

In epic sumptuous would appear
Vet shall be pass 'd in silence here

For I should grieve to have it said
That , by a fine description led

I made my episode too long
Or tir 'd my friend , to grace my song

The grace-cup serv 'd , the cloth away
Jove thought it time to show his play

Landlord and landlady , he cried
Folly and jesting laid aside

That ye thus hospitably live
And strangers with good clieor receive

Is mighty grateful to your betters
And makes e'en gods themselves your debtors

To give this thesis plainer proof
You have to-night beneath your roof

A pair of gods ( nay , never wonder
This youth can fly , and I can thunder

I 'm Jupiter , and he Merciirius
My page , my son indeed , but spurious

Form then three wishes , you and madam
And sure , as you already had 'oni

The things desir 'd in half an hour
Shall all be here , and in your power

Thank ye , great gods , the woman says
Oh ! may your altars ever blaze

A ladle for our silver dish
Is what I want , is Avhat I wish . ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â

A ladle ! cries the man , a ladle
'Odzooks , Corisca , you have pray 'd ill

What should be great , you turn to farce
I wish the ladle in your arse

The ladle fell into the room
Aud stuck in old Corisca 's bum

( ) iir couple weep two wishes past
And kindly join to form the last

To ease the woman 's awkward pain
And a-et the ladle out as-ain

This commoner has worth and parts
is prais 'd for arms , or lov 'd for arts

His head aches for a coronet
And who is bless 'd that is not great

Some sense , and more estate , kind Heaven
To this well-lotted peer has given

What then ? he must have rule and sway
And all is Avrong , 'till he 's in play

The miser must make up his plum
And dares not touch the hoarded sum

The sickly dotard wants a wife
To di-a\v off his last dregs of life

Against our peace we arm our will
Amidst our plenty , something still

For horses , houses , pictin'es , planting
To thee , to me , to him is wanting

That cruel something unpossessed
( 'oriodes and leavens all the rest

That something , if we could obtain
Would soon create a future pain

And to the coffin , from the cradle
'T is all a Wish , and all a Ladle

Of all that William rules , or Robe
Describes , great Rhea , of thy globe

When or on post-horse , or in chaise
With much expense , and little ease

My destin 'd miles I shall have gone
By Thames or Maese , by Po or Rhone

Great Mother , let me once be able
To have a garden , house , and stable

That I may read , and ride , and plant
Superior to desire , or want

And as health fails , and years increase
Sit down , and think , and die in peace

Oblige thy favourite undertakers
To throw me in but twenty acres

This number sure they may allow
For ] ) asture ten , and ten for plow

'T is all that a Avould wish , or hope
For me and John , and Nell , and Crop

Then , as thou wilt , dispose the rest
( And let not Fortune spoil the jest

To those , who at the market-rate
Can barter honour for estate

Now if thou grant'st me my request
To make thy votai * y truly blest

Let curst revenge , and saucy pride
To some bleak rock far off be tied

Nor e'er approach my rural seat
To tempt me to be base and great

And , Goddess , this kind office done
Charge Venus to command her son

( Where-ever else she lets him rove
To shun ni } ' house , my field , my grove

Hear , gracious Rhea , what I say
And thy petitioner shall pray

Whate'er thy countrymen have done
By law and wit , by sword and gun

And all the living world , that view
Thy work , give thee the praises due

Yet for the fume of all these deeds
What beg'gar in the Invalides

Wish 'd ever decently to die
To have been either Mezeray

It 's strange , dear author , yet it true is
That , down from Pharamond to Louis

All feel the ill , yet shun the cure
Can sense this paradox endure

The man in g'raver tragic known
( Though his best part long since was done

And he who play 'd the Harlequin
After the jest still loads the scene

In awful pomp , and melancholy state
ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢See settled Reason on the judgment seat

Around her crowd Distrust , and Doubt , and Fear
And thoughtful Foresight , and tormenting Care

Far from the throne , the trembling Pleasures stand
Chain 'd up , or exil 'd by her stern command

Wretched her subjects , gloomy sits the queen
Till happy Chance reverts the cruel scene

And apish Folly with her wild resort
Of wit and jest disturbs the solemn court

See the fantastic minstrelsy advance
To breathe the song , and animate the dance

Blest the usurper ! happy the surprise-
Her mimic postures catch our eager eyes

Her jingling bells affect our captive ear
And in the sights we see , and sounds we hear

Against our judgment she our sense employs
The laws of troubled Reason she destroys

And in her place rejoices to indite-
Wild schemes of mirth , and plans of loose delight

Forgive the Muse , who , in unhallovv 'd strains
The Saint one moment from his God detains

For sure , whate'er you do , where'er you are
'T is all but one good work , one constant prayer

Forgive her ; and intreat that God , to whom
Thy favour 'd vows with kind acceptance come

To raise her notes to that sublime degree
Which suits a song of piety and thee

Wondrous good man ! whose labours may repel
The force of sin , may stop the rage of hell

Thou , like the Baptist , from thy God wast sent
The cr } 'ing voice , to bid the world repent

The Youth shall study , and no more engage
Their flattering wishes for uncertain age

No more with fruitless care , and cheated strife
Chase fleeting Pleasure through this maze of life

Finding the wretched all they here can have
But present food , and but a future grave

Each , great as Philip 's victor son , shall view
This abject world , and weeping , ask a new

Decrepid Age shall read thee , and confess
Thy labours can assuage , where medicines cease

Shall bless thy words , their wounded soul 's relief
The drops that sweeten their last dreg : s of life

Shall look to Heaven , and laugh at all beneath
Own riches gather 'd , trouble ; fame a breath

Thy even thoughts with so much plainness flow
Their sense untutor 'd infancy may know

Yet to such height is all that plainness Wrought
Wit may admire , and letter 'd Pride be taught

Diflus 'd its virtue , boundless is its power
'T is public health , and universal cure

Of heavenly manna 't is a second feast
A nation 's food , and all to every taste

To its last height mad Britain 's guilt was reared
And various death for various crimes she feared

With your kind work her drooping hopes revive
You bid her read , repent , adore , and live

You wrest the bolt from Heaven 's avenging hand
Stop ready death , and save a sinking land

O ! save us still : still bless us with thy stay
O ! want thy Heaven , till we have learnt the way

Refuse to leave thy destin 'd charge too soon
And for the church 's good , defer thy own

O ! live : and let thy works urge our belief
Live to e.xplain thy doctrine by thy life

Till future infancy , baptiz 'd by thee
Grow ripe in yeais , and old in piety

Then in full ag-e , and hoary holiness
Retire , great teacher ! to thy promis 'd bliss

Untouch 'd thy tomb , uninjur 'd be thy dust
As thy own fame among the future just

Till in last sounds the dreadful trumpet speaks
Till Judgment calls ; and quicken 'd Nature wakes

Till through the utmost earth , and deepest sea
Our scatter 'd atoms find their destin 'd way

In haste to clothe their kindred souls again
Perfect our state , and build immortal man

Then fearless thou , who well sustain'st the fight
To paths of joy , or tracts of endless light

Lead up all those who heard thee , and believed
'Midst thy own flock , great shepherd , be received

Thy elder look , great Janus , cast
Into the long records of ages past

Review the years in fairest action dressed
With noted white , superior to the rest

^ras derive ! , and chronicles begun
From empires founded , and from battles Avon

Show ail the spoils by valiant kings achieved
And groaning nations by their arms relieved

The wounds of patriots in their country 's cause
And happy power sustain 'd by wholesome laws

In comely rank call every merit forth
Imprint on eveiy act its standard worth

The glorious parallels then downward bring
To modern wonders , and to Britain 's king

With equal justice and historic care
Their laws , their toils , their arms with his compare

Confess the various attributes of fame
Collected and complete in William 's name

Then turn to her fair written page
From dawning childhood to establish 'd age

The glories of her empire trace
Confront the heroes of thy Roman race

The son of Mars reduc 'd the trembling swains
And spread his empire o'er the distant plains

But yet the Sabines ' violated charms
Obscur 'd the glory of his rising arms

Numa the rights of strict religion knew
On ever } ' altar laid the incense due

Unskill 'd to dart the pointed spear
Or lead the forward youth to noble war

Stern Brutus was with too much horror good
Holding his fasces stain 'd with filial blood

Fabius was wise , but with excess of care
He sav 'd his country ; but prolong 'd the war

While Decius , Paulus , Curius , greatly fought
And by their strict examples taught

How wild desires should be controlled
And how much brighter virtue was , than gold

They scarce their swelling thirst of fame could hide
And boasted poverty with too much pride

Excess in youth made Scipio less revered
And Cato dying , seem 'd to own , he feared

Julius with honour tam 'd Rome 's foreign foes
But patriots fell , ere the dictator rose

And , while with clemency Augustus reigned
The monarch was ador 'd ; the city chained

With justest honour be their merits dressed
But be their failings too confessed

Their virtue , like their Tyber 's flood
Rolling its course , design 'd the country 's good

But oft the torrent 's too impetuous speed
From the low earth tore some polluting weed

And with the hlood of Jove there always ran
Some viler part , some tincture of the man

Few virtues after these so far prevail
But that their vices more than turn the scale

Till Heaven a better race of men supplies
And glory shoots new beams from western skies

Turn then to Pharamond , and Charlemain
And the long heroes of the Gallic strain

Experienc 'd chiefs , for hardy prowess known
And bloody wreaths in venturous battles won

From the first William , our great Nonnan king
The bold Plantagenets , and Tudors bring

Illustrious \Trtues , who by turns have rose
In foreign fields to check Britannia 's foes

With happy laws her empire to sustain
And with full power assert her ambient main

But sometimes too industrious to be great
Nor patient to expect the turns of fate

They open 'd camps deform 'd by civil fight
And made proud conquest trample over right

Disparted Britain mourn 'd their doubtful sway
And dreaded both when neither would obey

From Didier and imperial Adolph trace
The glorious ofiFspring of the Nassau race

Devoted lives to public liberty
The chief still dying , or the country free

Then see the kindred blood of Orange flow
From warlike Cornet , through the loins of Beau

Through Chalon next , and there with Nassau join
From Rhone 's fair banks transplanted to the Rhine

Bring next the royal list of Stuarts forth
Undaunted minds that rul 'd the rugged north

Till Heaven 's decrees by ripening times are shown
Till Scotland 's kings ascend the English throne

Janus , mighty deity
Be kind : and , as thy searching eye

Does our modern story trace
Finding some of Stuart 's race

No harsh reflection let remembrance raise
Forbear to mention what thou canst not praise

But as thou dwell'st upon that heavenly name , *
To grief for ever sacred , as to fame

Oh ! read it to thyself ; in silence weep
And thy convulsive sorrows inward keep

Lest Britain 's grief should waken at the sound
And blood gush fresh froni her eternal wound

Whither wouldst thou further look
Read William 's acts , and close the ample book

Describe his youth , attentive to alarms
By dangers form 'd , and perfected in arms

When conq'ring- , mild ; when conquer 'd , not disgraced
By wrongs not lessen 'd , nor by triumphs raised

Superior to the blind events
Of little human accidents

And constant to his first decree
To curb the proud , to set the injur 'd free

His opening years to riper manhood bring
And see the hero perfect in the king

Imperious arms by manly reason swayed
And power supreme by free consent obeyed

With how much haste his mercy meets his foes
And how unbounded his forgiveness flows

With what desire he makes his subjects blessed
His favours granted ere his throne addressed

What trophies o'er our captiv 'd hearts he rears
By arts of peace more potent , than by wars

How o'er himself , as o'er the world , he reigns
His morals strenc-thenincr what his law ordains

Through all his thread of life already spun
Becoming grace and proper action run

The piece by Virtue 's equal hand is wrought
Mixt with no crime , and shaded with no fault

No footsteps of the victor 's rage
Left in the camp where William did engage

No tincture of the monarch 's pride
Upon the royal purple spied

The more shall its intrinsic worth proclaim
Shall pass the combat of the searching flame

Janus , be to William just
To faithful history his actions trust

Command her , with peculiar care
To trace each toil , and comment every war

His saving wonders bid her write
In characters distinctly bright

That each revohing age may read
The Patriot 's piety , the Hero 's deed

And still the sire inculcate to his son
Transmissive lessons . of the king 's renown

That William 's glory still may live
When all that present art can give

The pillar 'd marble , and the tablet brass
Mouldering , drop the victor 's praise

When the great monuments of his power
Shall now be visible no more

WhenSambre shall have chang 'd her winding flood
And children ask , where Namur stood

Jove and Pallas , mighty powers
Guided the hero to the hostile towers

Perseus seem 'd less swift in war
When , wing 'd with speed , he flew through air

Embattled nations strive in vain
The hero 's glory to restrain

Streams arm 'd with rocks , and mountains red with fire
In vain against his force conspire

Behold him from the dreadful height appear
And lo ! Britannia 's lions waving there

Europe freed , and France repelled
The hero from the height beheld

To rescu 'd states , and vindicated crowns
His equal hand prescrib 'd their ancient bounds

Ordain 'd , Avhom every province should obey
How far each monarch should extend his sway

Taught 'em how clemency made power revered
And that the prince belov 'd was truly feared

Firm by his side unspotted Honour stood
Pleas 'd to confess him not so great as good

His head with brighter beams fair Virtue decked
Than those wliich all his numerous crowns reflect

Establish 'd Freedom clapp 'd her joyful wings
Proclaim 'd the first of men , and best of kings

Whither would the Muse aspire
With Pindar 's rage , without his fire

Pardon me , Janus , 't was a fault
Created by too great a thought

Mindless of the god and day
I from thy altars , Janus , stray

The fiery Pegasus disdains
To mind the rider 's voice , or hear the reins

When glorious fields and opening camps he views
He runs with an unbounded loose

Hardly the Muse can sit the headstrong horse
Nor would she , if she could , check his impetuous force

With the glad noise the cliffs and valleys ring
While she through earth and air pursues the king

Slie now beholds him on the Belgic shore
Whilst Britain 's tears his ready help implore

Dissembling for her sake his rising cares
And with wise silence pondering vengeful wars

She through the raging ocean now
Views him advancing his auspicious prow

Combating adverse winds and winter seas
Sighing the moments that defer our ease

Daring to wield the sceptre 's dangerous weight
And taking the command , to save the state

Thoug ' h ere the doubtful gift can be secured
New wars must be sustain 'd , new wounds endured

Through rough lerne 's camps she sounds alarms
And kingdoms yet to be redeem 'd by arms

In the dank marshes finds her glorious theme
And plunges after him thro ' Boyne 's fierce stream

She bids the Nereids run with trembling haste
To tell old Ocean how the Hero past

The god rebukes their fear , and owns the praise
Worthy that arm , whose empire he obeys

Back to his Albion she delights to bring
The humblest victor , and the kindest king

Albion with open triumph would receive
Her hero , nor obtains his leave

Firm he rejects the altars she would raise
And thanks the zeal , while he declines the praise

Again she follows him through Belgia 's land
And countries often sav 'd by William 's hand

Hears joyful nations bless those happy toils
Which freed the people , but return 'd the spoils

In various views she tries her constant theme
Finds him in councils , and in arms the same

When certain to o'ercome , inclin 'd to save
Tardy to vengeance , and with mercy brave

Sudden another scene employs her sig'ht
She sets her hero in another light

Paints his great mind superior to success
Declining : conquest , to establish peace

She brings Astrea down to earth again
And quiet , brooding o'er his future reign

Then with unweary wing the goddess soars
East , over Danube and Propontis ' shores

Where jarring empires , ready to engage
Retard theii * armies , and suspend their rage

Till William 's word , like that of Fate , declares
If they shall study peace , or lengthen wars

How sacred his renown for equal laws
To whom the world defers its common cause

How fair his friendships , and his leagues how just
Whom every nation courts , whom all religions trust

From the Meeotis to the Northern sea
The goddess wings her desperate way

See the young Muscovite , * the mighty head
Whose sovereign terror forty nations dread

Enamour 'd with a greater monarch 's praise
And passing half the earth to his embrace

But her own king she likens to his Thames
With gentle course devolving fruitful streams

Serene yet strong , majestic yet sedate
Swift without violence , without terror great

Each ardent nymph the rising current craves
Each shepherd 's prayer retards the parting waves

The vales along the bank their sweets disclose
Fresh flowers for ever rise : and fruitful harvest grows

Yet whither would th ' adventurous goddess go
Sees she not clouds , and earth , and main below

Minds she the dangers of the Lycian coast
And fields , whei ' e mad Bellerophon was lost

Or is her towering flight reclaimed
By seas from Icarus 's downfall named

Vain is the call , and useless the advice
To wise persuasion deaf , and human cries

Resolv 'd to reach the high empyrean sphere
And tell great Jove , she sings his image here

To ask for William an Olympic crown
To Chromius ' strength and Theron 's speed unknown

Till , lost in trackless fields of shining day
Unable to discern the way

Which Nassau 's virtue only could explore
Untouch 'd , unknown , to any Muse before

She , from the noble precipices thrown
Comes rushing with uncommon ruin down

Glorious attempt ! unhappy fate
The song too daring , and the theme too great

Than in continued annals live , to sing
A second hero , or a vulgar king

And with ignoble safety fly
In sight of earth , along a middle sky

That round his mystic temple press
For William 's life , and Albion 's peace

Till by thy high commands released
Till by thy hand in proper atoms dressed

In decent order they advance to light
Yet then too swiftly fleet by human sight

Nor beaks of ships in naval triumph borne
Nor standards from the hostile ramparts torn

Nor trophies brought from battles won
Nor oaken wreath , nor mural crown

To the victorious monarch 's name
The plenitude of William 's fame

Shut then , auspicious god , thy sacred gate
And make us happy , as our king- is great

Closing the volume of the finish 'd age
( Though noble , 't was an iron page

Bid the great months begin their joyful round
By Flora some , and some by Ceres crowned

Teach the glad hours to scatter as they fly
Soft quiet , gentle love , and endless joy

Lead forth the years for peace and plenty famed
From Saturn 's rule , and better metal named

Secure by William 's care let Britain stand
Nor dread the bold invader 's hand

From adverse shores in safety let her hear
Foreign calamity , and distant war

Betwixt the nations let her hold the scale
And as she wills , let either part prevail

Let her glad valleys smile with wavy corn
Let fleecy flocks her rising hills adorn

Around her coast let strong defence be spread
Let fair abundance on her breast be shed

Where the white towers and ancient roofs did stand
Remains of * Wolsey 's , or great Henry 's hand

Let a young phenix raise her towering head
Her wings with lengthen 'd honour let her spread

August and open , as the hero 's mind
Be her capacious courts designed

Let every sacred pillar bear
Trophies of arms , and monuments of war

Behind , that angel shall be plac 'd , whose shield
Sav 'd Europe in the blow repelled

On the firm basis , from his oozy bed
Boyne shall raise his laurell 'd head

And his immortal stream be known
Artfully waving through the wounded stone

And thou , imperial Windsor , stand enlarged
With all the monarch 's trophies charged

Thou , the fair Heaven , that dost the stars inclose
Wliich William 's bosom wears , or hand bestows

On the great champions who support his throne
And virtues nearest to his own

Round Ormond 's knee , thou tiest the mystic string
That makes the knight companion to the king

Blazon 'd from Bohun 's , or from Butler 's line
He hangs his arms ; nor fears those arms should shine

With an unequal ray ; or that his deed
With paler g'lory should recede

Eclips 'd by theirs , or lessen 'd by the fame
E'en of his own maternal Nassau 's name

Thou smiling see'st great Dorset 's worth confest
The ray distinguishing the patriot 's breast

Born to protect and love , to help and please
Sovereign of wit , and ornament of peace

! long as breath informs this fleeting frame
Ne'er let me pass in silence Dorset 's name

Ne'er cease to mention the continued debt
Which the great patron only would forget

Renown 'd in thy records shall Ca'ndish stand
Asserting legal power , and just command

To the great house thy favour shall be shown
The father 's star transmissive to the son

From thee the Talbot 's and the Seymour 's race
Inform 'd , their sire 's immortal steps shall trace

Happy , may their sons receive
The bright reward , which thou alone canst give

And if a god these lucky numbei 's guide
If sure Apollo o'er the verse preside

Jersey shall at thy altars stand
Shall there receive the azure band

That fairest mark of favour and of fame
Familiar to the Viliiers ' name

Science to raise , and knowledge to enlarge
Be our great master 's future charge

To wi-ite his own memoii-s , and leave his heirs
High schemes of government , and plans of wars

By fair rewards our noble youth to raise
To emulous merit , and to thirst of praise

To lead them out from ease ere opening dawn
Through the thick forest and the distant lawn

Where the fleet stag employs their ardent care
And chases give them images of war

To teach them vigilance by false alarms
Inure them in feign 'd camps to real arms

Practise them now to curb the turning steed
Mocking the foe ; now to his rapid speed

To give the rein , and in the full career
To draw the certain sword , or send the pointed spear

Let him unite his subjects ' hearts
Planting societies for peaceful arts

Some that in nature shall true knowledge found
And by experiment make precept sound

Some that to morals shall recall the age
And purge from vicious dross the sinking stage

Some that with care true eloquence shall teach
And to just idioms fix our doubtful speech

That from our writers distant realms may know
The thanks we to our monarch owe

And schools profess our tongue through eveiy land
That has invok 'd his aid , or blest his hand

Let his high power the drooping Muses rear
The Muses only can reward his care

'T is they that guard the great Atrides ' spoils
'T is they that still renew Ulysses ' toils

To them by smiling Jove 't was given , to save
Distinguish 'd patriots from the common grave

To them , great William 's glory to recall
When statues moulder , and when arches fall

Nor let the Muses , with ungrateful pride
The sources of their treasure hide

The Hero 's virtue does the string inspire
When with big joy they strike the living lyre

On William 's fame their fate depends
With him the song begins : with him it ends

Through various climes , and to each distant pole
In happy tides let active commerce roll

Let Britain 's ships export an annual fleece
Richer than Argos brought to ancient Greece

Returning loaden Avith the shining stores
Which lie profuse on either India 's shores

As our high vessels pass their watery way
Let all the naval world due homage pay

With hasty reverence their top-honours lower
Confessing the asserted power

To whom by fate 't was given , with happy sway
To calm the earth , and vindicate the sea

Our prayers are heard , our masters ' fleets shall go
As far as winds can bear , or waters flow

New lands to make , new Indies to explore
In worlds unknown to plant Britannia 's power

Nations yet wild by precept to reclaim
And teach them arms , and arts , in William 's name

With humble joy , and with respectful fear
The listening people shall his story hear

The wounds he bore , the dangers he sustained
How far he conquer 'd , and how well he reigned

Shall own his mercy equal to his fame
And form their children 's accents to his name

Their reg-al tyrants shall with blushes hide
Their little lusts of arbitrary pride

When William 's virtues raise their opening * thought
His forty years for public freedom fought

Europe by his hand sustained
His conquest by his piety restrained

No long-er shall their wretched zeal adore
Ideas of destructive power

New incense they shall bring , new altars raise
And fill their temples with a stranger 's praise

When the great father 's character they find
Visibly stamp 'd upon the hero 's mind

And own a present Deity confest
In valour that preserv 'd , and power that blest

Through the large convex of the azure sky
( For thither nature casts our common eye

Fierce meteors shoot their arbitrar } ' light
And comets march with lawless horror bright

These hear no rule , no righteous order own
Their influence dreaded as their ways unknown

Through threaten 'd lands they wild destruction throw
Till ardent prayer averts the public woe

But the brig-ht oi ' b that blesses all above
The sacred fire , the real son of Jove

Rules not his actions by capricious will
Nor by ungovern 'd power declines to ill

Fix 'd by just laws he goes for ever right
Man knows his course , and thence adores his light

Janus ! would intreated Fate conspire
To grant what Britain 's wishes could require

Above , that sun should cease his way to go
Ere William cease to rule , and bless below

Urges all that e'er was born
Suatch 'd from her arms , Britannia once must mourn

Yet if our incense can your wrath remove
If human prayers avail on minds above

Exert , great God , thy interest in the sky
Gain each kind Power , each guardian Deity

Let twisted olive bind those laurels fast
Whose verdure must for ever last

Long let this growing ei-a bless his sway
And let our sons his present rule obey

On his Sure virtue long let earth rely
And late let the imperial eagle fly

To Leda 's twins , or he whose glorioiis speed
On foot prevail 'd , or he Avho tam 'd the steed

To Hercules , at length absolv 'd by Fate
From earthly toil , and above envy great

To Virgil 's theme , bright Cytherea 's son
Sire of the Latian , and the British throne

To all the radiant names above
Rever 'd by men , and dear to Jove

Late , Janus , let the Nassau-star
New-born , in rising- majesty appear

Say , dearest Villiers , poor departed friend
( Since fleeting life thus suddenly must end

Say , what did all thy busy hopes avail
That anxious thou from pole to pole didst sail

Ere on thy chin the springing beard began
To spread a doubtful down , and promise man

What profited thy thoughts , and toils , and cares
In vigour more confirm 'd , and riper years

To wake ere morning dawn to loud alarms
And march till close of night in heavy arms

To scorn the summer 's suns and winter 's snows
And search through ever ) ' clime thy country 's foes

Tliat thou mig-htst Fortune to thy side engage
That gentle Peace might quell Bellona 's rage

In vain we think that free-will 'd man has power
To hasten or protract th ' appointed hour

Our term of life depends not on our deed
Before our birth our funeral was decreed

Nor aw 'd by foresight , nor misled by chance
Imperious Death directs his ebon lance

Alike must every state , and every age
Sustain the universal tyrant 's rage

For neither William 's power , nor Marj 's charms
Could , or repel , or pacify his arms

Young Churchill * fell , as life began to bloom
And Bradford 's t trembling age expects the tomb

Wisdom and eloquence in vain would plead
One moment 's respite for the learned head

ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Judges of writings and of men have died
Maecenas , Sackville , Socrates , and Hyde

And in their various turns their sons must tread
Those gloomy journeys which their sires have led

The ancient sage , who did so long maintain
That bodies die , but souls return ag-ain

With all the births and deaths he had in store
Went out Pythagoras , and came no more

And modern Asgyll , * whose capricious thought
Is yet with stores of wilder notions fraught

Too soon convinc 'd , shall yield that fleeting-breath
Which play 'd so idly with the darts of death

Some from the stranded vessel force their way
Fearful of Fate , they meet it in the sea

Some who escape the fury of the wave
Sicken on earth , and sink into a grave

In journeys or at home , in war or peace
By hardships many , many fall by ease

Each changing season does its poison bring
Rheums chill the winter , agues blast the spring

Wet , dry , cold , hot , at the appointed hour
All act subservient to the tyrant 's power

And when obedient nature knows his will
A fly , a grapestone , or a hair can kill

For restless Proserpine for ever treads
In paths unseen , o'er our devoted heads

And on the spacious land , and liquid main
Spreads slow disease , or darts afflictive pain

On curst Piava 's banks the goddess stood
Shew 'd her dire warrant to the rising ' flood

When what a long ' must love , and long must mourn
With fatal speed was urging his return

In his dear country to disperse his care
And arm himself by rest for future war

To chide his anxious friends ' officious fears
And promise to their joys his elder years

Oh ! destin 'd head ; and oh ! severe decree
Nor native country thou , nor friend shalt see

Nor Avar hast thou to wage , nor year to come
Impending death is thine , and instant doom

Hark ! the imperious goddess is obeyed
Winds murmur ; snows descend ; and waters spread

Oh ! kinsman , friend ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Oh ! vain are all the cries
Of human voice ; strong destiny replies

Weep you on earth : for he shall sleep below
Thence none return ; and thither all must go

Whoe'er thou art , whom choice or business leads
To this sad river , or the neighbouring meads

If thou mayst happen on the dreary shores
To iind the object which this verse deplores

Cleanse the pale corpse with a relig'ious hand
From the polluting weed and common sand

Lay the dead hero graceful in a grave
( The only honour he can now receive

And fragrant mould upon his body throw
And plant the warrior laurel o'er his bi'ow

So may just Heaven secure thy future life
From forejg'n dang'ers , and domestic strife

And when the infernal judge 's dismal power
From the dark urn shall throw thy destin 'd hour

When yielding to the sentence , breathless thou
And pale shalt lie , as what thou buriest now

May some kind friend the piteous object see
And equal rites perform to that whichonce was thee

Shine forth , ye planets , with distinguish 'd light
As when ye hallow 'd first this happy night

Again transmit your friendly beams to earth
As when Britannia joy 'd for Anna 's birth

And thou , propitious star , whose sacred power
Presided o'er the monarch 's natal hour

Thy radiant voyages for ever run
Yielding ' to none but Cynthia , and the Sun

With thy fair aspect still illustrate Heaven
Kindly preserve what thou hast greatly given

Thy influence for thy Anna we implore
Prolong one life ; and Britain asks no more

For Virtue can no ampler power express
Than to be great in war , and good in peace

For thought no higher wish of bliss can frame
Than to enjoy that virtue still the same

Entire and sure the monarch 's rule must prove
Who founds her greatness on her subjects ' love

Who does our homage for our good require
And orders that which we should first desire

Our vanquish 'd wills that pleasing force obey
Her goodness takes our liberty away

Let the young Austrian then her terrors bear
Great as he is , her delegate in war

Let him in thunder speak to both his Spains
That in these dreadful isles a woman reigns

While the bright queen does on her subjects shower
The gentle blessings of her softer power

Gives sacred morals to a vicious age
To temples zeal , and manners to the stage

Bids the chaste IMuse without a blush appear
And wit be that which Heaven and she may hear

Minerva thus to Perseus lent her shield
Secure of conquest , sent him to the field

The hero acted what tlie queen ordained
So was his fame complete , and Andromede unchained

Meantime amidst her native temples sate
The goddess , studious of her Grecian 's fate

Taught them in laws and letters to excel
In acting '' justly , and in writing- well

Thus whilst she did hei '' various power dispose
The world was freed from tyrants , Avars , and woes

Since hir 'd for life , thy servile Muse must sing
Successive conquests , and a glorious king

Must of a man immortal vainly boast
And bring him laurels , whatsoe'er they cost

What turn wilt thou employ , what colours lay
On the event of that superior day

In which one English subject 's prosperous hand
( So Jove did will ; so Anna did command

Broke the proud column of thy master 's praise
Which sixty winters had conspir 'd to raise

From the lost field a hundred standards brought
Must be the work of Chance , and Fortune 's fault

Bavaria 's stars must be accus 'd , which shone
That fatal day the mighty work was done

Some demon envying France misled the fight
And Mars mistook , though Louis order 'd right

When thy * young Muse invok 'd the tuneful Nine
To say how Louis did not pass the Rhine

What work had we with Wageninghen , Arnheim
Places that could not be reduc 'd to rhyme

And though the poet made his last efforts
Wurts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â who could mention in heroic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Wurts

But , tell me , hast thou reason to complain
Of the rough triumphs of the last campaign

The Danube rescued , and the empire saved
Say , is the majesty of verse retrieved

And would it prejudice thy softer vein
To sing the princes , Louis and Eugene

And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale
Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale

Tearing of papers , breaking rings a-twain
Storming her world with sorrow 's wind and rain

The carcass of beauty spent and done
Time had not scythed all that youth begun

Nor youth all quit ; but , spite of heaven 's fell rage
Some beauty peep 'd through lattice of sear 'd age

That season 'd woe had pelleted in tears
And often reading what contents it bears

As often shrieking undistinguish 'd woe
In clamours of all size , both high and low

To the orbed earth ; sometimes they do extend
Their view right on ; anon their gazes lend

To every place at once , and , nowhere fixed
The mind and sight distractedly commixed

Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside
Some in her threaden fillet still did bide

And true to bondage would not break from thence
Though slackly braided in loose negligence

Upon whose weeping margent she was set
Like usury , applying wet to wet

Or monarch 's hands that let not bounty fall
Where want cries some , but where excess begs all

Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud
Found yet moe letters sadly penn 'd in blood

With sleided silk feat and affectedly
Enswathed , and seal 'd to curious secrecy

What unapproved witness dost thou bear
Ink would have seem 'd more black and damned here

This said , in top of rage the lines she rents
Big discontent so breaking their contents

The swiftest hours , observed as they flew
Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew

And , privileged by age , desires to know
In brief the grounds and motives of her woe

Her grievance with his hearing to divide
If that from him there may be aught applied

Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage
'T is promised in the charity of age

Not age , but sorrow , over me hath power
I might as yet have been a spreading flower

Fresh to myself , If I had self-applied
Love to myself and to no love beside

That maidens ' eyes stuck over all his face
Love lack 'd a dwelling , and made him her place

And when in his fair parts she did abide
She was new lodged and newly deified

What 's sweet to do , to do will aptly find
Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind

For on his visage was in little drawn
What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn

Whose bare out-bragg 'd the web it seem 'd to wear
Yet show 'd his visage by that cost more dear

And nice affections wavering stood in doubt
If best were as it was , or best without

As oft 'twixt May and April is to see
When winds breathe sweet , untidy though they be

His rudeness so with his authorized youth
Did livery falseness in a pride of truth

What rounds , what bounds , what course , what stop he makes
And controversy hence a question takes

Whether the horse by him became his deed
Or he his manage by the well-doing steed

Accomplish 'd in himself , not in his case
All aids , themselves made fairer by their place

Came for additions ; yet their purposed trim
Pieced not his grace , but were all graced by him

For his advantage still did wake and sleep
To make the weeper laugh , the laugher weep

He had the dialect and different skill
Catching all passions in his craft of will

In personal duty , following where he haunted
Consents bewitch 'd , ere he desire , have granted

And dialogued for him what he would say
Ask 'd their own wills , and made their wills obey

The goodly objects which abroad they find
Of lands and mansions , theirs in thought assigned

And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them
Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them

And was my own fee-simple , not in part
What with his art in youth , and youth in art

Threw my affections in his charmed power
Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower

With safest distance I mine honour shielded
Experience for me many bulwarks builded

Of proofs new-bleeding , which remain 'd the foil
Of this false jewel , and his amorous spoil

To put the by-past perils in her way
Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay

For when we rage , advice is often seen
By blunting us to make our wits more keen

For fear of harms that preach in our behoof
O appetite , from judgment stand aloof

The one a palate hath that needs will taste
Though Reason weep , and cry , 'It is thy last

Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling
Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling

Thought characters and words merely but art
And bastards of his foul adulterate heart

And be not of my holy vows afraid
That 's to ye sworn to none was ever said

For feasts of love I have been call 'd unto
Till now did ne'er invite , nor never woo

Where neither party is nor true nor kind
They sought their shame that so their shame did find

And so much less of shame in me remains
By how much of me their reproach contains

Or any of my leisures ever charmed
Harm have I done to them , but ne'er was harmed

Kept hearts in liveries , but mine own was free
And reign 'd , commanding in his monarchy

Of grief and blushes , aptly understood
In bloodless white and the encrimson 'd mood

Effects of terror and dear modesty
Encamp 'd in hearts , but fighting outwardly

Their kind acceptance weepingly beseeched
With the annexions of fair gems enriched

And deep-brain 'd sonnets that did amplify
Each stone 's dear nature , worth , and quality

Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend
The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend

With objects manifold : each several stone
With wit well blazon 'd , smiled or made some moan

But yield them up where I myself must render
That is , to you , my origin and ender

For these , of force , must your oblations be
Since I their altar , you enpatron me

Hallow 'd with sighs that burning lungs did raise
What me your minister , for you obeys

Works under you ; and to your audit comes
Their distract parcels in combined sums

Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote
For she was sought by spirits of richest coat

But kept cold distance , and did thence remove
To spend her living in eternal love

Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves
She that her fame so to herself contrives

The scars of battle 'scapeth by the flight
And makes her absence valiant , not her might

And now she would the caged cloister fly
Religious love put out Religion 's eye

Not to be tempted , would she be immured
And now , to tempt , all liberty procured

And mine I pour your ocean all among
I strong o'er them , and you o'er me being strong

Must for your victory us all congest
As compound love to physic your cold breast

All vows and consecrations giving place
O most potential love ! vow , bond , nor space

In thee hath neither sting , knot , nor confine
For thou art all , and all things else are thine

Of wealth , of filial fear , law , kindred , fame
Love 's arms are peace , 'gainst rule , 'gainst sense , 'gainst shame

And sweetens , in the suffering pangs it bears
The aloes of all forces , shocks , and fears

To leave the battery that you make 'gainst mine
Lending soft audience to my sweet design

And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath
That shall prefer and undertake my troth

With brinish current downward flow 'd apace
O , how the channel to the stream gave grace

Who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses
That flame through water which their hue encloses

What rocky heart to water will not wear
What breast so cold that is not warmed here

O cleft effect ! cold modesty , hot wrath
Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath

Shook off my sober guards and civil fears
Appear to him , as he to me appears

All melting ; though our drops this difference bore
His poison 'd me , and mine did him restore

Or swooning paleness ; and he takes and leaves
In either 's aptness , as it best deceives

To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes
Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows

And , veil 'd in them , did win whom he would maim
Against the thing he sought he would exclaim

When he most burn 'd in heart-wish 'd luxury
He preach 'd pure maid , and praised cold chastity

Which like a cherubin above them hovered
Who , young and simple , would not be so lovered

Ay me ! I fell ; and yet do question make
What I should do again for such a sake

O , that sad breath his spongy lungs bestowed
O , all that borrow 'd motion seeming owed

Would yet again betray the fore-betrayed
And new pervert a reconciled maid

Therefore I 'll lie with love , and love with me
Since that our faults in love thus smother 'd be

The truth I shall not know , but live in doubt
Till my bad angel fire my good one out

If by me broke , what fool is not so wise
To break an oath , to win a paradise

Then fell she on her back , fair queen , and toward
He rose and ran away ; ah , fool too froward

Celestial as thou art , O do not love that wrong
To sing heaven 's praise with such an earthly tongue

He , spying her , bounced in , whereas he stood
' O Jove , ' quoth she , 'why was not I a flood

A lily pale , with damask dye to grace her
None fairer , nor none falser to deface her

Yet in the midst of all her pure protestings
Her faith , her oaths , her tears , and all were jestings

Was this a lover , or a lecher whether
Bad in the best , though excellent in neither

One god is god of both , as poets feign
One knight loves both , and both in thee remain

Like a green plum that hangs upon a tree
And falls , through wind , before the fall should be

O yes , dear friend , I pardon crave of thee
Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me

Ah , that I had my lady at this bay
To kiss and clip me till I run away

A doubtful good , a gloss , a glass , a flower
Lost , vaded , broken , dead within an hour

So beauty blemish 'd once 's for ever lost
In spite of physic , painting , pain and cost

'Farewell , ' quoth she , 'and come again tomorrow
Fare well I could not , for I supp 'd with sorrow

While Philomela sits and sings , I sit and mark
And wish her lays were tuned like the lark

Sorrow changed to solace , solace mix 'd with sorrow
For why , she sigh 'd and bade me come tomorrow

Pack night , peep day ; good day , of night now borrow
Short , night , to-night , and length thyself tomorrow

It was a lording 's daughter , the fairest one of three
That liked of her master as well as well might be

Long was the combat doubtful that love with love did fight
To leave the master loveless , or kill the gallant knight

But one must be refused ; more mickle was the pain
That nothing could be used to turn them both to gain

Thus art with arms contending was victor of the day
Which by a gift of learning did bear the maid away

On a day , alack the day
Love , whose month was ever May

Spied a blossom passing fair
Playing in the wanton air

Through the velvet leaves the wind
All unseen , gan passage find

That the lover , sick to death
Wish 'd himself the heaven 's breath

'Air , ' quoth he , 'thy cheeks may blow
Air , would I might triumph so

But , alas ! my hand hath sworn
Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn

Vow , alack ! for youth unmeet
Youth , so apt to pluck a sweet

Thou for whom Jove would swear
Juno but an Ethiope were

And deny himself for Jove
Turning mortal for thy love

Take counsel of some wiser head
Neither too young nor yet unwed

'Had women been so strong as men
In faith , you had not had it then

The strongest castle , tower , and town
The golden bullet beats it down

When time shall serve , be thou not slack
To proffer , though she put thee back

Have you not heard it said full oft
A woman 's nay doth stand for nought

Were kisses all the joys in bed
One woman would another wed

Yet will she blush , here be it said
To hear her secrets so bewrayed

Live with me , and be my love
And we will all the pleasures prove

That hills and valleys , dales and fields
And all the craggy mountains yields

There will we sit upon the rocks
And see the shepherds feed their flocks

By shallow rivers , by whose falls
Melodious birds sing madrigals

There will I make thee a bed of roses
With a thousand fragrant posies

A cap of flowers , and a kirtle
Embroider 'd all with leaves of myrtle

A belt of straw and ivy buds
With coral clasps and amber studs

And if these pleasures may thee move
Then live with me and be my love

If that the world and love were young
And truth in every shepherd 's tongue

These pretty pleasures might me move
To live with thee and be thy love

As it fell upon a day
In the merry month of May

Sitting in a pleasant shade
Which a grove of myrtles made

Beasts did leap , and birds did sing
Trees did grow , and plants did spring

Every thing did banish moan
Save the nightingale alone

She , poor bird , as all forlorn
Lean 'd her breast up-till a thorn

And there sung the dolefull'st ditty
That to hear it was great pity

'Fie , fie , fie , ' now would she cry
'Tereu , tereu ! ' by and by

That to hear her so complain
Scarce I could from tears refrain

For her griefs , so lively shown
Made me think upon mine own

Ah , thought I , thou mourn'st in vain
None takes pity on thy pain

Senseless trees they can not hear thee
Ruthless beasts they will not cheer thee

King Pandion he is dead
All thy friends are lapp 'd in lead

All thy fellow birds do sing
Careless of thy sorrowing

Even so , poor bird , like thee
None alive will pity me

Whilst as fickle Fortune smiled
Thou and I were both beguiled

Every one that flatters thee
Is no friend in misery

Words are easy , like the wind
Faithful friends are hard to find

Every man will be thy friend
Whilst thou hast wherewith to spend

But if store of crowns be scant
No man will supply thy want

If that one be prodigal
Bountiful they will him call

And with such-like flattering
'Pity but he were a king

If he be addict to vice
Quickly him they will entice

If to women he be bent
They have at commandement

But if Fortune once do frown
Then farewell his great renown

They that fawn 'd on him before
Use his company no more

He that is thy friend indeed
He will help thee in thy need

If thou sorrow , he will weep
If thou wake , he can not sleep

Thus of every grief in heart
He with thee doth bear a part

These are certain signs to know
Faithful friend from flattering foe

On the sole Arabian tree
Herald sad and trumpet be

Foul precurrer of the fiend
Augur of the fever 's end

Every fowl of tyrant wing
Save the eagle , feather 'd king

That defunctive music can
Be the death-divining swan

That thy sable gender makest
With the breath thou givest and takest

Love and constancy is dead
Phoenix and the turtle fled

Had the essence but in one
Two distincts , division none

Distance , and no space was seen
'Twixt the turtle and his queen

That the turtle saw his right
Flaming in the phoenix ' sight

That the self was not the same
Single nature 's double name

Saw division grow together
To themselves yet either neither

Seemeth this concordant one
Love hath reason , reason none

To the phoenix and the dove
Co-supremes and stars of love

Beauty , truth , and rarity
Grace in all simplicity

Death is now the phoenix ' nest
And the turtle 's loyal breast

Leaving no posterity
'T was not their infirmity

Truth may seem , but can not be
Beauty brag , but 't is not she

To this urn let those repair
That are either true or fair

And to Collatium bears the lightless fire
Which , in pale embers hid , lurks to aspire

And girdle with embracing flames the waist
Of Collatine 's fair love , Lucrece the chaste

To praise the clear unmatched red and white
Which triumph 'd in that sky of his delight

Where mortal stars , as bright as heaven 's beauties
With pure aspects did him peculiar duties

In the possession of his beauteous mate
Reckoning his fortune at such high-proud rate

That kings might be espoused to more fame
But king nor peer to such a peerless dame

Against the golden splendor of the sun
An expired date , cancell 'd ere well begun

Honour and beauty , in the owner 's arms
Are weakly fortress 'd from a world of harms

To set forth that which is so singular
Or why is Collatine the publisher

Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown
From thievish ears , because it is his own

Perchance that envy of so rich a thing
Braving compare , disdainfully did sting

His high-pitch 'd thoughts , that meaner men should vaunt
That golden hap which their superiors want

Neglected all , with swift intent he goes
To quench the coal which in his liver glows

O rash false heat , wrapp 'd in repentant cold
Thy hasty spring still blasts , and ne'er grows old

Which of them both should underprop her fame
When virtue bragg 'd , beauty would blush for shame

When beauty boasted blushes , in despite
Virtue would stain that o'er with silver white

Which virtue gave the golden age to gild
Their silver cheeks , and call 'd it then their shield

Teaching them thus to use it in the fight
When shame assail 'd , the red should fence the white

Proving from world 's minority their right
Yet their ambition makes them still to fight

The sovereignty of either being so great
That oft they interchange each other 's seat

Where , lest between them both it should be killed
The coward captive vanquished doth yield

To those two armies that would let him go
Rather than triumph in so false a foe

Which far exceeds his barren skill to show
Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe

Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise
In silent wonder of still-gazing eyes

Birds never limed no secret bushes fear
So guiltless she securely gives good cheer

And reverend welcome to her princely guest
Whose inward ill no outward harm expressed

Save something too much wonder of his eye
Which , having all , all could not satisfy

But , poorly rich , so wanteth in his store
That , cloy 'd with much , he pineth still for more

Writ in the glassy margents of such books
She touch 'd no unknown baits , nor fear 'd no hooks

Nor could she moralize his wanton sight
More than his eyes were open 'd to the light

Made glorious by his manly chivalry
With bruised arms and wreaths of victory

Her joy with heaved-up hand she doth express
And , wordless , so greets heaven for his success

Doth yet in his fair welkin once appear
Till sable Night , mother of Dread and Fear

Upon the world dim darkness doth display
And in her vaulty prison stows the Day

With modest Lucrece , and wore out the night
Now leaden slumber with life 's strength doth fight

And every one to rest themselves betake
Save thieves , and cares , and troubled minds , that wake

Though weak-built hopes persuade him to abstaining
Despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining

And when great treasure is the meed proposed
Though death be adjunct , there 's no death supposed

And so , by hoping more , they have but less
Or , gaining more , the profit of excess

Is but to surfeit , and such griefs sustain
That they prove bankrupt in this poor-rich gain

That one for all , or all for one we gage
As life for honour in fell battle 's rage

Honour for wealth ; and oft that wealth doth cost
The death of all , and all together lost

In having much , torments us with defect
Of that we have : so then we do neglect

The thing we have ; and , all for want of wit
Make something nothing by augmenting it

Then where is truth , if there be no self-trust
When shall he think to find a stranger just

When he himself himself confounds , betrays
To slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days

No noise but owls ' and wolves ' death-boding cries
Now serves the season that they may surprise

The silly lambs : pure thoughts are dead and still
While lust and murder wake to stain and kill

Th ' one sweetly flatters , th ' other feareth harm
But honest fear , bewitch 'd with lust 's foul charm

Doth too too oft betake him to retire
Beaten away by brain-sick rude desire

Which must be lode-star to his lustful eye
And to the flame thus speaks advisedly

'As from this cold flint I enforced this fire
So Lucrece must I force to my desire

What following sorrow may on this arise
Then looking scornfully , he doth despise

His naked armour of still-slaughter 'd lust
And justly thus controls his thoughts unjust

With your uncleanness that which is divine
Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine

Let fair humanity abhor the deed
That spots and stains love 's modest snow-white weed

A martial man to be soft fancy 's slave
True valour still a true respect should have

Then my digression is so vile , so base
That it will live engraven in my face

To cipher me how fondly I did dote
That my posterity , shamed with the note

Shall curse my bones , and hold it for no sin
To wish that I their father had not bin

Or sells eternity to get a toy
For one sweet grape who will the vine destroy

Or what fond beggar , but to touch the crown
Would with the sceptre straight be strucken down

This siege that hath engirt his marriage
This blur to youth , this sorrow to the sage

This dying virtue , this surviving shame
Whose crime will bear an ever-during blame

Mine eyes forego their light , my false heart bleed
The guilt being great , the fear doth still exceed

And extreme fear can neither fight nor fly
But coward-like with trembling terror die

Might have excuse to work upon his wife
As in revenge or quittal of such strife

But as he is my kinsman , my dear friend
The shame and fault finds no excuse nor end

The worst is but denial and reproving
My will is strong , past reason 's weak removing

Who fears a sentence or an old man 's saw
Shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe

Urging the worser sense for vantage still
Which in a moment doth confound and kill

All pure effects , and doth so far proceed
That what is vile shows like a virtuous deed

Where her beloved Collatinus lies
O , how her fear did make her colour rise

First red as roses that on lawn we lay
Then white as lawn , the roses took away

Until her husband 's welfare she did hear
Whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer

That had Narcissus seen her as she stood
Self-love had never drown 'd him in the flood

Love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth
Affection is my captain , and he leadeth

And when his gaudy banner is displayed
The coward fights and will not be dismayed

Sad pause and deep regard beseem the sage
My part is youth , and beats these from the stage

Desire my pilot is , beauty my prize
Then who fears sinking where such treasure lies

Full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust
Both which , as servitors to the unjust

So cross him with their opposite persuasion
That now he vows a league , and now invasion

That eye which him beholds , as more divine
Unto a view so false will not incline

But with a pure appeal seeks to the heart
Which once corrupted takes the worser part

And as their captain , so their pride doth grow
Paying more slavish tribute than they owe

By reprobate desire thus madly led
The Roman lord marcheth to Lucrece ' bed

Which drives the creeping thief to some regard
The threshold grates the door to have him heard

Night-wandering weasels shriek to see him there
They fright him , yet he still pursues his fear

And blows the smoke of it into his face
Extinguishing his conduct in this case

But his hot heart , which fond desire doth scorch
Puffs forth another wind that fires the torch

And griping it , the needle his finger pricks
As who should say 'This glove to wanton tricks

Is not inured ; return again in haste
Thou see'st our mistress ' ornaments are chaste

He takes for accidental things of trial
Or as those bars which stop the hourly dial

Who with a lingering slay his course doth let
Till every minute pays the hour his debt

And give the sneaped birds more cause to sing
Pain pays the income of each precious thing

Huge rocks , high winds , strong pirates , shelves and sands
The merchant fears , ere rich at home he lands

Hath barr 'd him from the blessed thing be sought
So from himself impiety hath wrought

That for his prey to pray he doth begin
As if the heavens should countenance his sin

And they would stand auspicious to the hour
Even there he starts : quoth he , ' I must deflower

The powers to whom I pray abhor this fact
How can they then assist me in the act

The blackest sin is clear 'd with absolution
Against love 's fire fear 's frost hath dissolution

The eye of heaven is out , and misty night
Covers the shame that follows sweet delight

Thus treason works ere traitors be espied
Who sees the lurking serpent steps aside

But she , sound sleeping , fearing no such thing
Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting

Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head
By their high treason is his heart misled

Which gives the watch-word to his hand full soon
To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon

To wink , being blinded with a greater light
Whether it is that she reflects so bright

That dazzleth them , or else some shame supposed
But blind they are , and keep themselves enclosed

In his clear bed might have reposed still
But they must ope , this blessed league to kill

And holy-thoughted Lucrece to their sight
Must sell her joy , her life , her world 's delight

Swelling on either side to want his bliss
Between whose hills her head entombed is

Where , like a virtuous monument , she lies
To be admired of lewd unhallow 'd eyes

With pearly sweat , resembling dew of night
Her eyes , like marigolds , had sheathed their light

And canopied in darkness sweetly lay
Till they might open to adorn the day

And death 's dim look in life 's mortality
Each in her sleep themselves so beautify

As if between them twain there were no strife
But that life lived in death , and death in life

And him by oath they truly honoured
These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred

Who , like a foul ursurper , went about
From this fair throne to heave the owner out

And in his will his wilful eye he tired
With more than admiration he admired

Her azure veins , her alabaster skin
Her coral lips , her snow-white dimpled chin

His rage of lust by gazing qualified
Slack 'd , not suppress 'd ; for standing by her side

His eye , which late this mutiny restrains
Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins

Nor children 's tears nor mothers ' groans respecting
Swell in their pride , the onset still expecting

Anon his beating heart , alarum striking
Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking

Smoking with pride , march 'd on to make his stand
On her bare breast , the heart of all her land

Whose ranks of blue veins , as his hand did scale
Left there round turrets destitute and pale

And fright her with confusion of their cries
She , much amazed , breaks ope her lock'd-up eyes

Who , peeping forth this tumult to behold
Are by his flaming torch dimm 'd and controlled

Whose grim aspect sets every joint a-shaking
What terror or 't is ! but she , in worser taking

From sleep disturbed , heedfully doth view
The sight which makes supposed terror true

Quick-shifting antics , ugly in her eyes
Such shadows are the weak brain 's forgeries

Who , angry that the eyes fly from their lights
In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights

Wounding itself to death , rise up and fall
Beating her bulk , that his hand shakes withal

This moves in him more rage and lesser pity
To make the breach and enter this sweet city

The reason of this rash alarm to know
Which he by dumb demeanor seeks to show

But she with vehement prayers urgeth still
Under what colour he commits this ill

Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale
Under that colour am I come to scale

Thy never-conquer 'd fort : the fault is thine
For those thine eyes betray thee unto mine

My will that marks thee for my earth 's delight
Which I to conquer sought with all my might

But as reproof and reason beat it dead
By thy bright beauty was it newly bred

All this beforehand counsel comprehends
But will is deaf and hears no heedful friends

Only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty
And dotes on what he looks , 'gainst law or duty

Or stop the headlong fury of his speed
I know repentant tears ensue the deed

Reproach , disdain , and deadly enmity
Yet strive I to embrace mine infamy

Whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies
So under his insulting falchion lies

Harmless Lucretia , marking what he tells
With trembling fear , as fowl hear falcon 's bells

That done , some worthless slave of thine I 'll slay
To kill thine honour with thy life 's decay

And in thy dead arms do I mean to place him
Swearing I slew him , seeing thee embrace him

Thy issue blurr 'd with nameless bastardy
And thou , the author of their obloquy

Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes
And sung by children in succeeding times

For lawful policy remains enacted
The poisonous simple sometimes is compacted

In a pure compound ; being so applied
His venom in effect is purified

The blemish that will never be forgot
Worse than a slavish wipe or birth-hour 's blot

For marks descried in men 's nativity
Are nature 's faults , not their own infamy

Like a white hind under the gripe 's sharp claws
Pleads , in a wilderness where are no laws

To the rough beast that knows no gentle right
Nor aught obeys but his foul appetite

Which blows these pitchy vapours from their bidding
Hindering their present fall by this dividing

So his unhallow 'd haste her words delays
And moody Pluto winks while Orpheus plays

A swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth
His ear her prayers admits , but his heart granteth

No penetrable entrance to her plaining
Tears harden lust , though marble wear with raining

Which to her oratory adds more grace
She puts the period often from his place

And midst the sentence so her accent breaks
That twice she doth begin ere once she speaks

By holy human law , and common troth
By heaven and earth , and all the power of both

That to his borrow 'd bed he make retire
And stoop to honour , not to foul desire

Mar not the thing that can not be amended
End thy ill aim before thy shoot be ended

He is no woodman that doth bend his bow
To strike a poor unseasonable doe

Thou look'st not like deceit ; do not deceive me
My sighs , like whirlwinds , labour hence to heave thee

If ever man were moved with woman moans
Be moved with my tears , my sighs , my groans

For stones dissolved to water do convert
O , if no harder than a stone thou art

Melt at my tears , and be compassionate
Soft pity enters at an iron gate

Thou wrong'st his honour , wound'st his princely name
Thou art not what thou seem'st ; and if the same

Thou seem'st not what thou art , a god , a king
For kings like gods should govern everything

What darest thou not when once thou art a king
O , be remember 'd , no outrageous thing

From vassal actors can be wiped away
Then kings ' misdeeds can not be hid in clay

When they in thee the like offences prove
If but for fear of this , thy will remove

For princes are the glass , the school , the book
Where subjects ' eyes do learn , do read , do look

Authority for sin , warrant for blame
To privilege dishonour in thy name

Thou black'st reproach against long-living laud
And makest fair reputation but a bawd

For it was lent thee all that brood to kill
Thy princely office how canst thou fulfil

When , pattern 'd by thy fault , foul sin may say
He learn 'd to sin , and thou didst teach the way

Their own transgressions partially they smother
This guilt would seem death-worthy in thy brother

O , how are they wrapp 'd in with infamies
That from their own misdeeds askance their eyes

Let him return , and flattering thoughts retire
His true respect will prison false desire

And wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne
That thou shalt see thy state and pity mine

And with the wind in greater fury fret
The petty streams that pay a daily debt

To their salt sovereign , with their fresh falls ' haste
Add to his flow , but alter not his taste

Who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood
If all these pretty ills shall change thy good

Thy sea within a puddle 's womb is hearsed
And not the puddle in thy sea dispersed

Thou loathed in their shame , they in thy pride
The lesser thing should not the greater hide

The cedar stoops not to the base shrub 's foot
But low shrubs wither at the cedar 's root

Instead of love 's coy touch , shall rudely tear thee
That done , despitefully I mean to bear thee

Unto the base bed of some rascal groom
To be thy partner in this shameful doom

When most unseen , then most doth tyrannize
The wolf hath seized his prey , the poor lamb cries

Till with her own white fleece her voice controlled
Entombs her outcry in her lips ' sweet fold

That ever modest eyes with sorrow shed
O , that prone lust should stain so pure a bed

The spots whereof could weeping purify
Her tears should drop on them perpetually

This momentary joy breeds months of pain
This hot desire converts to cold disdain

Pure Chastity is rifled of her store
And Lust , the thief , far poorer than before

The prey wherein by nature they delight
So surfeit-taking Tarquin fares this night

His taste delicious , in digestion souring
Devours his will , that lived by foul devouring

Ere he can see his own abomination
While Lust is in his pride , no exclamation

Can curb his heat or rein his rash desire
Till like a jade Self-will himself doth tire

Like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case
The flesh being proud , Desire doth fight with Grace

For there it revels ; and when that decays
The guilty rebel for remission prays

That through the length of times he stands disgraced
Besides , his soul 's fair temple is defaced

To whose weak ruins muster troops of cares
To ask the spotted princess how she fares

Her immortality , and made her thrall
To living death and pain perpetual

Which in her prescience she controlled still
But her foresight could not forestall their will

The scar that will , despite of cure , remain
Leaving his spoil perplex 'd in greater pain

She bears the load of lust he left behind
And he the burden of a guilty mind

She , desperate , with her nails her flesh doth tear
He faintly flies , sneaking with guilty fear

She stays , exclaiming on the direful night
He runs , and chides his vanish 'd , loathed delight

She prays she never may behold the day
'For day , ' quoth she , 'nights scapes doth open lay

And my true eyes have never practised how
To cloak offences with a cunning brow

To have their unseen sin remain untold
For they their guilt with weeping will unfold

And grave , like water that doth eat in steel
Upon my cheeks what helpless shame I feel

And bids it leap from thence , where it may find
Some purer chest to close so pure a mind

Frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite
Against the unseen secrecy of night

Vast sin-concealing chaos ! nurse of blame
Blind muffled bawd ! dark harbour for defame

Grim cave of death ! whispering conspirator
With close-tongued treason and the ravisher

Make war against proportion 'd course of time
Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb

His wonted height , yet ere he go to bed
Knit poisonous clouds about his golden head

Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick
And let thy misty vapours march so thick

That in their smoky ranks his smother 'd light
May set at noon and make perpetual night

Through Night 's black bosom should not peep again
So should I have co-partners in my pain

And fellowship in woe doth woe assuage
As palmers ' chat makes short their pilgrimage

But I alone alone must sit and pine
Seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine

Mingling my talk with tears , my grief with groans
Poor wasting monuments of lasting moans

Immodestly lies martyr 'd with disgrace
Keep still possession of thy gloomy place

That all the faults which in thy reign are made
May likewise be sepulchred in thy shade

The impious breach of holy wedlock vow
Yea the illiterate , that know not how

To cipher what is writ in learned books
Will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks

Will couple my reproach to Tarquin 's shame
Feast-finding minstrels , tuning my defame

Will tie the hearers to attend each line
How Tarquin wronged me , I Collatine

The branches of another root are rotted
And undeserved reproach to him allotted

That is as clear from this attaint of mine
As I , ere this , was pure to Collatine

And Tarquin 's eye may read the mot afar
How he in peace is wounded , not in war

Alas , how many bear such shameful blows
Which not themselves , but he that gives them knows

Have no perfection of my summer left
But robb 'd and ransack 'd by injurious theft

In thy weak hive a wandering wasp hath crept
And suck 'd the honey which thy chaste bee kept

For it had been dishonour to disdain him
Besides , of weariness he did complain him

And talk 'd of virtue : O unlook'd-for evil
When virtue is profaned in such a devil

Or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts
Or kings be breakers of their own behests

But no perfection is so absolute
That some impurity doth not pollute

But like still-pining Tantalus he sits
And useless barns the harvest of his wits

Having no other pleasure of his gain
But torment that it can not cure his pain

Their father was too weak , and they too strong
To hold their cursed-blessed fortune long

The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
Even in the moment that we call them ours

What virtue breeds iniquity devours
We have no good that we can say is ours

But ill-annexed Opportunity
Or kills his life or else his quality

Whoever plots the sin , thou 'point'st the season
'T is thou that spurn'st at right , at law , at reason

And in thy shady cell , where none may spy him
Sits Sin , to seize the souls that wander by him

Thou foul abettor ! thou notorious bawd
Thou plantest scandal and displacest laud

Thou ravisher , thou traitor , thou false thief
Thy honey turns to gall , thy joy to grief

Thy sugar 'd tongue to bitter wormwood taste
Thy violent vanities can never last

How comes it then , vile Opportunity
Being so bad , such numbers seek for thee

Or free that soul which wretchedness hath chained
Give physic to the sick , ease to the pained

The poor , lame , blind , halt , creep , cry out for thee
But they ne'er meet with Opportunity

Advice is sporting while infection breeds
Thou grant'st no time for charitable deeds

Wrath , envy , treason , rape , and murder 's rages
Thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages

He gratis comes ; and thou art well appaid
As well to hear as grant what he hath said

My Collatine would else have come to me
When Tarquin did , but he was stay 'd by thee

Guilty of incest , that abomination
An accessary by thine inclination

To all sins past , and all that are to come
From the creation to the general doom

Base watch of woes , sin 's pack-horse , virtue 's snare
Thou nursest all and murder'st all that are

O , hear me then , injurious , shifting Time
Be guilty of my death , since of my crime

To endless date of never-ending woes
Time 's office is to fine the hate of foes

To eat up errors by opinion bred
Not spend the dowry of a lawful bed

To wake the morn and sentinel the night
To wrong the wronger till he render right

To ruinate proud buildings with thy hours
And smear with dust their glittering golden towers

To pluck the quills from ancient ravens ' wings
To dry the old oak 's sap and cherish springs

To spoil antiquities of hammer 'd steel
And turn the giddy round of Fortune 's wheel

To tame the unicorn and lion wild
To mock the subtle in themselves beguiled

To cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops
And waste huge stones with little water drops

Would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends
Lending him wit that to bad debtors lends

O , this dread night , wouldst thou one hour come back
I could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack

To make him curse this cursed crimeful night
Let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright

And the dire thought of his committed evil
Shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil

To make him moan ; but pity not his moans
Stone him with harden 'd hearts harder than stones

And let mild women to him lose their mildness
Wilder to him than tigers in their wildness

Let him have time to live a loathed slave
Let him have time a beggar 's orts to crave

And time to see one that by alms doth live
Disdain to him disdained scraps to give

In time of sorrow , and how swift and short
His time of folly and his time of sport

And ever let his unrecalling crime
Have time to wail th ' abusing of his time

Himself himself seek every hour to kill
Such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill

For who so base would such an office have
As slanderous death's-man to so base a slave

That makes him honour 'd , or begets him hate
For greatest scandal waits on greatest state

The moon being clouded presently is missed
But little stars may hide them when they list

The stain upon his silver down will stay
Poor grooms are sightless night , kings glorious day

Gnats are unnoted wheresoe'er they fly
But eagles gazed upon with every eye

Debate where leisure serves with dull debaters
To trembling clients be you mediators

For me , I force not argument a straw
Since that my case is past the help of law

In vain I spurn at my confirm 'd despite
This helpless smoke of words doth me no right

The remedy indeed to do me good
Is to let forth my foul-defiled blood

But if I live , thou livest in my defame
Since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame

And wast afeard to scratch her wicked foe
Kill both thyself and her for yielding so

To make more vent for passage of her breath
Which , thronging through her lips , so vanisheth

As smoke from AEtna , that in air consumes
Or that which from discharged cannon fumes

Yet for the self-same purpose seek a knife
But when I fear 'd I was a loyal wife

So am I now : O no , that can not be
Of that true type hath Tarquin rifled me

A badge of fame to slander 's livery
A dying life to living infamy

Poor helpless help , the treasure stol'n away
To burn the guiltless casket where it lay

To flatter thee with an infringed oath
This bastard graff shall never come to growth

He shall not boast who did thy stock pollute
That thou art doting father of his fruit

Basely with gold , but stol'n from forth thy gate
For me , I am the mistress of my fate

And with my trespass never will dispense
Till life to death acquit my forced offence

To hide the truth of this false night 's abuses
My tongue shall utter all ; mine eyes , like sluices

As from a mountain-spring that feeds a dale
Shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale

To ugly hell ; when , lo , the blushing morrow
Lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow

But cloudy Lucrece shames herself to see
And therefore still in night would cloister 'd be

Why pry'st thou through my window ? leave thy peeping
Mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping

Brand not my forehead with thy piercing light
For day hath nought to do what 's done by night

Old woes , not infant sorrows , bear them mild
Continuance tames the one ; the other wild

Like an unpractised swimmer plunging still
With too much labour drowns for want of skill

No object but her passion 's strength renews
And as one shifts , another straight ensues

Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words
Sometime 't is mad and too much talk affords

Sad souls are slain in merry company
Grief best is pleased with grief 's society

True sorrow then is feelingly sufficed
When with like semblance it is sympathized

Great grief grieves most at that would do it good
Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood

Who being stopp 'd , the bounding banks o'erflows
Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows

My restless discord loves no stops nor rests
A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests

Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears
Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears

So I at each sad strain will strain a tear
And with deep groans the diapason bear

For burden-wise I 'll hum on Tarquin still
While thou on Tereus descant'st better skill

Will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye
Who , if it wink , shall thereon fall and die

These means , as frets upon an instrument
Shall tune our heart-strings to true languishment

That knows not parching heat nor freezing cold
Will we find out ; and there we will unfold

To creatures stern sad tunes , to change their kinds
Since men prove beasts , let beasts bear gentle minds

That can not tread the way out readily
So with herself is she in mutiny

To live or die which of the twain were better
When life is shamed , and death reproach 's debtor

Than they whose whole is swallow 'd in confusion
That mother tries a merciless conclusion

Who , having two sweet babes , when death takes one
Will slay the other and be nurse to none

When both were kept for heaven and Collatine
Ay me ! the bark peel 'd from the lofty pine

His leaves will wither and his sap decay
So must my soul , her bark being peel 'd away

Grossly engirt with daring infamy
Then let it not be call 'd impiety

If in this blemish 'd fort I make some hole
Through which I may convey this troubled soul

Revenge on him that made me stop my breath
My stained blood to Tarquin I 'll bequeath

Which by him tainted shall for him be spent
And as his due writ in my testament

The one will live , the other being dead
So of shame 's ashes shall my fame be bred

For in my death I murder shameful scorn
My shame so dead , mine honour is new-born

By whose example thou revenged mayest be
How Tarquin must be used , read it in me

Myself , thy friend , will kill myself , thy foe
And for my sake serve thou false Tarquin so

Mine honour be the knife 's that makes my wound
My shame be his that did my fame confound

And all my fame that lives disbursed be
To those that live , and think no shame of me

My life 's foul deed , my life 's fair end shall free it
Faint not , faint heart , but stoutly say 'So be it

Yield to my hand ; my hand shall conquer thee
Thou dead , both die , and both shall victors be

Whose swift obedience to her mistress hies
For fleet-wing 'd duty with thought 's feathers flies

Poor Lucrece ' cheeks unto her maid seem so
As winter meads when sun doth melt their snow

For why her face wore sorrow 's livery
But durst not ask of her audaciously

Why her two suns were cloud-eclipsed so
Nor why her fair cheeks over-wash 'd with woe

Her circled eyne , enforced by sympathy
Of those fair suns set in her mistress ' sky

Who in a salt-waved ocean quench their light
Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night

No cause , but company , of her drops spilling
Their gentle sex to weep are often willing

Grieving themselves to guess at others ' smarts
And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts

Is form 'd in them by force , by fraud , or skill
Then call them not the authors of their ill

No more than wax shall be accounted evil
Wherein is stamp 'd the semblance of a devil

Cave-keeping evils that obscurely sleep
Through crystal walls each little mote will peep

Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks
Poor women 's faces are their own fault 's books

Is worthy blame . O , let it not be hild
Poor women 's faults , that they are so fulfilled

With men 's abuses : those proud lords , to blame
Make weak-made women tenants to their shame

By that her death , to do her husband wrong
Such danger to resistance did belong

That dying fear through all her body spread
And who can not abuse a body dead

Those tears from thee , that down thy cheeks are raining
If thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining

Know , gentle wench , it small avails my mood
If tears could help , mine own would do me good

'The more to blame my sluggard negligence
Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense

Myself was stirring ere the break of day
And , ere I rose , was Tarquin gone away

The repetition can not make it less
For more it is than I can well express

And that deep torture may be call 'd a hell
When more is felt than one hath power to tell

Bid thou be ready , by and by , to bear
A letter to my lord , my love , my dear

Bid him with speed prepare to carry it
The cause craves haste , and it will soon be writ

What wit sets down is blotted straight with will
This is too curious-good , this blunt and ill

Much like a press of people at a door
Throng her inventions , which shall go before

If ever , love , thy Lucrece thou wilt see
Some present speed to come and visit me

So , I commend me from our house in grief
My woes are tedious , though my words are brief

Her grief , but not her grief 's true quality
She dares not thereof make discovery

Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse
Ere she with blood had stain 'd her stain 'd excuse

Of her disgrace , the better so to clear her
From that suspicion which the world might bear her

To shun this blot , she would not blot the letter
With words , till action might become them better

When every part a part of woe doth bear
'T is but a part of sorrow that we hear

Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords
And sorrow ebbs , being blown with wind of words

Charging the sour-faced groom to hie as fast
As lagging fowls before the northern blast

Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems
Extremity still urgeth such extremes

And forth with bashful innocence doth hie
But they whose guilt within their bosoms lie

Imagine every eye beholds their blame
For Lucrece thought he blush 'd to her see shame

To talk in deeds , while others saucily
Promise more speed , but do it leisurely

Even so this pattern of the worn-out age
Pawn 'd honest looks , but laid no words to gage

And , blushing with him , wistly on him gazed
Her earnest eye did make him more amazed

The more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish
The more she thought he spied in her some blemish

For now 't is stale to sigh , to weep , and groan
So woe hath wearied woe , moan tired moan

That she her plaints a little while doth stay
Pausing for means to mourn some newer way

For Helen 's rape the city to destroy
Threatening cloud-kissing Ilion with annoy

Which the conceited painter drew so proud
As heaven , it seem 'd , to kiss the turrets bowed

Shed for the slaughter 'd husband by the wife
The red blood reek 'd , to show the painter 's strife

And dying eyes gleam 'd forth their ashy lights
Like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights

The very eyes of men through loop-holes thrust
Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust

Such sweet observance in this work was had
That one might see those far-off eyes look sad

Which heartless peasants did so well resemble
That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble

Their face their manners most expressly told
In Ajax ' eyes blunt rage and rigor rolled

But the mild glance that sly Ulysses lent
Show 'd deep regard and smiling government

That it beguiled attention , charm 'd the sight
In speech , it seem 'd , his beard , all silver white

Wagg 'd up and down , and from his lips did fly
Thin winding breath , which purl 'd up to the sky

As if some mermaid did their ears entice
Some high , some low , the painter was so nice

The scalps of many , almost hid behind
To jump up higher seem 'd , to mock the mind

Another smother 'd seems to pelt and swear
And in their rage such signs of rage they bear

As , but for loss of Nestor 's golden words
It seem 'd they would debate with angry swords

Griped in an armed hand ; himself , behind
Was left unseen , save to the eye of mind

A hand , a foot , a face , a leg , a head
Stood for the whole to be imagined

To see their youthful sons bright weapons wield
And to their hope they such odd action yield

That through their light joy seemed to appear
Like bright things stain 'd , a kind of heavy fear

With swelling ridges ; and their ranks began
To break upon the galled shore , and than

Retire again , till , meeting greater ranks
They join and shoot their foam at Simois ' banks

But none where all distress and dolour dwelled
Till she despairing Hecuba beheld

Staring on Priam 's wounds with her old eyes
Which bleeding under Pyrrhus ' proud foot lies

Of what she was no semblance did remain
Her blue blood changed to black in every vein

Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed
Show 'd life imprison 'd in a body dead

And bitter words to ban her cruel foes
The painter was no god to lend her those

And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong
To give her so much grief and not a tongue

And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong
And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long

And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes
Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies

This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear
Thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here

And here in Troy , for trespass of thine eye
The sire , the son , the dame , and daughter die

Upon his head that hath transgressed so
Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe

For one 's offence why should so many fall
To plague a private sin in general

And friend to friend gives unadvised wounds
And one man 's lust these many lives confounds

Had doting Priam cheque 'd his son 's desire
Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire

Then little strength rings out the doleful knell
So Lucrece , set a-work , sad tales doth tell

To pencill 'd pensiveness and colour 'd sorrow
She lends them words , and she their looks doth borrow

That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent
His face , though full of cares , yet show 'd content

Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes
So mild , that Patience seem 'd to scorn his woes

A brow unbent , that seem 'd to welcome woe
Cheeks neither red nor pale , but mingled so

That blushing red no guilty instance gave
Nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have

That jealousy itself could not mistrust
False-creeping craft and perjury should thrust

Into so bright a day such black-faced storms
Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms

Whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory
Of rich-built Ilion , that the skies were sorry

And little stars shot from their fixed places
When their glass fell wherein they view 'd their faces

So fair a form lodged not a mind so ill
And still on him she gazed ; and gazing still

Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied
That she concludes the picture was belied

And from her tongue 'can lurk ' from ' can not ' took
'It can not be ' she in that sense forsook

And turn 'd it thus , ' It can not be , I find
But such a face should bear a wicked mind

To me came Tarquin armed ; so beguiled
With outward honesty , but yet defiled

With inward vice : as Priam him did cherish
So did I Tarquin ; so my Troy did perish

For every tear he falls a Trojan bleeds
His eye drops fire , no water thence proceeds

Those round clear pearls of his , that move thy pity
Are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city

These contraries such unity do hold
Only to flatter fools and make them bold

So Priam 's trust false Sinon 's tears doth flatter
That he finds means to burn his Troy with water

Comparing him to that unhappy guest
Whose deed hath made herself herself detest

At last she smilingly with this gives o'er
'Fool , fool ! ' quoth she , 'his wounds will not be sore

And both she thinks too long with her remaining
Short time seems long in sorrow 's sharp sustaining

Though woe be heavy , yet it seldom sleeps
And they that watch see time how slow it creeps

By deep surmise of others ' detriment
Losing her woes in shows of discontent

It easeth some , though none it ever cured
To think their dolour others have endured

And round about her tear-stained eye
Blue circles stream 'd ; like rainbows in the sky

These water-galls in her dim element
Foretell new storms to those already spent

Her lively colour kill 'd with deadly cares
He hath no power to ask her how she fares

Both stood , like old acquaintance in a trance
Met far from home , wondering each other 's chance

Sweet love , what spite hath thy fair colour spent
Why art thou thus attired in discontent

Unmask , dear dear , this moody heaviness
And tell thy grief , that we may give redress

She modestly prepares to let them know
Her honour is ta'en prisoner by the foe

While Collatine and his consorted lords
With sad attention long to hear her words

Where no excuse can give the fault amending
In me moe woes than words are now depending

And my laments would be drawn out too long
To tell them all with one poor tired tongue

Where thou was wont to rest thy weary head
And what wrong else may be imagined

By foul enforcement might be done to me
From that , alas , thy Lucrece is not free

And softly cried 'Awake , thou Roman dame
And entertain my love ; else lasting shame

On thee and thine this night I will inflict
If thou my love 's desire do contradict

And swear I found you where you did fulfil
The loathsome act of lust , and so did kill

The lechers in their deed : this act will be
My fame and thy perpetual infamy

I should not live to speak another word
So should my shame still rest upon record

And never be forgot in mighty Rome
Th ' adulterate death of Lucrece and her groom

No rightful plea might plead for justice there
His scarlet lust came evidence to swear

That my poor beauty had purloin 'd his eyes
And when the judge is robb 'd the prisoner dies

Immaculate and spotless is my mind
That was not forced ; that never was inclined

To accessary yieldings , but still pure
Doth in her poison 'd closet yet endure

From lips new-waxen pale begins to blow
The grief away that stops his answer so

But , wretched as he is , he strives in vain
What he breathes out his breath drinks up again

Back to the strait that forced him on so fast
In rage sent out , recall 'd in rage , being past

Even so his sighs , his sorrows , make a saw
To push grief on , and back the same grief draw

Another power ; no flood by raining slaketh
My woe too sensible thy passion maketh

More feeling-painful : let it then suffice
To drown one woe , one pair of weeping eyes

Thine , mine , his own : suppose thou dost defend me
From what is past : the help that thou shalt lend me

Comes all too late , yet let the traitor die
For sparing justice feeds iniquity

With swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine
For 't is a meritorious fair design

To chase injustice with revengeful arms
Knights , by their oaths , should right poor ladies ' harms

Longing to hear the hateful foe bewrayed
But she , that yet her sad task hath not said

The protestation stops . ' O , speak , ' quoth she
'How may this forced stain be wiped from me

My low-declined honour to advance
May any terms acquit me from this chance

The poison 'd fountain clears itself again
And why not I from this compelled stain

The face , that map which deep impression bears
Of hard misfortune , carved in it with tears

'No , no , ' quoth she , 'no dame , hereafter living
By my excuse shall claim excuse 's giving

Till after many accents and delays
Untimely breathings , sick and short assays

She utters this , 'He , he , fair lords , 't is he
That guides this hand to give this wound to me

Of that polluted prison where it breathed
Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeathed

Her winged sprite , and through her wounds doth fly
Life 's lasting date from cancell 'd destiny

Himself on her self-slaughter 'd body threw
And from the purple fountain Brutus drew

The murderous knife , and , as it left the place
Her blood , in poor revenge , held it in chase

Who , like a late-sack 'd island , vastly stood
Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood

Some of her blood still pure and red remained
And some look 'd black , and that false Tarquin stained

And ever since , as pitying Lucrece ' woes
Corrupted blood some watery token shows

And blood untainted still doth red abide
Blushing at that which is so putrified

Where shall I live now Lucrece is unlived
Thou wast not to this end from me derived

If children predecease progenitors
We are their offspring , and they none of ours

Shows me a bare-boned death by time out-worn
O , from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn

And shivered all the beauty of my glass
That I no more can see what once I was

And leave the faltering feeble souls alive
The old bees die , the young possess their hive

Then live , sweet Lucrece , live again and see
Thy father die , and not thy father thee

He falls , and bathes the pale fear in his face
And counterfeits to die with her a space

Till manly shame bids him possess his breath
And live to be revenged on her death

Or keep him from heart-easing words so long
Begins to talk ; but through his lips do throng

Weak words , so thick come in his poor heart 's aid
That no man could distinguish what he said

Held back his sorrow 's tide , to make it more
At last it rains , and busy winds give o'er

Then son and father weep with equal strife
Who should weep most , for daughter or for wife

Replies her husband : 'do not take away
My sorrow 's interest ; let no mourner say

He weeps for her , for she was only mine
And only must be wail 'd by Collatine

I owed her , and 't is mine that she hath killed
'My daughter ' and 'my wife ' with clamours filled

The dispersed air , who , holding Lucrece ' life
Answer 'd their cries , 'my daughter ' and 'my wife

Burying in Lucrece ' wound his folly 's show
He with the Romans was esteemed so

As silly-jeering idiots are with kings
For sportive words and uttering foolish things

To cheque the tears in Collatinus ' eyes
'Thou wronged lord of Rome , ' quoth be , 'arise

Let my unsounded self , supposed a fool
Now set thy long-experienced wit to school

For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds
Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds

Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so
To slay herself , that should have slain her foe

To rouse our Roman gods with invocations
That they will suffer these abominations

Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced
By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased

By all our country rights in Rome maintained
And by chaste Lucrece ' soul that late complained

Her wrongs to us , and by this bloody knife
We will revenge the death of this true wife

Who , wondering at him , did his words allow
Then jointly to the ground their knees they bow

And that deep vow , which Brutus made before
He doth again repeat , and that they swore

And so to publish Tarquin 's foul offence
Which being done with speedy diligence

The Romans plausibly did give consent
To Tarquin 's everlasting banishment

Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him
And like a bold-faced suitor 'gins to woo him

Nature that made thee , with herself at strife
Saith that the world hath ending with thy life

Here come and sit , where never serpent hisses
And being set , I 'll smother thee with kisses

A summer 's day will seem an hour but short
Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport

Being so enraged , desire doth lend her force
Courageously to pluck him from his horse

She red and hot as coals of glowing fire
He red for shame , but frosty in desire

Backward she push 'd him , as she would be thrust
And govern 'd him in strength , though not in lust

And kissing speaks , with lustful language broken
'If thou wilt chide , thy lips shall never open

He saith she is immodest , blames her 'miss
What follows more she murders with a kiss

Even so she kissed his brow , his cheek , his chin
And where she ends she doth anew begin

Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers
So they were dew 'd with such distilling showers

Rain added to a river that is rank
Perforce will force it overflow the bank

Being red , she loves him best ; and being white
Her best is better 'd with a more delight

Which long have rain 'd , making her cheeks all wet
And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt

But when her lips were ready for his pay
He winks , and turns his lips another way

' O , pity , ' 'gan she cry , 'flint-hearted boy
'T is but a kiss I beg ; why art thou coy

Yet hath he been my captive and my slave
And begg 'd for that which thou unask 'd shalt have

Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red
Making my arms his field , his tent my bed

O , be not proud , nor brag not of thy might
For mastering her that foil 'd the god of fight

Look in mine eye-balls , there thy beauty lies
Then why not lips on lips , since eyes in eyes

These blue-vein 'd violets whereon we lean
Never can blab , nor know not what we mean

Fair flowers that are not gather 'd in their prime
Rot and consume themselves in little time

Then mightst thou pause , for then I were not for thee
But having no defects , why dost abhor me

My smooth moist hand , were it with thy hand felt
Would in thy palm dissolve , or seem to melt

Love is a spirit all compact of fire
Not gross to sink , but light , and will aspire

Is love so light , sweet boy , and may it be
That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee

Narcissus so himself himself forsook
And died to kiss his shadow in the brook

Seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty
Thou wast begot ; to get it is thy duty

And so , in spite of death , thou dost survive
In that thy likeness still is left alive

Wishing Adonis had his team to guide
So he were like him and by Venus ' side

Souring his cheeks cries 'Fie , no more of love
The sun doth burn my face : I must remove

I 'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs
If they burn too , I 'll quench them with my tears

And were I not immortal , life were done
Between this heavenly and earthly sun

O , had thy mother borne so hard a mind
She had not brought forth thee , but died unkind

Give me one kiss , I 'll give it thee again
And one for interest , if thou wilt have twain

Thou art no man , though of a man 's complexion
For men will kiss even by their own direction

And now she weeps , and now she fain would speak
And now her sobs do her intendments break

And when from thence he struggles to be gone
She locks her lily fingers one in one

Graze on my lips ; and if those hills be dry
Stray lower , where the pleasant fountains lie

Then be my deer , since I am such a park
No dog shall rouse thee , though a thousand bark

Foreknowing well , if there he came to lie
Why , there Love lived and there he could not die

Poor queen of love , in thine own law forlorn
To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn

'Pity , ' she cries , 'some favour , some remorse
Away he springs and hasteth to his horse

The strong-neck 'd steed , being tied unto a tree
Breaketh his rein , and to her straight goes he

The iron bit he crusheth 'tween his teeth
Controlling what he was controlled with

His eye , which scornfully glisters like fire
Shows his hot courage and his high desire

And this I do to captivate the eye
Of the fair breeder that is standing by

He sees his love , and nothing else he sees
For nothing else with his proud sight agrees

So did this horse excel a common one
In shape , in courage , colour , pace and bone

Look , what a horse should have he did not lack
Save a proud rider on so proud a back

For through his mane and tail the high wind sings
Fanning the hairs , who wave like feather 'd wings

Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels
Beating his kind embracements with her heels

His love , perceiving how he is enraged
Grew kinder , and his fury was assuaged

As they were mad , unto the wood they hie them
Out-stripping crows that strive to over-fly them

For lovers say , the heart hath treble wrong
When it is barr 'd the aidance of the tongue

But when the heart 's attorney once is mute
The client breaks , as desperate in his suit

Taking no notice that she is so nigh
For all askance he holds her in his eye

But now her cheek was pale , and by and by
It flash 'd forth fire , as lightning from the sky

His tenderer cheek receives her soft hand 's print
As apt as new-fall'n snow takes any dint

And all this dumb play had his acts made plain
With tears , which , chorus-like , her eyes did rain

This beauteous combat , wilful and unwilling
Show 'd like two silver doves that sit a-billing

For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee
Though nothing but my body 's bane would cure thee

Then love 's deep groans I never shall regard
Because Adonis ' heart hath made mine hard

For all my mind , my thought , my busy care
Is how to get my palfrey from the mare

The sea hath bounds , but deep desire hath none
Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone

Throwing the base thong from his bending crest
Enfranchising his mouth , his back , his breast

Who is so faint , that dare not be so bold
To touch the fire , the weather being cold

O , learn to love ; the lesson is but plain
And once made perfect , never lost again

For I have heard it is a life in death
That laughs and weeps , and all but with a breath

The colt that 's back 'd and burden 'd being young
Loseth his pride and never waxeth strong

Dismiss your vows , your feigned tears , your flattery
For where a heart is hard they make no battery

Melodious discord , heavenly tune harshsounding
Ear 's deep-sweet music , and heart 's deep-sore wounding

Though neither eyes nor ears , to hear nor see
Yet should I be in love by touching thee

For from the stillitory of thy face excelling
Comes breath perfumed that breedeth love by smelling

Lest Jealousy , that sour unwelcome guest
Should , by his stealing in , disturb the feast

Sorrow to shepherds , woe unto the birds
Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds

Or like the deadly bullet of a gun
His meaning struck her ere his words begun

The silly boy , believing she is dead
Claps her pale cheek , till clapping makes it red

For on the grass she lies as she were slain
Till his breath breatheth life in her again

He kisses her ; and she , by her good will
Will never rise , so he will kiss her still

And as the bright sun glorifies the sky
So is her face illumined with her eye

But hers , which through the crystal tears gave light
Shone like the moon in water seen by night

But now I lived , and life was death 's annoy
But now I died , and death was lively joy

And these mine eyes , true leaders to their queen
But for thy piteous lips no more had seen

That the star-gazers , having writ on death
May say , the plague is banish 'd by thy breath

Which purchase if thou make , for fear of slips
Set thy seal-manual on my wax-red lips

Say , for non-payment that the debt should double
Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble

The mellow plum doth fall , the green sticks fast
Or being early pluck 'd is sour to taste

And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven 's light
Do summon us to part and bid good night

Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace
Incorporate then they seem ; face grows to face

He with her plenty press 'd , she faint with dearth
Their lips together glued , fall to the earth

Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high
That she will draw his lips ' rich treasure dry

Planting oblivion , beating reason back
Forgetting shame 's pure blush and honour 's wrack

He now obeys , and now no more resisteth
While she takes all she can , not all she listeth

Affection faints not like a pale-faced coward
But then woos best when most his choice is froward

Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast
Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last

The which , by Cupid 's bow she doth protest
He carries thence incaged in his breast

He tells her , no ; to-morrow he intends
To hunt the boar with certain of his friends

She sinketh down , still hanging by his neck
He on her belly falls , she on her back

That worse than Tantalus ' is her annoy
To clip Elysium and to lack her joy

The warm effects which she in him finds missing
She seeks to kindle with continual kissing

'Fie , fie , ' he says , 'you crush me ; let me go
You have no reason to withhold me so

Whose tushes never sheathed he whetteth still
Like to a mortal butcher bent to kill

Being moved , he strikes whate'er is in his way
And whom he strikes his cruel tushes slay

The thorny brambles and embracing bushes
As fearful of him , part , through whom he rushes

But having thee at vantage , -- wondrous dread
Would root these beauties as he roots the mead

When thou didst name the boar , not to dissemble
I fear 'd thy fortune , and my joints did tremble

My boding heart pants , beats , and takes no rest
But , like an earthquake , shakes thee on my breast

Distempering gentle Love in his desire
As air and water do abate the fire

Knocks at my heat and whispers in mine ear
That if I love thee , I thy death should fear

Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed
Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head

I prophesy thy death , my living sorrow
If thou encounter with the boar to-morrow

Pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs
And on thy well-breath 'd horse keep with thy hounds

The many musets through the which he goes
Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes

And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer
Danger deviseth shifts ; wit waits on fear

Then do they spend their mouths : Echo replies
As if another chase were in the skies

And now his grief may be compared well
To one sore sick that hears the passing-bell

For misery is trodden on by many
And being low never relieved by any

Applying this to that , and so to so
For love can comment upon every woe

And now 't is dark , and going I shall fall
'In night , ' quoth she , 'desire sees best of all

Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn
Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn

Wherein she framed thee in high heaven 's despite
To shame the sun by day and her by night

Making it subject to the tyranny
Of mad mischances and much misery

Surfeits , imposthumes , grief , and damn 'd despair
Swear nature 's death for framing thee so fair

Are on the sudden wasted , thaw 'd and done
As mountain-snow melts with the midday sun

Be prodigal : the lamp that burns by night
Dries up his oil to lend the world his light

If so , the world will hold thee in disdain
Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain

Foul-cankering rust the hidden treasure frets
But gold that 's put to use more gold begets

For , by this black-faced night , desire 's foul nurse
Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse

For know , my heart stands armed in mine ear
And will not let a false sound enter there

No , lady , no ; my heart longs not to groan
But soundly sleeps , while now it sleeps alone

You do it for increase : O strange excuse
When reason is the bawd to lust 's abuse

Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves
As caterpillars do the tender leaves

Love surfeits not , Lust like a glutton dies
Love is all truth , Lust full of forged lies

Mine ears , that to your wanton talk attended
Do burn themselves for having so offended

Look , how a bright star shooteth from the sky
So glides he in the night from Venus ' eye

So did the merciless and pitchy night
Fold in the object that did feed her sight

Even so confounded in the dark she lay
Having lost the fair discovery of her way

'Ay me ! ' she cries , and twenty times 'Woe , woe
And twenty echoes twenty times cry so

Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe
And still the choir of echoes answer so

Their copious stories oftentimes begun
End without audience and are never done

She says 'T is so : ' they answer all 'T is so
And would say after her , if she said 'No

Who doth the world so gloriously behold
That cedar-tops and hills seem burnish 'd gold

There lives a son that suck 'd an earthly mother
May lend thee light , as thou dost lend to other

Anon she hears them chant it lustily
And all in haste she coasteth to the cry

Like a milch doe , whose swelling dugs do ache
Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake

Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds
Appals her senses and her spirit confounds

Finding their enemy to be so curst
They all strain courtesy who shall cope him first

Like soldiers , when their captain once doth yield
They basely fly and dare not stay the field

Bids them leave quaking , bids them fear no more
And with that word she spied the hunted boar

This way runs , and now she will no further
But back retires to rate the boar for murther

Full of respects , yet nought at all respecting
In hand with all things , nought at all effecting

And here she meets another sadly scowling
To whom she speaks , and he replies with howling

Clapping their proud tails to the ground below
Shaking their scratch 'd ears , bleeding as they go

So she at these sad signs draws up her breath
And sighing it again , exclaims on Death

Who when he lived , his breath and beauty set
Gloss on the rose , smell to the violet

Thy mark is feeble age , but thy false dart
Mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant 's heart

Love 's golden arrow at him should have fled
And not Death 's ebon dart , to strike dead

Now Nature cares not for thy mortal vigour
Since her best work is ruin 'd with thy rigour

But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain
And with his strong course opens them again

But like a stormy day , now wind , now rain
Sighs dry her cheeks , tears make them wet again

But none is best : then join they all together
Like many clouds consulting for foul weather

For now reviving joy bids her rejoice
And flatters her it is Adonis ' voice

To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground
Who is but drunken when she seemeth drowned

The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely
In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly

She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings
Imperious supreme of all mortal things

Then , gentle shadow , -- truth I must confess
I rail 'd on thee , fearing my love 's decease

Grief hath two tongues , and never woman yet
Could rule them both without ten women 's wit

Tells him of trophies , statues , tombs , and stories
His victories , his triumphs and his glories

For he being dead , with him is beauty slain
And , beauty dead , black chaos comes again

Even at this word she hears a merry horn
Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn

Which seen , her eyes , as murder 'd with the view
Like stars ashamed of day , themselves withdrew

So , at his bloody view , her eyes are fled
Into the deep dark cabins of her head

Who like a king perplexed in his throne
By their suggestion gives a deadly groan

This mutiny each part doth so surprise
That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes

No flower was nigh , no grass , herb , leaf , or weed
But stole his blood and seem 'd with him to bleed

Her voice is stopt , her joints forget to bow
Her eyes are mad that they have wept til now

His face seems twain , each several limb is doubled
For oft the eye mistakes , the brain being troubled

Heavy heart 's lead , melt at mine eyes ' red fire
So shall I die by drops of hot desire

The flowers are sweet , their colours fresh and trim
But true-sweet beauty lived and died with him

But when Adonis lived , sun and sharp air
Lurk 'd like two thieves , to rob him of his fair

And straight , in pity of his tender years
They both would strive who first should dry his tears

If he had spoke , the wolf would leave his prey
And never fright the silly lamb that day

Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries
He fed them with his sight , they him with berries

If he did see his face , why then I know
He thought to kiss him , and hath kill 'd him so

And nuzzling in his flank , the loving swine
Sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin

With this , she falleth in the place she stood
And stains her face with his congealed blood

She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes
Where , lo , two lamps , burnt out , in darkness lies

'Wonder of time , ' quoth she , 'this is my spite
That , thou being dead , the day should yet be light

Ne'er settled equally , but high or low
That all love 's pleasure shall not match his woe

The strongest body shall it make most weak
Strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak

It shall be raging-mad and silly-mild
Make the young old , the old become a child

Perverse it shall be where it shows most toward
Put fear to valour , courage to the coward

Sith in his prime Death doth my love destroy
They that love best their loves shall not enjoy

Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood
Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood

She crops the stalk , and in the breach appears
Green dropping sap , which she compares to tears

And so 't is thine ; but know , it is as good
To wither in my breast as in his blood

There shall not be one minute in an hour
Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love 's flower

Holding their course to Paphos , where their queen
Means to immure herself and not be seen

pity the world or else this glutton be
to eat the worlds due by the grave and thee

this were to be new made when thou art old
and see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold

but if thou live rememberd not to be
die single and thine image dies with thee

thy unused beauty must be tombd with thee
which used lives th executor to be

but flowers distilld though they with winter meet
leese but their show their substance still lives sweet

be not self willd for thou art much too fair
to be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir

so thou thyself out going in thy noon
unlookd on diest unless thou get a son

whose speechless song being many seeming one
sings this to thee thou single wilt prove none

no love toward others in that bosom sits
that on himself such murderous shame commits

make thee another self for love of me
that beauty still may live in thine or thee

she carved thee for her seal and meant thereby
thou shouldst print more not let that copy die

and nothing gainst times scythe can make defence
save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence

o none but unthrifts dear my love you know
you had a father let your son say so

or else of thee this i prognosticate
thy end is truths and beautys doom and date

and all in war with time for love of you
as he takes from you i engraft you new

to give away yourself keeps yourself still
and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill

but were some child of yours alive that time
you should live twice in it and in my rhyme

so long as men can breathe or eyes can see
so long lives this and this gives life to thee

yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong
my love shall in my verse ever live young

but since she prickd thee out for womens pleasure
mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure

let them say more than like of hearsay well
i will not praise that purpose not to sell

presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
thou gavest me thine not to give back again

o learn to read what silent love hath writ
to hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit

yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
they draw but what they see know not the heart

then happy i that love and am beloved
where i may not remove nor be removed

then may i dare to boast how i do love thee
till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me

lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
for thee and for myself no quiet find

but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
and night doth nightly make griefs strength seem stronger

for thy sweet love rememberd such wealth brings
that then i scorn to change my state with kings

but if the while i think on thee dear friend
all losses are restored and sorrows end

their images i loved i view in thee
and thou all they hast all the all of me

but since he died and poets better prove
theirs for their style ill read his for his love

yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth

ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds

that i an accessary needs must be
to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me

but do not so i love thee in such sort
as thou being mine mine is thy good report

look what is best that best i wish in thee
this wish i have then ten times happy me

if my slight muse do please these curious days
the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise

and that thou teachest how to make one twain
by praising him here who doth hence remain

lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
kill me with spites yet we must not be foes

hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
thine by thy beauty being false to me

but heres the joy my friend and i are one
sweet flattery then she loves but me alone

all days are nights to see till i see thee
and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me

receiving nought by elements so slow
but heavy tears badges of eithers woe

this told i joy but then no longer glad
i send them back again and straight grow sad

as thus mine eyes due is thy outward part
and my hearts right thy inward love of heart

or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight

and even thence thou wilt be stoln i fear
for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear

to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
since why to love i can allege no cause

for that same groan doth put this in my mind
my grief lies onward and my joy behind

since from thee going he went wilful slow
towards thee ill run and give him leave to go

blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
being had to triumph being lackd to hope

in all external grace you have some part
but you like none none you for constant heart

and so of you beauteous and lovely youth
when that shall fade my verse distills your truth

so till the judgment that yourself arise
you live in this and dwell in lovers eyes

else call it winter which being full of care
makes summers welcome thrice more wishd more rare

so true a fool is love that in your will
though you do any thing he thinks no ill

i am to wait though waiting so be hell
not blame your pleasure be it ill or well

o sure i am the wits of former days
to subjects worse have given admiring praise

and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
praising thy worth despite his cruel hand

for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
from me far off with others all too near

tis thee myself that for myself i praise
painting my age with beauty of thy days

his beauty shall in these black lines be seen
and they shall live and he in them still green

this thought is as a death which can not choose
but weep to have that which it fears to lose

o none unless this miracle have might
that in black ink my love may still shine bright

tired with all these from these would i be gone
save that to die i leave my love alone

o him she stores to show what wealth she had
in days long since before these last so bad

and him as for a map doth nature store
to show false art what beauty was of yore

but why thy odour matcheth not thy show
the solve is this that thou dost common grow

if some suspect of ill maskd not thy show
then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe

lest the wise world should look into your moan
and mock you with me after i am gone

for i am shamed by that which i bring forth
and so should you to love things nothing worth

this thou perceivest which makes thy love more strong
to love that well which thou must leave ere long

the worth of that is that which it contains
and that is this and this with thee remains

thus do i pine and surfeit day by day
or gluttoning on all or all away

for as the sun is daily new and old
so is my love still telling what is told

these offices so oft as thou wilt look
shall profit thee and much enrich thy book

but thou art all my art and dost advance
as high as learning my rude ignorance

then thank him not for that which he doth say
since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay

then if he thrive and i be cast away
the worst was this my love was my decay

you still shall live such virtue hath my pen
where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men

and their gross painting might be better used
where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused

there lives more life in one of your fair eyes
than both your poets can in praise devise

you to your beauteous blessings add a curse
being fond on praise which makes your praises worse

then others for the breath of words respect
me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect

but when your countenance filld up his line
then lackd i matter that enfeebled mine

thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter
in sleep a king but waking no such matter

such is my love to thee i so belong
that for thy right myself will bear all wrong

for thee against myself ill vow debate
for i must neer love him whom thou dost hate

and other strains of woe which now seem woe
compared with loss of thee will not seem so

wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
all this away and me most wretched make

but whats so blessed fair that fears no blot
thou mayst be false and yet i know it not

how like eves apple doth thy beauty grow
if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show

for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds

take heed dear heart of this large privilege
the hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge

but do not so i love thee in such sort
as thou being mine mine is thy good report

or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer
that leaves look pale dreading the winters near

yet seemd it winter still and you away
as with your shadow i with these did play

more flowers i noted yet i none could see
but sweet or colour it had stoln from thee

give my love fame faster than time wastes life
so thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife

then do thy office muse i teach thee how
to make him seem long hence as he shows now

therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue
because i would not dull you with my song

and more much more than in my verse can sit
your own glass shows you when you look in it

for fear of which hear this thou age unbred
ere you were born was beautys summer dead

fair kind and true have often lived alone
which three till now never kept seat in one

for we which now behold these present days
had eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise

and thou in this shalt find thy monument
when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent

finding the first conceit of love there bred
where time and outward form would show it dead

for nothing this wide universe i call
save thou my rose in it thou art my all

then give me welcome next my heaven the best
even to thy pure and most most loving breast

pity me then dear friend and i assure ye
even that your pity is enough to cure me

you are so strongly in my purpose bred
that all the world besides methinks are dead

incapable of more replete with you
my most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue

if it be poisond tis the lesser sin
that mine eye loves it and doth first begin

love is a babe then might i not say so
to give full growth to that which still doth grow

if this be error and upon me proved
i never writ nor no man ever loved

since my appeal says i did strive to prove
the constancy and virtue of your love

but thence i learn and find the lesson true
drugs poison him that so fell sick of you

so i return rebuked to my content
and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent

but that your trespass now becomes a fee
mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me

unless this general evil they maintain
all men are bad and in their badness reign

to keep an adjunct to remember thee
were to import forgetfulness in me

this i do vow and this shall ever be
i will be true despite thy scythe and thee

to this i witness call the fools of time
which die for goodness who have lived for crime

hence thou subornd informer a true soul
when most impeachd stands least in thy control

o thou my lovely boy who in thy power
dost hold times fickle glass his sickle hour

who hast by waning grown and therein showst
thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growst

if nature sovereign mistress over wrack
as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back

she keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill

yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure
she may detain but not still keep her treasure

her audit though delayd answerd must be
and her quietus is to render thee

yet so they mourn becoming of their woe
that every tongue says beauty should look so

since saucy jacks so happy are in this
give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss

all this the world well knows yet none knows well
to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell

and yet by heaven i think my love as rare
as any she belied with false compare

in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
and thence this slander as i think proceeds

then will i swear beauty herself is black
and all they foul that thy complexion lack

and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee
perforce am thine and all that is in me

him have i lost thou hast both him and me
he pays the whole and yet am i not free

let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
think all but one and me in that one will

make but my name thy love and love that still
and then thou lovest me for my name is will

in things right true my heart and eyes have erred
and to this false plague are they now transferrd

therefore i lie with her and she with me
and in our faults by lies we flatterd be

yet do not so but since i am near slain
kill me outright with looks and rid my pain

that i may not be so nor thou belied
bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide

only my plague thus far i count my gain
that she that makes me sin awards me pain

if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
by self example mayst thou be denied

so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will
if thou turn back and my loud crying still

yet this shall i neer know but live in doubt
till my bad angel fire my good one out

i hate from hate away she threw
and saved my life saying not you

so shalt thou feed on death that feeds on men
and death once dead theres no more dying then

for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
who art as black as hell as dark as night

o cunning love with tears thou keepst me blind
lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find

but love hate on for now i know thy mind
those that can see thou lovest and i am blind

if thy unworthiness raised love in me
more worthy i to be beloved of thee

no want of conscience hold it that i call
her love for whose dear love i rise and fall

for i have sworn thee fair more perjured i
to swear against the truth so foul a lie

but found no cure the bath for my help lies
where cupid got new fire my mistress eyes

came there for cure and this by that i prove
loves fire heats water water cools not love

And thou , sad Hour selected from all years
To mourn our loss , rouse thy obscure compeers

Forget the past , his fate and fame shall be
An echo and a light unto eternity

When Adonais died ? With veiled eyes
'Mid listening Echoes , in her paradise

With which , like flowers that mock the corse beneath
He had adorned and hid the coming bulk of Death

Thy fiery tears , and let thy loud heart keep
Like his , a mute and uncomplaining sleep

Will yet restore him to the vital air
Death feeds on his mute voice , and laughs at our despair

Blind , old , and lonely , when his country 's pride
The priest , the slave , and the liberticide

Into the gulf of death ; but his clear sprite
Yet reigns o'er earth , the third among the Sons of Light

Whose tapers yet burn through that night of time
In which suns perished . Others more sublime

And some yet live , treading the thorny road
Which leads , through toil and hate , to Fame 's serene abode

And fed with true love tears instead of dew
Most musical of mourners , weep anew

Died on the promise of the fruit , is waste
The broken lily lies -- the storm is overpast

A grave among the eternal. -- Come away
Haste , while the vault of blue Italian day

Awake him not ! surely he takes his fill
Of deep and liquid rest , forgetful of all ill

Invisible Corruption waits to trace
His extreme way to her dim dwelling-place

So fair a prey , till darkness and the law
Of change shall o'er his sleep the mortal curtain draw

Of his young spirit he fed , and whom he taught
The love which was its music , wander not

Round the cold heart where , after their sweet pain
They ne'er will gather strength or find a home again

See , on the silken fringe of his faint eyes
Like dew upon a sleeping flower , there lies

She knew not 't was her own , -- as with no stain
She faded , like a cloud which had outwept its rain

The wreath upon him , like an anadem
Which frozen tears instead of pearls begem

A greater loss with one which was more weak
And dull the barbed fire against his frozen cheek

And pass into the panting heart beneath
With lightning and with music : the damp death

Of moonlight vapour which the cold night clips
It flushed through his pale limbs , and passed to its eclipse

Of Hopes and Fears , and twilight Phantasies
And Sorrow , with her family of Sighs

Came in slow pomp ; -- the moving pomp might seem
Like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream

Her eastern watch-tower , and her hair unbound
Wet with the tears which should adorn the ground

Pale Ocean in unquiet slumber lay
And the wild Winds flew round , sobbing in their dismay

Or amorous birds perched on the young green spray
Or herdsman 's horn , or bell at closing day

Into a shadow of all sounds : -- a drear
Murmur , between their songs , is all the woodmen hear

For whom should she have waked the sullen Year
To Phoebus was not Hyacinth so dear

Amid the faint companions of their youth
With dew all turned to tears , -- odour , to sighing ruth

Heaven , and could nourish in the sun 's domain
Her mighty young with morning , doth complain

Light on his head who pierced thy innocent breast
And scared the angel soul that was its earthly guest

The ants , the bees , the swallows , re-appear
Fresh leaves and flowers deck the dead Seasons ' bier

And the green lizard and the golden snake
Like unimprisoned flames , out of their trance awake

From the great morning of the world when first
God dawned on chaos . In its steam immersed

Diffuse themselves , and spend in love 's delight
The beauty and the joy of their renewed might

Is changed to fragrance , they illumine death
And mock the merry worm that wakes beneath

By sightless lightning ? Th ' intense atom glows
A moment , then is quenched in a most cold repose

Whence are we , and why are we ? of what scene
The actors or spectators ? Great and mean

Evening must usher night , night urge the morrow
Month follow month with woe , and year wake year to sorrow

A wound more fierce than his , with tears and sighs
And all the Dreams that watched Urania 's eyes

Swift as a thought by the snake memory stung
From her ambrosial rest the fading Splendour sprung

Even as a ghost abandoning a bier
Had left the Earth a corpse . Sorrow and fear

Of stormy mist ; so swept her on her way
Even to the mournful place where Adonais lay

Yielding not , wounded the invisible
Palms of her tender feet where'er they fell

Whose sacred blood , like the young tears of May
Paved with eternal flowers that undeserving way

Revisited those lips , and life 's pale light
Flashed through those limbs so late her dear delight

Leave me not ! ' cried Urania . Her distress
Roused Death : Death rose and smiled , and met her vain caress

That word , that kiss , shall all thoughts else survive
With food of saddest memory kept alive

All that I am , to be as thou now art
But I am chained to Time , and can not thence depart

Dare the unpastured dragon in his den
Defenceless as thou wert , oh where was then

Thy spirit should have filled its crescent sphere
The monsters of life 's waste had fled from thee like deer

Who feed where desolation first has fed
And whose wings rain contagion , -- how they fled

And smiled ! -- The spoilers tempt no second blow
They fawn on the proud feet that spurn them lying low

And the immortal stars awake again
So is it in the world of living men

It sinks , the swarms that dimmed or shared its light
Leave to its kindred lamps the spirit 's awful night

Over his living head like heaven is bent
An early but enduring monument

The sweetest lyrist of her saddest wrong
And love taught grief to fall like music from his tongue

Whose thunder is its knell . He , as I guess
Had gazed on Nature 's naked loveliness

And his own thoughts along that rugged way
Pursued like raging hounds their father and their prey

The weight of the superincumbent hour
It is a dying lamp , a falling shower

The killing sun smiles brightly : on a cheek
The life can burn in blood even while the heart may break

Round whose rude shaft dark ivy tresses grew
Yet dripping with the forest 's noonday dew

He came the last , neglected and apart
A herd-abandoned deer struck by the hunter 's dart

As in the accents of an unknown land
He sang new sorrow ; sad Urania scanned

Made bare his branded and ensanguined brow
Which was like Cain 's or Christ 's -- Oh that it should be so

In mockery of monumental stone
The heavy heart heaving without a moan

Let me not vex with inharmonious sighs
The silence of that heart 's accepted sacrifice

The nameless worm would now itself disown
It felt , yet could escape , the magic tone

Silent with expectation of the song
Whose master 's hand is cold , whose silver lyre unstrung

But be thyself , and know thyself to be
And ever at thy season be thou free

Hot shame shall burn upon thy secret brow
And like a beaten hound tremble thou shalt -- as now

Thou canst not soar where he is sitting now
Dust to the dust : but the pure spirit shall flow

Through time and change , unquenchably the same
Whilst thy cold embers choke the sordid hearth of shame

With phantoms an unprofitable strife
And in mad trance strike with our spirit 's knife

Convulse us and consume us day by day
And cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay

Can touch him not and torture not again
From the contagion of the world 's slow stain

Nor , when the spirit 's self has ceased to burn
With sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn

The spirit thou lamentest is not gone
Ye caverns and ye forests , cease to moan

O'er the abandoned Earth , now leave it bare
Even to the joyous stars which smile on its despair

He is a presence to be felt and known
In darkness and in light , from herb and stone

Which wields the world with never wearied love
Sustains it from beneath , and kindles it above

Sweeps through the dull dense world ; compelling there
All new successions to the forms they wear

And bursting in its beauty and its might
From trees and beasts and men into the heaven 's light

And death is a low mist which can not blot
The brightness it may veil . When lofty thought

Shall be its earthly doom , the dead live there
And move like winds of light on dark and stormy air

Rose pale , his solemn agony had not
Yet faded from him ; Sidney , as he fought

Arose ; and Lucan , by his death approved
Oblivion as they rose shrank like a thing reproved

Rose , robed in dazzling immortality
'Thou art become as one of us , ' they cry

Silent alone amid an heaven of song
Assume thy winged throne , thou Vesper of our throng

As from a centre , dart thy spirit 's light
Beyond all worlds , until its spacious might

And keep thy heart light lest it make thee sink
When hope has kindled hope , and lured thee to the brink

Lie buried in the ravage they have wrought
For such as he can lend -- they borrow not

Who waged contention with their time 's decay
And of the past are all that can not pass away

And flowering weeds and fragrant copses dress
The bones of Desolation 's nakedness

Where , like an infant 's smile , over the dead
A light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread

Pavilioning the dust of him who planned
This refuge for his memory , doth stand

Have pitched in heaven 's smile their camp of death
Welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguished breath

Here on one fountain of a mourning mind
Break it not thou ! too surely shalt thou find

Seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb
What Adonais is why fear we to become

Stains the white radiance of eternity
Until Death tramples it to fragments. -- Die

Flowers , ruins , statues , music , words , are weak
The glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak

A light is past from the revolving year
And man and woman ; and what still is dear

'T is Adonais calls ! Oh hasten thither
No more let life divide what death can join together

Of birth can quench not , that sustaining Love
Which , through the web of being blindly wove

The fire for which all thirst , now beams on me
Consuming the last clouds of cold mortality

Whose sails were never to the tempest given
The massy earth and sphered skies are riven

The soul of Adonais , like a star
Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are

Earning bright spoils for her enchanted dome
Nor thou disdain , that ere my fame become

Its doubtful promise thus I would unite
With thy beloved name , thou Child of love and light

With interlaced branches mix and meet
Or where with sound like many voices sweet

Of moss-grown trees and weeds , shall I be seen
But beside thee , where still my heart has ever been

My spirit 's sleep . A fresh May-dawn it was
When I walked forth upon the glittering grass

Were but one echo from a world of woes
The harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes

So without shame I spake : -- ' I will be wise
And just , and free , and mild , if in me lies

Without reproach or check . ' I then controlled
My tears , my heart grew calm , and I was meek and bold

I cared to learn , but from that secret store
Wrought linked armour for my soul , before

Within me , till there came upon my mind
A sense of loneliness , a thirst with which I pined

The shadow of a starless night , was thrown
Over the world in which I moved alone

Which crushed and withered mine , that could not be
Aught but a lifeless clod , until revived by thee

In thy young wisdom , when the mortal chain
Of Custom thou didst burst and rend in twain

From his dim dungeon , and my spirit sprung
To meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long

Where solitude is like despair , I went.
There is the wisdom of a stern content

And cherished friends turn with the multitude
To trample : this was ours , and we unshaken stood

Which says : -- Let scorn be not repaid with scorn
And from thy side two gentle babes are born

And these delights , and thou , have been to me
The parents of the Song I consecrate to thee

Soon pause in silence , ne'er to sound again
Though it might shake the Anarch Custom 's reign

Reply in hope -- but I am worn away
And Death and Love are yet contending for their prey

And in the light thine ample forehead wears
And in thy sweetest smiles , and in thy tears

And through thine eyes , even in thy soul I see
A lamp of vestal fire burning internally

Whose life was like a setting planet mild
Which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled

Which shake these latter days ; and thou canst claim
The shelter , from thy Sire , of an immortal name

As some lone man who in a desert hears
The music of his home : -- unwonted fears

Like thunder-stricken dragons , for a space
Left the torn human heart , their food and dwelling-place

On his pure name who loves them , -- thou and I
Sweet friend ! can look from our tranquillity

Which wrap them from the foundering seaman 's sight
That burn from year to year with unextinguished light

The peak of an aerial promontory
Whose caverned base with the vexed surge was hoary

The calm ; for sudden , the firm earth was shaken
As if by the last wreck its frame were overtaken

Long trains of tremulous mist began to creep
Until their complicating lines did steep

The forests and the floods , and all around
Darkness more dread than night was poured upon the ground

Glitter and boil beneath : it rages on
One mighty stream , whirlwind and waves upthrown

Into their caves to shriek , come forth , to spy
What calm has fall'n on earth , what light is in the sky

Most delicately , and the ocean green
Beneath that opening spot of blue serene

Earth and the upper air , the vast clouds fled
Countless and swift as leaves on autumn 's tempest shed

The woof of those white clouds , which seem to lie
Far , deep , and motionless ; while through the sky

Its upper horn arrayed in mists , which soon
But slowly fled , like dew beneath the beams of noon

Of what I knew not , I remained : -- the hue
Of the white moon , amid that heaven so blue

Like a great ship in the sun 's sinking sphere
Beheld afar at sea , and swift it came anear

Comes forth , whilst with the speed its frame doth quiver
Sails , oars and stream , tending to one endeavour

Floated , dilating as it came ; the storm
Pursued it with fierce blasts , and lightnings swift and warm

An Eagle and a Serpent wreathed in fight
And now , relaxing its impetuous flight

And hung with lingering wings over the flood
And startled with its yells the wide air 's solitude

The Serpent 's mailed and many-coloured skin
Shone through the plumes its coils were twined within

Sustained a crested head , which warily
Shifted and glanced before the Eagle 's steadfast eye

Its lessening orbs , sometimes as if it failed
Drooped through the air ; and still it shrieked and wailed

The wreathed Serpent , who did ever seek
Upon his enemy 's heart a mortal wound to wreak

A vapour like the sea 's suspended spray
Hung gathered ; in the void air , far away

Like sparks into the darkness ; -- as they sweep
Blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep

Locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil
Until the Eagle , faint with pain and toil

His adversary , who then reared on high
His red and burning crest , radiant with victory

The wind with his wild writhings ; for to break
That chain of torment , the vast bird would shake

Dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings
Then soar , as swift as smoke from a volcano springs

Until the lamp of day was almost spent
It had endured , when lifeless , stark , and rent

With clang of wings and scream the Eagle passed
Heavily borne away on the exhausted blast

Of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere
Of sunset sweep , and their fierce roar to hear

And beautiful , and there the sea I found
Calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound

An icy wilderness ; each delicate hand
Lay crossed upon her bosom , and the band

Upon the sea-mark a small boat did wait
Fair as herself , like Love by Hope left desolate

As brightly it illustrated her woe
For in the tears which silently to flow

Upon the spangled sands , groaned heavily
And after every groan looked up over the sea

From her immovable eyes ; no voice of wail
Escaped her ; but she rose , and on the gale

That opened to the ocean , caught it there
And filled with silver sounds the overflowing air

The pity and the love of every tone
But to the Snake those accents sweet were known

Through the green shadows of the waves that meet
Near to the shore , did pause beside her snowy feet

Of her melodious voice and eloquent mien
And she unveiled her bosom , and the green

For ere the next , the Serpent did obey
Her voice , and , coiled in rest in her embrace it lay

Which cleaves with arrowy beams the dark-red air
And said : 'To grieve is wise , but the despair

With me and with this Serpent , o'er the deep
A voyage divine and strange , companionship to keep

Over the sea with that fierce Serpent go
His head is on her heart , and who can know

And that strange boat like the moon 's shade did sway
Amid reflected stars that in the waters lay

To catch those gentlest winds which are not known
To breathe , but by the steady speed alone

Over the starry deep that gleams below
A vast and dim expanse , as o'er the waves we go

'T was midnight , and around , a shoreless stream
Wide ocean rolled , when that majestic theme

Of love divine into my spirit sent
And ere her lips could move , made the air eloquent

Know then , that from the depth of ages old
Two Powers o'er mortal things dominion hold

Twin Genii , equal Gods -- when life and thought
Sprang forth , they burst the womb of inessential Nought

Sprung from the depth of its tempestuous jar
A blood-red Comet and the Morning Star

In dreadful sympathy -- when to the flood
That fair Star fell , he turned and shed his brother 's blood

In victory , reigning o'er a world of woe
For the new race of man went to and fro

He changed from starry shape , beauteous and mild
To a dire Snake , with man and beast unreconciled

And the great Spirit of Good did creep among
The nations of mankind , and every tongue

In mockery o'er the fane where many a groan
As King , and Lord , and God , the conquering Fiend did own

Numerous as leaves that strew the autumnal gale
Poison , a snake in flowers , beneath the veil

Fear , Hatred , Faith , and Tyranny , who spread
Those subtle nets which snare the living and the dead

In all resorts of men -- invisible
But when , in ebon mirror , Nightmare fell

His reign and dwelling beneath nether skies
He loosens to their dark and blasting ministries

Sprang from the billows of the formless flood
Which shrank and fled ; and with that Fiend of blood

In hope on their own powers began to look
And Fear , the demon pale , his sanguine shrine forsook

Steeping their hearts in the divinest flame
Which thy breath kindled , Power of holiest name

Upon the combat shone -- a light to save
Like Paradise spread forth beyond the shadowy grave

And in each bosom of the multitude
Justice and truth with Custom 's hydra brood

When round pure hearts a host of hopes assemble
The Snake and Eagle meet -- the world 's foundations tremble

The tyrant 's garbage , which to his compeers
The vile reward of their dishonoured years

His triumph dearly won , which soon will lend
An impulse swift and sure to his approaching end

With human blood. -- 'T was many years ago
Since first my thirsting soul aspired to know

Which could not be mine own , and thought did keep
In dream , unnatural watch beside an infant 's sleep

And near the waves , and through the forests wild
I roamed , to storm and darkness reconciled

I wept , sweet tears , yet too tumultuously
For peace , and clasped my hands aloft in ecstasy

A dying poet gave me books , and blessed
With wild but holy talk the sweet unrest

Of our lone mountains : and this lore did sway
My spirit like a storm , contending there alway

The clouds which hide the gulf of mortal woe
To few can she that warning vision show

Like earthquake did uplift the stagnant ocean
Of human thoughts -- mine shook beneath the wide emotion

Which bind in woe the nations of the earth
I saw , and started from my cottage-hearth

And laughed in light and music : soon , sweet madness
Was poured upon my heart , a soft and thrilling sadness

The tempest of a passion , raging over
My tranquil soul , its depths with light did cover

For when I rose from sleep , the Morning Star
Shone through the woodbine-wreaths which round my casement were

But from its beams deep love my spirit drank
And to my brain the boundless world now shrank

The beams of that one Star did shoot and quiver
Through my benighted mind -- and were extinguished never

Of golden clouds which shook the atmosphere
A winged youth , his radiant brow did wear

And bent his eyes of kindling tenderness
Near mine , and on my lips impressed a lingering kiss

And to the shore I went to muse and weep
But as I moved , over my heart did creep

The path of the sea-shore : that Spirit 's tongue
Seemed whispering in my heart , and bore my steps along

And shared in fearless deeds with evil men
Calm as an angel in the dragon 's den

Those hopes had lost the glory of their youth
How sadly I returned -- might move the hearer 's ruth

The Spirit whom I loved , in solitude
Sustained his child : the tempest-shaken wood

His smile divine , when the calm sea was bright
With silent stars , and Heaven was breathless with delight

When thought revisits them : -- know thou alone
That after many wondrous years were flown

By viewless hands , and a bright Star did glow
Before my steps -- the Snake then met his mortal foe

I looked , and we were sailing pleasantly
Swift as a cloud between the sea and sky

Hemming the horizon round , in silence lay
On the still waters -- these we did approach alway

Which girds the pole , Nature 's remotest reign
And we glode fast o'er a pellucid plain

Stood in the midst , girt by green isles which lay
On the blue sunny deep , resplendent far away

'T was likest Heaven , ere yet day 's purple stream
Ebbs o'er the western forest , while the gleam

The thronging constellations rush in crowds
Paving with fire the sky and the marmoreal floods

Girt by the deserts of the Universe
Yet , nor in painting 's light , or mightier verse

That incommunicable sight , and rest
Upon the labouring brain and overburdened breast

Its fretwork in the crystal sea did steep
Encircling that vast Fane 's aerial heap

A glimmering o'er the forms on every side
Sculptures like life and thought , immovable , deep-eyed

Of spell-inwoven clouds hung there to screen
Its blinding splendour -- through such veil was seen

And horned moons , and meteors strange and fair
On night-black columns poised -- one hollow hemisphere

With their own radiance than the Heaven of Day
And on the jasper walls around , there lay

A tale of passionate change , divinely taught
Which , in their winged dance , unconscious Genii wrought

Like mountain snow , mild , beautiful , and blind
Some , female forms , whose gestures beamed with mind

With pale and clinging flames , which ever there
Waked faint yet thrilling sounds that pierced the crystal air

Their own deep fire -- soon as the Woman came
Into that hall , she shrieked the Spirit 's name

Which gathering , filled that dome of woven light
Blotting its sphered stars with supernatural night

Like meteors on a river 's grassy shore
They round each other rolled , dilating more

A cloud of deepest shadow , which was thrown
Athwart the glowing steps and the crystalline throne

The radiance of whose limbs rose-like and warm
Flowed forth , and did with softest light inform

Sinking upon their hearts and mine . He sate
Majestic , yet most mild -- calm , yet compassionate

Looked into mine , like moonlight , soothingly
And a voice said : -- 'Thou must a listener be

They pour fresh light from Hope 's immortal urn
A tale of human power -- despair not -- list and learn

The cloudless Heaven of Spring , when in their flow
Through the bright air , the soft winds as they blow

And where his curved lips half-open lay
Passion 's divinest stream had made impetuous way

And held his hand -- far lovelier ; she was known
To be thus fair , by the few lines alone

None else beheld her eyes -- in him they woke
Memories which found a tongue as thus he silence broke

And the green light which , shifting overhead
Some tangled bower of vines around me shed

And on the twining flax -- in life 's young hours
These sights and sounds did nurse my spirit 's folded powers

Like tokens of the dead : -- but others came
Soon , in another shape : the wondrous fame

Traditions dark and old , whence evil creeds
Start forth , and whose dim shade a stream of poison feeds

False disputants on all its hopes and fears
Victims who worshipped ruin , chroniclers

A throne of judgement in the grave : -- 't was fate
That among such as these my youth should seek its mate

Stifled the captive 's cry , and to abide
That blasting curse men had no shame -- all vied

Like two dark serpents tangled in the dust
Which on the paths of men their mingling poison thrust

The clouds , of Sun and Ocean , who have blended
The colours of the air since first extended

On every heart ; the light which shows its worth
Must among gentle thoughts and fearless take its birth

They sought , and in their helpless misery blind
A deeper prison and heavier chains did find

Terror and Time conflicting drove , and bore
On their tempestuous flood the shrieking wretch from shore

Glide o'er its dim and gloomy strand , had brought
The worship thence which they each other taught

Such refuge after death ! -- well might they learn
To gaze on this fair world with hopeless unconcern

Over their will by their own weakness lent
Made all its many names omnipotent

The air from all its fanes , did intertwine
Imposture 's impious toils round each discordant shrine

In shame and scorn , from groans of crowds made pale
By famine , from a mother 's desolate wail

With the heart 's warfare , did I gather food
To feed my many thoughts -- a tameless multitude

The light of moonrise ; in the northern Heaven
Among the clouds near the horizon driven

Looked vast in twilight , and the sorrowing gale
Waked in those ruins gray its everlasting wail

And monuments of less ungentle creeds
Tell their own tale to him who wisely heeds

The bright stars shining in the breathless sea
Interpreted those scrolls of mortal mystery

Have stamped the sign of power -- I felt the sway
Of the vast stream of ages bear away

Of the still moon , my spirit onward passed
Beneath truth 's steady beams upon its tumult cast

Justice and Truth their winged child have found
Awake ! arise ! until the mighty sound

Hide the last altar 's unregarded dust
Whose Idol has so long betrayed your impious trust

The swoon of ages , it shall burst and fill
The world with cleansing fire ; it must , it will

But Laon ? on high Freedom 's desert land
A tower whose marble walls the leagued storms withstand

And ever from that hour upon me lay
The burden of this hope , and night or day

To the lone shores and mountains , 't was a guest
Which followed where I fled , and watched when I did rest

Which ruled me now -- and as the vapours lie
Bright in the outspread morning 's radiancy

On which its lustre streamed , whene'er it might
Through darkness wide and deep those tranced spirits smite

And hear his breath its own swift gaspings smother
Even as my words evoked them -- and another

And the cold truth such sad reverse did seem
As to awake in grief from some delightful dream

Round whose worn base the wild waves hiss and leap
Resting at eve , a lofty converse keep

Tears which are lies , and could betray and spread
Snares for that guileless heart which for his own had bled

For to tread life 's dismaying wilderness
Without one smile to cheer , one voice to bless

With love that scorned return sought to unbind
The interwoven clouds which make its wisdom blind

As from a mine of magic store , I drew
Words which were weapons ; -- round my heart there grew

Sprang forth -- yet not alone from wisdom 's tower
A minister of truth , these plumes young Laon bore

Aught human thing beneath Heaven 's mighty dome
Beyond this child ; so when sad hours were come

Heartless and false , I turned from all , to be
Cythna , the only source of tears and smiles to thee

Even then , methought , with the world 's tyrant rage
A patient warfare thy young heart did wage

To overflow with tears , or converse fraught
With passion , o'er their depths its fleeting light had wrought

Most like some radiant cloud of morning dew
Which wanders through the waste air 's pathless blue

Like the bright shade of some immortal dream
Which walks , when tempest sleeps , the wave of life 's dark stream

All those steep paths which languor and despair
Of human things , had made so dark and bare

Knew I what solace for that loss was left
Though by a bitter wound my trusting heart was cleft

My sole associate , and her willing feet
Wandered with mine where earth and ocean meet

Through forests wild and old , and lawny dells
Where boughs of incense droop over the emerald wells

It had no waste but some memorial lent
Which strung me to my toil -- some monument

Would rest , with looks entreating to abide
Too earnest and too sweet ever to be denied

And when the pauses of the lulling air
Of noon beside the sea had made a lair

While , as the shifting visions over her swept
Amid her innocent rest by turns she smiled and wept

Whom sunset wakens , fill the shore and sky
With her sweet accents , a wild melody

Triumphant strains , which , like a spirit 's tongue
To the enchanted waves that child of glory sung

Of those impassioned songs , when Cythna sate
Amid the calm which rapture doth create

From her deep eyes far wandering , on the wing
Of visions that were mine , beyond its utmost spring

Where'er they trod the darkness to disperse
The cloud of that unutterable curse

Earth , sea and sky , the planets , life and fame
And fate , or whate'er else binds the world 's wondrous frame

Hers too were all my thoughts , ere yet , endowed
With music and with light , their fountains flowed

Within , was turned on mine with speechless grace
Watching the hopes which there her heart had learned to trace

Left in the human world few mysteries
How without fear of evil or disguise

Yet melt in tenderness ! what genius wild
Yet mighty , was enclosed within one simple child

To burst the chains which life for ever flings
On the entangled soul 's aspiring wings

Evil , like blight , on man , who , still betrayed
Laughs o'er the grave in which his living hopes are laid

Unconscious of the power through which she wrought
The woof of such intelligible thought

Why the deceiver and the slave has sway
O'er heralds so divine of truth 's arising day

But else , from the wide earth 's maternal breast
Victorious Evil , which had dispossessed

And minister to lust its joys forlorn
Till they had learned to breathe the atmosphere of scorn

Thus , Cythna mourned with me the servitude
In which the half of humankind were mewed

To the hyena lust , who , among graves
Over his loathed meal , laughing in agony , raves

Never will peace and human nature meet
Till free and equal man and woman greet

This slavery must be broken ' -- as I spake
From Cythna 's eyes a light of exultation brake

If she should lead a happy female train
To meet thee over the rejoicing plain

My arm upon her tremulous heart , and wound
Her own about my neck , till some reply she found

With thee , if thou desirest , will I seek
Through their array of banded slaves to wreak

To scorn and shame , and this beloved spot
And thee , O dearest friend , to leave and murmur not

Through which I seek , by most resembling thee
So to become most good and great and free

Who , could they see thine eyes , or feel such lore
As I have learnt from them , like me would fear no more

Was saved , because in accents sweet and low
He sung a song his Judge loved long ago

Hearts beat as mine now beats , with such intent
As renovates the world ; a will omnipotent

Woman with some vile slave her tyrant dwells
There with the music of thine own sweet spells

Of thy deep spirit , reason 's mighty lore
And power shall then abound , and hope arise once more

Can they whose mates are beasts , condemned to bear
Scorn , heavier far than toil or anguish , dare

The shape of woman -- hoary Crime would come
Behind , and Fraud rebuild religion 's tottering dome

Millions of slaves from many a dungeon damp
Shall leap in joy , as the benumbing cramp

Has fixed , as an invulnerable charm
Upon her children 's brow , dark Falsehood to disarm

Amid the dwellers of this lonely land
I shall remain alone -- and thy command

Borne on the storm , its millions shall advance
Thronging round thee , the light of their deliverance

Of broadest floods might quench , shall all the kinds
Of evil , catch from our uniting minds

Her childhood now , and through the paths of men
Will pass , as the charmed bird that haunts the serpent 's den

The agony of this thought ? ' -- As thus she spoke
The gathered sobs her quivering accents broke

As one awakes from sleep , and wildly pressed
My bosom , her whole frame impetuously possessed

We might survive all ills in one caress
Nor doth the grave -- I fear 't is passionless

Our memory , and whose hopes its light retain
When these dissevered bones are trodden in the plain

So we arose , and by the starlight steep
Went homeward -- neither did we speak nor weep

We moved towards our home ; where , in this mood
Each from the other sought refuge in solitude

Of waking life , the visions of a dream
Which hid in one dim gulf the troubled stream

And I lay struggling as its whirlwinds passed
Sometimes for rapture sick , sometimes for pain aghast

When the third came , like mist on breezes curled
From my dim sleep a shadow was unfurled

With dew from the wild streamlet 's shattered wave
Hung , where we sate to taste the joys which Nature gave

Intenser hues , so that the herbless stone
The leafless bough among the leaves alone

In this strange vision , so divine to me
That if I loved before , now love was agony

With our repose a nameless sense of fear
And from the cave behind I seemed to hear

A tumult and a rush of thronging feet
The cavern 's secret depths beneath the earth did beat

And the winds bore me -- through the darkness spread
Around , the gaping earth then vomited

They plucked at Cythna -- soon to me then clung
A sense of actual things those monstrous dreams among

To its dire wanderings to adapt the sound
Which in the light of morn was poured around

With armed men , whose glittering swords were bare
And whose degraded limbs the tyrant 's garb did wear

Arrested me -- my mien grew calm and meek
And grasping a small knife , I went to seek

Its whirlwind rage : -- so I passed quietly
Till I beheld , where bound , that dearest child did lie

Of the calm smile with which she looked on me
So that I feared some brainless ecstasy

'At first my peace was marred by this strange stir
Now I am calm as truth -- its chosen minister

The slavery where they drag me now , to share
And among captives willing chains to wear

Which would ensnare us now , for in the end
In victory or in death our hopes and fears must blend

Around her , for their comrades just withdrew
To guard some other victim -- so I drew

And grasped a fourth by the throat , and with loud cry
My countrymen invoked to death or liberty

I felt that they had bound me in my swoon
And up a rock which overhangs the town

The vineyards and the harvests , and the glow
Of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white Ocean 's flow

Of distant seas , from ages long gone by
Had made a landmark ; o'er its height to fly

On Earth and Ocean , its carved summits cast
The sunken daylight far through the aerial waste

A vessel from the putrid pool ; one bare
A lighted torch , and four with friendless care

We wound , until the torch 's fiery tongue
Amid the gushing day beamless and pallid hung

As to its ponderous and suspended mass
With chains which eat into the flesh , alas

With horrid clangour fell , and the far sound
Of their retiring steps in the dense gloom was drowned

The darkness of brief frenzy cast on me
So that I knew not my own misery

The town among the woods below that lay
And the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay

No shadow in the sky beside mine own
Mine , and the shadow of my chain alone

In that broad glare ; yet sound to me none came
But of the living blood that ran within my frame

Its shadow lay beyond -- that sight again
Waked , with its presence , in my tranced brain

Of waters , to her blighting slavery sold
And watched it with such thoughts as must remain untold

It moved a speck upon the Ocean dark
Soon the wan stars came forth , and I could mark

I would have risen , but ere that I could rise
My parched skin was split with piercing agonies

Forgive me , if , reserved for victory
The Champion of thy faith e'er sought to fly.

Into my soul -- linked remembrance lent
To that such power , to me such a severe content

Moved over me , nor though in evening dun
Or when the stars their visible courses run

Its presence , nor seek refuge with the dead
From one faint hope whose flower a dropping poison shed

The water-vessel , while despair possessed
My thoughts , and now no drop remained ! The uprest

Fuel , not food . I chewed the bitter dust
And bit my bloodless arm , and licked the brazen rust

Of the riven soul , sent its foul dreams to sweep
With whirlwind swiftness -- a fall far and deep

Their watch in some dim charnel 's loneliness
A shoreless sea , a sky sunless and planetless

Legions seemed gathering from the misty levels
Of Ocean , to supply those ceaseless revels

Which so bemocked themselves , that I descried
All shapes like mine own self , hideously multiplied

Was not a phantom of the realms accursed
Where then my spirit dwelt -- but of the first

In hues which , when through memory 's waste they flow
Make their divided streams more bright and rapid now

Hung them on high by the entangled hair
Swarthy were three -- the fourth was very fair

Leaning that I might eat , I stretched and clung
Over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung

To my dry lips -- what radiance did inform
Those horny eyes ? whose was that withered form

Within my teeth ! -- a whirlwind keen as frost
Then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed

On the verge of formless space -- it languished there
And dying , left a silence lone and drear

Stately and beautiful ; that dreadful sleep
His heavenly smiles dispersed , and I could wake and weep

My vitals , I rejoiced , as if the boon
Of senseless death would be accorded soon

The midnight pines ; the grate did then unclose
And on that reverend form the moonlight did repose

To answer those kind looks ; he did enfold
His giant arms around me , to uphold

As dew to drooping leaves ; -- the chain , with sound
Like earthquake , through the chasm of that steep stair did bound

My hair ; -- I looked abroad , and saw a star
Shining beside a sail , and distant far

So that I feared some Spirit , fell and dark
In trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark

For my light head was hollowed in his lap
And my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap

Those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent
And to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent

His zone in the dim sea -- now cheeringly
Though he said little , did he speak to me

I joyed as those a human tone to hear
Who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year

The stars of night grew pallid , and the beams
Of morn descended on the ocean-streams

To hang in hope over a dying child
Till in the azure East darkness again was piled

Were cut by its keen keel , though slantingly
Soon I could hear the leaves sigh , and could see

On sidelong wing , into a silent cove
Where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove

With blooming ivy-trails was overgrown
Upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown

Within the walls of that gray tower , which stood
A changeling of man 's art nursed amid Nature 's brood

And bore me through the tower adown a stair
Whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear

Was tapestried , where me his soft hands placed
Upon a couch of grass and oak-leaves interlaced

The old man opened them ; the moonlight lay
Upon a lake whose waters wove their play

The antique sculptured roof , and many a tome
Whose lore had made that sage all that he had become

And snowy mountains : -- did my spirit wake
From sleep as many-coloured as the snake

Was Cythna then a dream , and all my youth
And all its hopes and fears , and all its joy and ruth

That gentle Hermit , in my helpless woe
By my sick couch was busy to and fro

The wonders of his sylvan solitude
And we together sate by that isle-fretted flood

That thrilling name had ceased to make me start
From his familiar lips -- it was not art

A glance as keen as is the lightning 's stroke
When it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak

Then I bethought me of the glorious doom
Of those who sternly struggle to relume

Of eve , to that friend 's heart I told my thought
That heart which had grown old , but had corrupted not

When they are gone into the senseless damp
Of graves ; -- his spirit thus became a lamp

Deep thirst for knowledge had his footsteps led
And all the ways of men among mankind he read

Which made them abject , would preserve them so
And in such faith , some steadfast joy to know

Torture for liberty , and that the crowd
High truths from gifted lips had heard and understood

But to the land on which the victor 's flame
Had fed , my native land , the Hermit came

Rallied their secret hopes , though tyrants sung
Hymns of triumphant joy our scattered tribes among

And made them melt in tears of penitence
They gave him entrance free to bear me thence

Has crept ; the hope which wildered it has lent
Meanwhile , to me the power of a sublime intent

Out of the hopes of thine aspirings bold
Have I collected language to unfold

They have been heard , and men aspire to more
Than they have ever gained or ever lost of yore

And vows of faith each to the other bind
And marriageable maidens , who have pined

And every bosom thus is rapt and shook
Like autumn 's myriad leaves in one swoln mountain-brook

The lies of their own heart , but when one meets
Another at the shrine , he inly weets

And gold grows vile even to the wealthy crone
And laughter fills the Fane , and curses shake the Throne

To faiths which long have held the world in awe
Bloody and false , and cold : -- as whirlpools draw

This hope , compels all spirits to obey
Which round thy secret strength now throng in wide array

To me , to all , the power to advance
Towards this unforeseen deliverance

Nor change may not extinguish , and my share
Of good , was o'er the world its gathered beams to bear

In seeming , and the hopes which inly dwell
My manners note that I did long repel

And tempests , and his soul-subduing tongue
Were as a lance to quell the mailed crest of wrong

Of words -- for lately did a maiden fair
Who from her childhood has been taught to bear

And with these quiet words -- '' for thine own sake
I prithee spare me ; '' -- did with ruth so take

One human hand to harm her -- unassailed
Therefore she walks through the great City , veiled

And blending , in the smiles of that defence
The Serpent and the Dove , Wisdom and Innocence

Or the caresses of his sated lust
They congregate : -- in her they put their trust

Caught by some forest , bend beneath the spell
Of that young maiden 's speech , and to their chiefs rebel

For those fair hands now free , while armed wrong
Trembles before her look , though it be strong

Lovers renew the vows which they did plight
In early faith , and hearts long parted now unite

Thrusts the redemption of its wickedness
In squalid huts , and in its palaces

All evil , and her foes relenting turn
And cast the vote of love in hope 's abandoned urn

Men make them arms to hurl down tyranny
False arbiter between the bound and free

And throng in arms ; but tyranny disowns
Their claim , and gathers strength around its trembling thrones

Custom , with iron mace points to the graves
Where her own standard desolately waves

Her path with human hearts , '' and o'er it flings
The wildering gloom of her immeasurable wings

Ten thousand standards wide , they load the blast
Which bears one sound of many voices past

And that his power hath passed away , doth know
Why pause the victor swords to seal his overthrow

Carnage and ruin have been made their food
From infancy -- ill has become their good

Surrounding them , with words of human love
Seek from their own decay their stubborn minds to move

The thoughts of men with hope ; as when the sound
Of whirlwind , whose fierce blasts the waves and clouds confound

The conquerors pause , and oh ! may freemen ne'er
Clasp the relentless knees of Dread , the murderer

Pour on those evil men the love that lies
Hovering within those spirit-soothing eyes

As one out of dim dreams that doth awake
And looked upon the depth of that reposing lake

Was prematurely gray , my face was lined
With channels , such as suffering leaves behind

Their food and dwelling ; though mine eyes might speak
A subtle mind and strong within a frame thus weak

The brightest woof of genius , still was seen
One who , methought , had gone from the world 's scene

The mirror of her thoughts , and still the grace
Which her mind 's shadow cast , left there a lingering trace

Which steeped its skirts in gold ? or , dark and lone
Doth it not through the paths of night unknown

When the cold moon sharpens her silver horn
Under the sea , and make the wide night not forlorn

My war . O'er many a mountain-chain which rears
Its hundred crests aloft , my spirit bears

The blosmy spring 's star-bright investiture
A vision which aught sad from sadness might allure

At night when I reposed , fair dreams did pass
Before my pillow ; -- my own Cythna was

That gentlest sleep seemed from my life to sever
As if the light of youth were not withdrawn for ever

Haunted my thoughts. -- Ah , Hope its sickness feeds
With whatsoe'er it finds , or flowers or weeds

Why was this hope not torture ? Yet it made
A light around my steps which would not ever fade

The plain , the City , and the Camp below
Skirted the midnight Ocean 's glimmering flow

And fires blazed far amid the scattered camps
Like springs of flame , which burst where'er swift Earthquake stamps

Made silence more profound. -- Oh , what a might
Of human thought was cradled in that night

Evil and good , in woven passions mailed
Waged through that silent throng -- a war that never failed

In innocent sleep , exultingly I went
The moon had left Heaven desert now , but lent

His downward face. -- ' A friend ! ' I cried aloud
And quickly common hopes made freemen understood

Which led us forth , until the stars grew dim
And all the while , methought , his voice did swim

At last , when daylight 'gan to fill the air
He looked on me , and cried in wonder -- 'Thou art here

And thoughtless pride his love in silence bound
And shame and sorrow mine in toils had wound

Tears of repenting joy , which fast intruded
Fell fast , and o'er its peace our mingling spirits brooded

From every tent roused by that clamour dread
Our bands outsprung and seized their arms -- we sped

Stabbed in their sleep , trampled in treacherous war
The gentle hearts whose power their lives had sought to spare

They rage among the camp ; -- they overbear
The patriot hosts -- confusion , then despair

The slaves , and widening through the vaulted sky
Seemed sent from Earth to Heaven in sign of victory

Their shattered ranks , and in a craggy vale
Where even their fierce despair might nought avail

One pointed on his foe the mortal spear
I rushed before its point , and cried 'Forbear , forbear

With eloquence which shall not be withstood
Flow thus ! ' I cried in joy , 'thou vital flood

Ah , ye are pale , -- ye weep , -- your passions pause
'T is well ! ye feel the truth of love 's benignant laws

Which ye might suffer , there were eyes to weep
But ye have quenched them -- there were smiles to steep

Around your tents , truth 's freedom to bestow
Ye stabbed as they did sleep -- but they forgive ye now

For hire , are men ; and to avenge misdeed
On the misdoer , doth but Misery feed

And all that lives , or is , to be hath given
Even as to thee have these done ill , and are forgiven

My sense with dimness , for the wound , which bled
Freshly , swift shadows o'er mine eyes had shed

The light of questioning looks , whilst one did close
My wound with balmiest herbs , and soothed me to repose

Gone forth , whom now strange meeting did befall
In a strange land , round one whom they might call

Of death , now suffering . Thus the vast array
Of those fraternal bands were reconciled that day

Made free by love ; -- a mighty brotherhood
Linked by a jealous interchange of good

When they return from carnage , and are sent
In triumph bright beneath the populous battlement

Bright pennons on the idle winds were hung
As we approached , a shout of joyance sprung

The sudden clamour of delight had cast
When from before its face some general wreck had passed

Throng from the mountains when the storms are there
And , as we passed through the calm sunny air

And fairest hands bound them on many a head
Those angels of love 's heaven that over all was spread

Of anger turned to love , from ill beguiled
And every one on them more gently smiled

And did with soft attraction ever draw
Their spirits to the love of freedom 's equal law

The parent of this joy ! ' and fair eyes gifted
With feelings , caught from one who had uplifted

Like restless clouds before the steadfast sun
Where was that Maid ? I asked , but it was known of none

Within my lips with fear ; but to subdue
Such dreadful hope , to my great task was due

To judge what need for that great throng might be
For now the stars came thick over the twilight sea

All kindly succour -- Therefore to the gate
Of the Imperial House , now desolate

Upon the footstool of his golden throne
Which , starred with sunny gems , in its own lustre shone

Flocked yesterday , who solace sought to bring
In his abandonment ! -- She knew the King

Mid her sad task of unregarded love
That to no smiles it might his speechless sadness move

The gaze of strangers -- our loud entrance woke
The echoes of the hall , which circling broke

Of footfalls answered , and the twilight 's gloom
Lay like a charnel 's mist within the radiant dome

Lay beauty , which makes hearts that feed thereon
Sick with excess of sweetness ; on the throne

With hue like that when some great painter dips
His pencil in the gloom of earthquake and eclipse

A sweet and solemn smile , like Cythna 's , cast
One moment 's light , which made my heart beat fast

Which wrapped it , even as with a father 's kiss
I pressed those softest eyes in trembling tenderness

But he , while pride and fear held deep debate
With sullen guile of ill-dissembled hate

The desolator now , and unaware
The curses which he mocked had caught him by the hair

We went , and left the shades which tend on sleep
Over its unregarded gold to keep

Glanced in the starlight ; wildered seemed she
And , when I spake , for sobs she could not answer me

Might hear . I trembled , for the truth was known
He with this child had thus been left alone

And she a nursling of captivity
Knew nought beyond those walls , nor what such change might be

Which once made all things subject to its power
Such wonder seized him , as if hour by hour

To desolateness , in the hearts of all
Like wonder stirred , who saw such awful change befall

Of hail in spring , pattering along the ground
Their many footsteps fell , else came no sound

Concealing in the dust his visage wan
Refuge from the keen looks which through his bosom ran

Or her ; -- when food was brought to them , her share
To his averted lips the child did bear

Hunger then overcame , and of his state
Forgetful , on the dust as in a trance he sate

'And he is fallen ! ' they cry , 'he who did dwell
Like famine or the plague , or aught more fell

Of blood and tears with ruin ! he is here
Sunk in a gulf of scorn from which none may him rear

Shall Othman only unavenged despoil
Shall they who by the stress of grinding toil

Or creep within his veins at will ? -- Arise
And to high justice make her chosen sacrifice

In the true love of freedom , cease to dread
This one poor lonely man -- beneath Heaven spread

For all , let him go free ; until the worth
Of human nature win from these a second birth

And tremble not . Shall they insult and kill
If such they be ? their mild eyes can they fill

Of virtue sees that justice is the light
Of love , and not revenge , and terror and despite

Shrouding his head , which now that infant fair
Clasped on her lap in silence ; -- through the air

Of him whom late they cursed , a solace sweet
His very victims brought -- soft looks and speeches meet

Some likeness of his ancient state was lent
And if his heart could have been innocent

Men said , into a smile which guile portended
A sight with which that child like hope with fear was blended

Decreed to hold a sacred Festival
A rite to attest the equality of all

Laone to my thoughts , with hopes that make
The flood recede from which their thirst they seek to slake

And the great City , with a countenance pale
I went : -- it was a sight which might avail

Was torn , to see Earth from her general womb
Pour forth her swarming sons to a fraternal doom

Of Earth to Heaven from its free children tossed
While the eternal hills , and the sea lost

With human joy made mute society
Its witnesses with men who must hereafter be

Of millions in one night created there
Sudden as when the moonrise makes appear

The light of genius ; its still shadow hid
Far ships : to know its height the morning mists forbid

Atlantic waves ; and solemnly and slow
As the wind bore that tumult to and fro

Falling in pauses , from that Altar dim
As silver-sounding tongues breathed an aerial hymn

Two only bosoms with their own life trembled
And mine was one , -- and we had both dissembled

A lost and dear possession , which not won
He walks in lonely gloom beneath the noonday sun

As I approached , the morning 's golden mist
Which now the wonder-stricken breezes kissed

In earliest light , by vintagers , and one
Sate there , a female Shape upon an ivory throne

The faiths of men : all mortal eyes were drawn
As famished mariners through strange seas gone

With thoughts which none could share , from that fair sight
I turned in sickness , for a veil shrouded her countenance bright

Which we , they said , in strength had gathered there
From the sleep of bondage ; nor the vision fair

Leaning upon my friend , till like a wind
To fevered cheeks , a voice flowed o'er my troubled mind

I was so calm and joyous. -- I could see
The platform where we stood , the statues three

As when eclipse hath passed , things sudden shine
To men 's astonished eyes most clear and crystalline

And thou art our first votary here , ' she said
' I had a dear friend once , but he is dead

This veil between us two that thou beneath
Shouldst image one who may have been long lost in death

To be the Priestess of this holiest rite
I scarcely know , but that the floods of light

Thine hand with mine , and may all comfort wither
From both the hearts whose pulse in joy now beat together

She paused , and pointed upwards -- sculptured there
Three shapes around her ivory throne appear

In dream , sceptres and crowns ; and one did keep
Its watchful eyes in doubt whether to smile or weep

Her looks were sweet as Heaven 's when loveliest
In Autumn eves . The third Image was dressed

Lay Faith , an obscene worm , who sought to rise
While calmly on the Sun he turned his diamond eyes

Cast from one cloudless star , and on the crowd
That touch which none who feels forgets , bestowed

That rite had place ; it ceased when sunset 's blaze
Burned o'er the isles . All stood in joy and deep amaze

-- When in the silence of all spirits there
Laone 's voice was felt , and through the air

'Calm art thou as yon sunset ! swift and strong
As new-fledged Eagles , beautiful and young

And underneath thy feet writhe Faith , and Folly
Custom , and Hell , and mortal Melancholy

With one wide wind as it flies
Wisdom ! thy irresistible children rise

To hail thee , and the elements they chain
And their own will , to swell the glory of thy train

' O Spirit vast and deep as Night and Heaven
Mother and soul of all to which is given

Lo ! thou dost re-ascend the human heart
Thy throne of power , almighty as thou wert

Descends amidst us ; -- Scorn and Hate
Revenge and Selfishness are desolate

A hundred nations swear that there shall be
Pity and Peace and Love , among the good and free

'Eldest of things , divine Equality
Wisdom and Love are but the slaves of thee

Treasures from all the cells of human thought
And from the Stars , and from the Ocean brought

Comest upon the paths of men
Earth bares her general bosom to thy ken

And all her children here in glory meet
To feed upon thy smiles , and clasp thy sacred feet

'My brethren , we are free ! the plains and mountains
The gray sea-shore , the forests and the fountains

Their common bondage burst , may freely borrow
From lawless love a solace for their sorrow

In blended hearts , now holds dominion
The dawn of mind , which upwards on a pinion

Borne , swift as sunrise , far illumines space
And clasps this barren world in its own bright embrace

'My brethren , we are free ! The fruits are glowing
Beneath the stars , and the night-winds are flowing

Never again may blood of bird or beast
Stain with its venomous stream a human feast

Our toil from thought all glorious forms shall cull
To make this Earth , our home , more beautiful

And Science , and her sister Poesy
Shall clothe in light the fields and cities of the free

'Victory , Victory to the prostrate nations
Bear witness Night , and ye mute Constellations

Thoughts have gone forth whose powers can sleep no more
Victory ! Victory ! Earth 's remotest shore

Kings shall turn pale ! Almighty Fear
The Fiend-God , when our charmed name he hear

Shall fade like shadow from his thousand fanes
While Truth with Joy enthroned o'er his lost empire reigns

In tones whose sweetness silence did prolong
As if to lingering winds they did belong

Which whoso heard was mute , for it could teach
To rapture like her own all listening hearts to reach

In the shadow of the shores ; as dead leaves wake
Under the wave , in flowers and herbs which make

Such living change , and kindling murmurs flew
As o'er that speechless calm delight and wonder grew

Blazed wide and far : the banquet of the free
Was spread beneath many a dark cypress-tree

And Hope , and Justice , and Laone 's name
Earth 's children did a woof of happy converse frame

As when some parent fondly reconciles
Her warring children , she their wrath beguiles

And continents , and winds , and oceans deep
All shapes might throng to share , that fly , or walk or creep

Of pomegranates and citrons , fairest fruit
Melons , and dates , and figs , and many a root

Into a mortal bane , and brown corn set
In baskets ; with pure streams their thirsting lips they wet

Were silent as she passed ; she did unwind
Her veil , as with the crowds of her own kind

Amidst a group , where on the utmost plain
A festal watchfire burned beside the dusky main

That flow among the isles , held us in chains
Of sweet captivity which none disdains

The multitudes went homeward , to their rest
Which that delightful day with its own shadow blessed

So late had been restored , beneath the gleams
Of the silver stars ; and ever in soft dreams

Of the last watchfire fell , and darkness wrapped
The waves , and each bright chain of floating fire was snapped

And first , one pale and breathless passed us by
And stared and spoke not ; -- then with piercing cry

Hither and thither hurrying with pale cheeks
Each one from fear unknown a sudden refuge seeks

Comes to enslave us in his name ! to arms
In vain : for Panic , the pale fiend who charms

Came to me , as to know their cause I lept
On the gate 's turret , and in rage and grief and scorn I wept

The yells of victory and the screams of woe
I heard approach , and saw the throng below

Of bombs flares overhead -- at intervals
The red artillery 's bolt mangling among them falls

I rushed among the rout , to have repelled
That miserable flight -- one moment quelled

Their steps , they stood ; but soon came pouring there
New multitudes , and did those rallied bands o'erbear

Whelmed me , and from the gate availed to drive
With quickening impulse , as each bolt did rive

In one dread mass , were parted , and the stain
Of blood , from mortal steel fell o'er the fields like rain

Of horsemen o'er the wide fields murdering sweep
And with loud laughter for their tyrant reap

A killing rain of fire : -- when the waves smile
As sudden earthquakes light many a volcano-isle

Whose stony eyes glared in the morning light
I trod ; -- to me there came no thought of flight

Of virtuous shame return , the crowd I stirred
And desperation 's hope in many hearts recurred

Of gathered eyebrows , did the victors fill
With doubt even in success ; deliberate will

And ever still our comrades were hewn down
And their defenceless limbs beneath our footsteps strown

The old man whom I loved -- his eyes divine
With a mild look of courage answered mine

Of war extended , to our rallying cry
As myriads flocked in love and brotherhood to die

Too near , those slaves were swiftly overthrown
By hundreds leaping on them : -- flesh and bone

More fast and fiery , and the conquerors laughed
In pride to hear the wind our screams of torment waft

Of the dead and dying , which in that green glen
Like stifled torrents , made a plashy fen

It 'gan to sink -- a fiercer combat raged
For in more doubtful strife the armies were engaged

For natural rights : a shout of joyance sent
Even from our hearts the wide air pierced and rent

A line which covered and sustained the rest
A confident phalanx , which the foes on every side invest

Bring victory ; so dismounting , close they drew
Their glittering files , and then the combat grew

Or the red sword , failed like a mountain river
Which rushes forth in foam to sink in sands for ever

Who sits and scoffs ! -- That friend so mild and good
Who like its shadow near my youth had stood

Under my feet ! -- I lost all sense or care
And like the rest I grew desperate and unaware

For love . The ground in many a little dell
Was broken , up and down whose steeps befell

Strove , and their eyes started with cracking stare
And impotent their tongues they lolled into the air

Have each their mark and sign -- some ghastly stain
And this was thine , O War ! of hate and pain

While carnage in the sunbeam 's warmth did seethe
Till twilight o'er the east wove her serenest wreath

New banners shone ; they quivered in the ray
Of the sun 's unseen orb -- ere night the array

Vanquished and faint , the grasp of bloody hands
I felt , and saw on high the glare of falling brands

Comes trampling over the dead , the living bleed
Beneath the hoofs of that tremendous steed

And fly , as through their ranks with awful might
Sweeps in the shadow of eve that Phantom swift and bright

Through night , bore accents to mine ear whose force
Might create smiles in death -- the Tartar horse

Of waters in the desert , as she said
'Mount with me , Laon , now ' -- I rapidly obeyed

But like the vapour of the tempest fled
Over the plain ; her dark hair was dispread

Fitfully , and the hills and streams fled fast
As o'er their glimmering forms the steed 's broad shadow passed

Surrounded us ; -- and still away ! away
Through the desert night we sped , while she alway

Of the obscure stars gleamed ; -- its rugged breast
The steed strained up , and then his impulse did arrest

Of waters , as in spots for ever haunted
By the choicest winds of Heaven , which are enchanted

Upon the plain , be seen by those who stood
Thence marking the dark shore of Ocean 's curved flood

As from the lofty steed she did alight
Cythna , ( for , from the eyes whose deepest light

My own sweet Cythna looked ) , with joy did quail
And felt her strength in tears of human weakness fail

At length she looked on me , and half unclosing
Her tremulous lips , said , 'Friend , thy bands were losing

The time , did seize a Tartar 's sword , and spring
Upon his horse , and swift , as on the whirlwind 's wing

And rose-like lips , and many a fragrant weed
From the green ruin plucked , that he might feed

Of rest , ' and I heaped up the courser 's bed
In a green mossy nook , with mountain flowers dispread

Memories , like awful ghosts which come and go
And must inherit all he builds below

Clasping its gray rents with a verdurous woof
A hanging dome of leaves , a canopy moon-proof

Of flowering parasites , did Spring love to dress
With their sweet blooms the wintry loneliness

Whose intertwining fingers ever there
Made music wild and soft that filled the listening air

Of life , our bark doth on its whirlpools bear
Spreading swift wings as sails to the dim air

Louder and louder from the utmost Ocean
Of universal life , attuning its commotion

Though linked years had bound it there ; for now
A power , a thirst , a knowledge , which below

Came on us , as we sate in silence there
Beneath the golden stars of the clear azure air

Of inexpressive speech : -- the youthful years
Which we together passed , their hopes and fears

The thoughts expressed by them , our very names
And all the winged hours which speechless memory claims

A wandering Meteor by some wild wind sent
Hung high in the green dome , to which it lent

Strewed strangest sounds the moving leaves among
A wondrous light , the sound as of a spirit 's tongue

My neck near hers ; her dark and deepening eyes
Which , as twin phantoms of one star that lies

Her marble brow , and eager lips , like roses
With their own fragrance pale , which Spring but half uncloses

Within her frame , mingle with mine , and fall
Around my heart like fire ; and over all

Two disunited spirits when they leap
In union from this earth 's obscure and fading sleep

Even from our own cold looks , when we had gone
Into a wide and wild oblivion

The seasons , and mankind their changes know
Left fear and time unfelt by us alone below

Of the life meeting , when the faint eyes swim
Through tears of a wide mist boundless and dim

Where far over the world those vapours roll
Which blend two restless frames in one reposing soul

O'er her pale bosom : -- all within was still
And the sweet peace of joy did almost fill

The waves contending in its caverns strook
For they foreknew the storm , and the gray ruin shook

Few were the living hearts which could unite
Like ours , or celebrate a bridal night

Of earliest love , delayed and cherished long
Which common hopes and fears made , like a tempest , strong

Or common slavery mar what else might move
All gentlest thoughts ; as in the sacred grove

Strike with her shadow , shrinks in fear awhile
But its own kindred leaves clasps while the sunbeams smile

Were linked , for love had nursed us in the haunts
Where knowledge , from its secret source enchants

As the great Nile feeds Egypt ; ever flinging
Light on the woven boughs which o'er its waves are swinging

And so we sate , until our talk befell
Of the late ruin , swift and horrible

For us , this ruin made a watch-tower lone
But Cythna 's eyes looked faint , and now two days were gone

Bent his thin head to seek the brazen rein
Following me obediently ; with pain

Till they have told their fill , could scarce express
The anguish of her mute and fearful tenderness

Down the ravine of rocks , did soon unite
The darkness and the tumult of their might

Of Cythna gleamed , and her voice once again
Came to me on the gust , and soon I reached the plain

And when the earth beneath his tameless tread
Shook with the sullen thunder , he would spread

O'er the lit plain , and soon I could descry
Where Death and Fire had gorged the spoil of victory

A heap of hearthless walls ; -- the flames were dead
Within those dwellings now , -- the life had fled

By the black rafters , and around did lie
Women , and babes , and men , slaughtered confusedly

And on the earth and on the vacant air
And upon me , close to the waters where

But tied the steed beside , and sought in haste
If any yet survived amid that ghastly waste

Into a fiend , by some strange misery
Soon as she heard my steps she leaped on me

And cried , 'Now , Mortal , thou hast deeply quaffed
The Plague 's blue kisses -- soon millions shall pledge the draught

Of three death-wounds -- the flames had ate the other
Since then I have no longer been a mother

All lips which I have kissed must surely wither
But Death 's -- if thou art he , we 'll go to work together

In my sweet boy , now full of worms -- but tell
First what thou seek'st . ' -- ' I seek for food . ' -- '' Tis well

Is Famine , but he drives not from his door
Those whom these lips have kissed , alone . No more , no more

We came to a lone hut where on the earth
Which made its floor , she in her ghastly mirth

Among the dead -- round which she set in state
A ring of cold , stiff babes ; silent and stark they sate

And then she spurned the loaves with her pale feet
Towards her bloodless guests ; -- that sight to meet

Despair , I might have raved in sympathy
But now I took the food that woman offered me

The lightning now grew pallid -- rapidly
As by the shore of the tempestuous sea

Cythna among the rocks , where she alway
Had sate with anxious eyes fixed on the lingering day

As to our home we went , and thus embraced
Her full heart seemed a deeper joy to taste

We reached our home ere morning could unbind
Night 's latest veil , and on our bridal-couch reclined

Which spreads its shrunk leaves in the sunny air
After cold showers , like rainbows woven there

Of health , and hope ; and sorrow languished near it
And fear , and all that dark despondence doth inherit

Among the dewy weeds , the sun was warm
And we sate linked in the inwoven charm

Time , though he wield the darts of death and sleep
And those thrice mortal barbs in his own poison steep

Came to my spirit in my solitude
And all that now I was -- while tears pursued

From sunbright dales ; and when I ceased to speak
Her accents soft and sweet the pausing air did wake

So wild were they , could her own faith impart
She said that not a tear did dare to start

Borne by those slaves across the Ocean 's term
And that she reached the port without one fear infirm

But she was calm and sad , musing alway
On loftiest enterprise , till on a day

Like winds that die in wastes -- one moment mute
The evil thoughts it made , which did his breast pollute

But when he bade her to his secret bower
Be borne , a loveless victim , and she tore

Again his load of slavery , and became
A king , a heartless beast , a pageant and a name

To dally with the mowing dead -- that night
All torture , fear , or horror made seem light

Where like a Spirit in fleshly chains she lay
Struggling , aghast and pale the Tyrant fled away

Which might not be withstood -- whence none could save
All who approached their sphere , -- like some calm wave

Fearless and free , and they began to breathe
Deep curses , like the voice of flames far underneath

From human shape into an instrument
Of all things ill -- distorted , bowed and bent

But to obey : from the fire isles came he
A diver lean and strong , of Oman 's coral sea

They anchored then , where , be there calm or breeze
The gloomiest of the drear Symplegades

Like iron clasped her feet , and plunged with her
Among the closing waves out of the boundless air

Through many a cavern which the eternal flood
Had scooped , as dark lairs for its monster brood

His heels , he wound : until the dark rocks under
He touched a golden chain -- a sound arose like thunder

And in that roof of crags a space was riven
Through which there shone the emerald beams of heaven

Through which , his way the diver having cloven
Passed like a spark sent up out of a burning oven

Imprisoned , boiled and leaped perpetually
Down which , one moment resting , he did flee

Whose aery dome is inaccessible
Was pierced with one round cleft through which the sunbeams fell

With mystic legends by no mortal hand
Left there , when thronging to the moon 's command

Columns , and shapes like statues , and the state
Of kingless thrones , which Earth did in her heart create

And a sea-eagle brought me food the while
Whose nest was built in that untrodden isle

Like light and rest at morn and even is sought
That wild bird was to me , till madness misery brought

In the blue heaven so beautiful and fair
Like hosts of ghastly shadows hovering there

Transformed into the agony which I wore
Even as a poisoned robe around my bosom 's core

Within me -- a strange load my heart did bear
As if some living thing had made its lair

Then grew , like sweet reality among
Dim visionary woes , an unreposing throng

I and my child ; and still new pulses seemed
To beat beside my heart , and still I deemed

Methought , after a lapse of lingering pain
I saw that lovely shape , which near my heart had lain

It laid its fingers , as now rest on mine
Thine own , beloved ! -- 't was a dream divine

Though 't was a dream . ' -- Then Cythna did uplift
Her looks on mine , as if some doubt she sought to shift

She spoke : 'Yes , in the wilderness of years
Her memory , aye , like a green home appears

Methought I felt her lips and breath approve
It was a human thing which to my bosom clove

Or sun , from many a prism within the cave
Their gem-born shadows to the water gave

She would mark one , and laugh , when that command
Slighting , it lingered there , and could not understand

That it was meaningless ; her touch would meet
Mine , and our pulses calmly flow and beat

With heaps of golden shells we two did play
Both infants , weaving wings for time 's perpetual way

On one fair mother 's bosom : -- from that night
She fled , -- like those illusions clear and bright

Though 't was the death of brainless fantasy
Yet smote my lonesome heart more than all misery

When he so swiftly sunk , as once before
Then morning came -- it shone even as of yore

Day after day , and sitting there alone
Vexed the inconstant waves with my perpetual moan

Was passing -- with a gush of sickening pain
It ebbed even to its withered springs again

Have waked the dream for which my spirit yearned
With more than human love , -- then left it unreturned

Had made its lair , and on my heart did feast
But all that cave and all its shapes , possessed

Me heretofore : I , sitting there alone
Vexed the inconstant waves with my perpetual moan

And I became at last even as a shade
A smoke , a cloud on which the winds have preyed

Spreading his azure sail where breath of Heaven
Descended not , among the waves and whirlpools driven

The Eagle , hovering o'er his prey did float
But when he saw that I with fear did note

He came where that bright child of sea did swim
And o'er it cast in peace his shadow broad and dim

My spirit felt again like one of those
Like thine , whose fate it is to make the woes

Immutable , resistless , strong to save
Like mind while yet it mocks the all-devouring grave

Which I had sworn to rend ? I might be free
Could I but win that friendly bird to me

Of objects , if such aid he could be taught
But fruit , and flowers , and boughs , yet never ropes he brought

Or cast a lustre on them -- time imparted
Such power to me -- I became fearless-hearted

Its lustre on all hidden things , behind
Yon dim and fading clouds which load the weary wind

To me the keeping of its secrets gave
One mind , the type of all , the moveless wave

And sympathy , fountains of hope and fear
Justice , and truth , and time , and the world 's natural sphere

A subtler language within language wrought
The key of truths which once were dimly taught

From mine own voice in dream , when thy dear eyes
Shone through my sleep , and did that utterance harmonize

My heart with joy , and there we sate again
On the gray margin of the glimmering main

Fear , Faith and Slavery ; and mankind was free
Equal , and pure , and wise , in Wisdom 's prophecy

They would make human throngs gather and rise
To combat with my overflowing eyes

And war of earthly minds , from which I drew
The power which has been mine to frame their thoughts anew

Religion 's pomp made desolate by the scorn
Of Wisdom 's faintest smile , and thrones uptorn

And love made free , -- a hope which we have nursed
Even with our blood and tears , -- until its glory burst

Girt by its hell of power , the secret sound
Of hymns to truth and freedom -- the dread bound

Racks which degraded woman 's greatness tell
And what may else be good and irresistible

As in its sleep some odorous violet
While yet its leaves with nightly dews are wet

Spring 's messengers descending from the skies
The buds foreknow their life -- this hope must ever rise

Had fallen in universal ruin wracked
And through the cleft streamed in one cataract

Was ebbing round me , and my bright abode
Before me yawned -- a chasm desert , and bare , and broad

With splash and shock into the deep -- anon
All ceased , and there was silence wide and lone

Around , and in my hair the winds did play
Lingering as they pursued their unimpeded way

The strength of tempest : day was almost over
When through the fading light I could discover

The twilight deep ; the mariners in dread
Cast anchor when they saw new rocks around them spread

Of overhanging rock , through which there flowed
The foam of streams that can not make abode

And moved as men in whom new love had stirred
Deep thoughts : so to the ship we passed without a word

Over the mountains yet ; -- the City of Gold
Yon Cape alone does from the sight withhold

Ye can not rest upon the dreary sea
Haste , haste to the warm home of happier destiny

By wicked ghosts ; a Phantom of the Dead
The night before we sailed , came to my bed

Her low voice makes you weep -- she is some bride
Or daughter of high birth -- she can be nought beside

Of the pale moon I stood , as one whom fear
May not attaint , and my calm voice did rear

Even while I speak -- beneath this very night
Their thoughts flow on like ours , in sadness or delight

How they will greet him when his toils are o'er
And laughing babes rush from the well-known door

Such purposes ? or in a human mood
Dream ye some Power thus builds for man in solitude

'Twere as if man 's own works should feel , and show
The hopes , and fears , and thoughts from which they flow

Disease , and Want , and worse Necessity
Of hate and ill , and Pride , and Fear , and Tyranny

The Form he saw and worshipped was his own
His likeness in the world 's vast mirror shown

And that men say , that Power has chosen Death
On all who scorn its laws , to wreak immortal wrath

Wields an invisible rod -- that Priests and Kings
Custom , domestic sway , ay , all that brings

Of death will make the wise his vengeance feel
Though truth and virtue arm their hearts with tenfold steel

Will bind the wretch on whom is fixed a stain
Which , like a plague , a burden , and a bane

The will of strength is right -- this human state
Tyrants , that they may rule , with lies thus desolate

To hide the orb of truth -- and every throne
Of Earth or Heaven , though shadow , rests thereon

Is slave or tyrant ; all betray and bow
Command , or kill , or fear , or wreak , or suffer woe

The pattern whence all fraud and wrong is made
A law to which mankind has been betrayed

In bloody grave , and into darkness thrown
Gathered her wildered babes around him as his own

From slavery and religion 's labyrinth caves
Guide us , as one clear star the seaman saves

She pass , to suffer all in patient mood
To weep for crime , though stained with thy friend 's dearest blood

Until life 's sunny day is quite gone down
To sit and smile with Joy , or , not alone

This is not faith or law , nor those who bow
To thrones on Heaven or Earth , such destiny may know

So man is made the captive of his brother
And Hate is throned on high with Fear her mother

Are darkened -- Woman as the bond-slave dwells
Of man , a slave ; and life is poisoned in its wells

He toils for others , who must ever be
The joyless thralls of like captivity

May be his very blood ; he is pursuing
O , blind and willing wretch ! -- his own obscure undoing

Falsehood , and fear , and toil , like waves have worn
Channels upon her cheek , which smiles adorn

Can choose but drain the bitter dregs of woe
Which ever from the oppressed to the oppressors flow

The world , like light ; and evil faith , grown hoary
With crime , be quenched and die. -- Yon promontory

High temples fade like vapour -- Man alone
Remains , whose will has power when all beside is gone

Whence come ye , friends ? Alas , I can not name
All that I read of sorrow , toil , and shame

Of conquerors and impostors false and bold
The discord of your hearts , I in your looks behold

Or from the famished poor , pale , weak and cold
Bear ye the earnings of their toil ? Unfold

Know yourselves thus ! ye shall be pure as dew
And I will be a friend and sister unto you

Stains of inevitable crime : the doom
Is this , which has , or may , or must become

Thou and thy thoughts and they , and all the toil
Wherewith ye twine the rings of life 's perpetual coil

Ah ! it is dark with many a blazoned name
Of misery -- all are mirrors of the same

Enduring there , would o'er the heads of men
Pass harmless , if they scorned to make their hearts his den

Which , when the heart its snaky folds entwine
Is wasted quite , and when it doth repine

When Amphisbaena some fair bird has tied
Soon o'er the putrid mass he threats on every side

Which , when our thoughts and actions once are gone
Demands that man should weep , and bleed , and groan

And love and joy can make the foulest breast
A paradise of flowers , where peace might build her nest

Told in these faded eyes , but much doth sleep
Within , which there the poor heart loves to keep

The bread of slavery in the tears of woe
And never dreamed of hope or refuge until now

But that no human bosom can withstand
Thee , wondrous Lady , and the mild command

Are reft , and bear o'er the dividing waves
The unregarded prey of calm and happy graves

Are stained and trampled : -- years have come and gone
Since , like the ship which bears me , I have known

She is my life , -- I am but as the shade
Of her , -- a smoke sent up from ashes , soon to fade

And still before the ocean and the gale
The ship fled fast till the stars 'gan to fail

With toil , the Captain with gray locks , whose glance
Met mine in restless awe -- they stood as in a trance

The eternal stars gaze on us ! -- is the truth
Within your soul ? care for your own , or ruth

May violate ? -- Be free ! and even here
Swear to be firm till death ! '' They cried , `` We swear ! We swear

Into the night , as if the sea and sky
And earth , rejoiced with new-born liberty

The captives gazing stood , and every one
Shrank as the inconstant torch upon her countenance shone

Dark time had there its evil legend wrought
In characters of cloud which wither not.

In the bright wisdom of youth 's breathless noon
Sweet talk , and smiles , and sighs , all bosoms did attune

Waved by the wind amid the sunny noon
Showed that her soul was quivering ; and full soon

I smiled , and both their hands in mine I took
And felt a soft delight from what their spirits shook

It shades the couch of some unresting lover
Whose heart is now at rest : thus night passed over

The waning stars pranked in the waters blue
And trembled in the wind which from the morning flew

Soon wreaths of budding foliage seemed to flow
Over the mast and sails , the stern and prow

Rejoicing , like the dwellers of an isle
Doomed to pursue those waves that can not cease to smile

Thousands did gaze , they heard the startling cry
Like Earth 's own voice lifted unconquerably

They heard ! -- As o'er the mountains of the earth
From peak to peak leap on the beams of Morning 's birth

Remotest skies , -- such glorious madness found
A path through human hearts with stream which drowned

A wide contagion poured -- they called aloud
On Liberty -- that name lived on the sunny flood

From the false dawn , which fades ere it is spread
Upon the night 's devouring darkness shed

Which wrap the world ; a wide enthusiasm
To cleanse the fevered world as with an earthquake 's spasm

And like a subterranean wind that stirs
Some forest among caves , the hopes and fears

Of joy and awe , and winged thoughts did range
And half-extinguished words , which prophesied of change

Points to the unrisen sun ! -- the shades approve
His truth , and flee from every stream and grove

For many a heart , and tameless scorn of ill
Thrice steeped in molten steel the unconquerable will

Some said , I was a fiend from my weird cave
Who had stolen human shape , and o'er the wave

Woman from bonds and death , and on my head
The burden of their sins would frightfully be laid

And they were few , but resolute ; -- the rest
Ere yet success the enterprise had blessed

By hopes which I had armed to overnumber
Those hosts of meaner cares , which life 's strong wings encumber

They looked around , and lo ! they became free
Their many tyrants sitting desolately

Whose lightning once was death , -- nor fear , nor gain
Could tempt one captive now to lock another 's chain

In the white furnace ; and a visioned swound
A pause of hope and awe the City bound

The sun , the wind , the ocean , and the earth
Hung terrible , ere yet the lightnings have leaped forth

Around the City millions gathered were
By hopes which sprang from many a hidden lair

Like homeless odours floated , and the name
Of thee , and many a tongue which thou hadst dipped in flame

And whatsoe'er , when force is impotent
To fraud the sceptre of the world has lent

To curse the rebels. -- To their gods did they
For Earthquake , Plague , and Want , kneel in the public way

Because her sons were free , -- and that among
Mankind , the many to the few belong

Marred with wild hopes the peace of slavery
With which old times and men had quelled the vain and free

And that the will of one was peace , and we
Should seek for nought on earth but toil and misery

Clung to their hoary hair , withering the pride
Which in their hollow hearts dared still abide

Said that the rule of men was over now
And hence , the subject world to woman 's will must bow

As they were wont , nor at the priestly call
Left Plague her banquet in the Ethiop 's hall

Who throng to kneel for food : nor fear nor shame
Nor faith , nor discord , dimmed hope 's newly kindled flame

Gives shape , voice , name , to spectral Terror , knew
Its downfall , as the altars lonelier grew

And the cold sneers of calumny were vain
The union of the free with discord 's brand to stain

Sitting with thee upon this lonely steep
I smile , though human love should make me weep

Over my heart , which can no longer borrow
Its hues from chance or change , dark children of to-morrow

To hide thy heart , and clothe the shapes which rove
Within the homeless Future 's wintry grove

And violence and wrong are as a dream
Which rolls from steadfast truth , an unreturning stream

Out of his Scythian cave , a savage train
Behold ! Spring sweeps over the world again

And music on the waves and woods she flings
And love on all that lives , and calm on lifeless things

The tears that fade in sunny smiles thou sharest
Sister of joy , thou art the child who wearest

Fresh flowers , and beams like flowers , with gentle feet
Disturbing not the leaves which are her winding-sheet

Truth 's deathless germs to thought 's remotest caves
Lo , Winter comes ! -- the grief of many graves

Stagnate like ice at Faith the enchanter 's word
And bind all human hearts in its repose abhorred

Because they can not speak ; and , day by day
The moon of wasting Science wanes away

And gray Priests triumph , and like blight or blast
A shade of selfish care o'er human looks is cast

Behold ! Spring comes , though we must pass , who made
The promise of its birth , -- even as the shade

As with the plumes of overshadowing wings
From its dark gulf of chains , Earth like an eagle springs

Alas ! gaze not on me , but turn thine eyes
On thine own heart -- it is a paradise

Sweet streams of sunny thought , and flowers fresh-blown
Are there , and weave their sounds and odours into one

Between the effect and it , One comes behind
Who aye the future to the past will bind

In bands of union , which no power may sever
They must bring forth their kind , and be divided never

Who leave the vesture of their majesty
To adorn and clothe this naked world ; -- and we

Whose forms their mighty spirits could conceive
To be a rule and law to ages that survive

The blood is still , be ours ; let sense and thought
Pass from our being , or be numbered not

A calm inheritance , a glorious doom
Insult with careless tread , our undivided tomb

When we shall be no more ; -- the world has seen
A type of peace ; and -- as some most serene

Of youthful hope , returning suddenly
Quells his long madness -- thus man shall remember thee

Shall sneers and curses be ; -- what we have done
None shall dare vouch , though it be truly known

And fame , in human hope which sculptured was
Survive the perished scrolls of unenduring brass

That gazed beyond the wormy grave despair
These eyes , these lips , this blood , seems darkly there

Seems our obscure and rotting eyes to steep
In joy ; -- but senseless death -- a ruin dark and deep

And fear , and pain -- we know not whence we live
Or why , or how , or what mute Power may give

A chain I can not break -- I am possessed
With thoughts too swift and strong for one lone human breast

Even as to sleep whence we again arise
Close their faint orbs in death : I fear nor prize

Darkness and death , if death be true , must be
Dearer than life and hope , if unenjoyed with thee

Winter , and Spring , and Morn , and Noon , and Even
All that we are or know , is darkly driven

Though it change all but thee ! ' -- She ceased -- night 's gloom
Meanwhile had fallen on earth from the sky 's sunless dome

The air they breathed with love , her locks undight
'Fair star of life and love , ' I cried , 'my soul 's delight

Which gazes on thee with its thousand eyes
She turned to me and smiled -- that smile was Paradise

All living things a common nature own
And thought erect an universal throne

To see her sons contend ? and makes she bare
Her breast , that all in peace its drainless stores may share

Out of her ivy bower , when I sate pale
With grief , and sighed beneath ; from many a dale

Like man 's own speech ; and such was now the token
Of waning night , whose calm by that proud neigh was broken

Over the fields , had stained the courser 's feet
Soon the dust drinks that bitter dew , -- then meet

The dead in horrid truce : their throngs did make
Behind the steed , a chasm like waves in a ship 's wake

Of fire , whose floods the wild deer circumvent
In the scorched pastures of the South ; so bent

Trembled , as with a zone of ruin bound
Beneath their feet , the sea shook with their Navies ' sound

Like sheep whom from the fold the shepherd brings
To the stall , red with blood ; their many kings

Of Indian breezes lull , and many a band
The Arctic Anarch sent , and Idumea 's sand

His Asian shield and bow , when , at the will
Of Europe 's subtler son , the bolt would kill

And savage sympathy : those slaves impure
Each one the other thus from ill to ill did lure

With secret signs from many a mountain-tower
With smoke by day , and fire by night , the power

Like wolves and serpents to their mutual wars
Strange truce , with many a rite which Earth and Heaven abhors

Choked with his country 's dead : -- his footsteps reel
On the fresh blood -- he smiles . 'Ay , now I feel

Be brought , and fire , and pincers , and the hook
And scorpions , that his soul on its revenge might look

The scales of victory yet ; -- let none survive
But those within the walls -- each fifth shall give

My speech , ' a soldier answered -- 'but we fear
The spirits of the night , and morn is drawing near

An Angel bright as day , waving a brand
Which flashed among the stars , passed . ' -- 'Dost thou stand

Whoso will drag that woman to his side
That scared him thus , may burn his dearest foe beside

The wheeled artillery 's speed the pavement tore
The infantry , file after file , did pour

Stream through the city ; on the seventh , the dew
Of slaughter became stiff , and there was peace anew

Of victims to their fiery judgement led
Made pale their voiceless lips who seemed to dread

Peace in the Tyrant 's palace , where the throng
Waste the triumphal hours in festival and song

A lamp of Autumn , ripening with its flame
The few lone ears of corn ; -- the sky became

All moisture , and a rotting vapour passed
From the unburied dead , invisible and fast

Had lured , or who , from regions far away
Had tracked the hosts in festival array

In their green eyes a strange disease did glow
They sank in hideous spasm , or pains severe and slow

Who had survived the wild beasts ' hungry chase
Died moaning , each upon the other 's face

Like starving infants wailed ; a woeful ditty
And many a mother wept , pierced with unnatural pity

Startling the concourse of mankind. -- Too well
These signs the coming mischief did foretell

A voiceless thought of evil , which did spread
With the quick glance of eyes , like withering lightnings shed

Came Famine , a swift shadow , and the air
Groaned with the burden of a new despair

With lidless eyes , lie Faith , and Plague , and Slaughter
A ghastly brood ; conceived of Lethe 's sullen water

The deeps were foodless , and the winds no more
Creaked with the weight of birds , but , as before

Were burned ; -- so that the meanest food was weighed
With gold , and Avarice died before the god it made

Was fixed in eager horror then : his gold
The miser brought ; the tender maid , grown bold

By instinct blind as love , but turned again
And bade her infant suck , and died in silent pain

With brothers ' blood ! O , that the earthquake 's grave
Would gape , or Ocean lift its stifling wave

Or sit in frenzy 's unimagined mood
Upon fresh heaps of dead ; a ghastly multitude

At sunrise . Thither still the myriads came
Seeking to quench the agony of the flame

Spotted with nameless scars and lurid blains
Childhood , and youth , and age , writhing in savage pains

Of that dread sight to self-destruction sent
Those shrieking victims ; some , ere life was spent

Their matted hair , and cried aloud , 'We tread
On fire ! the avenging Power his hell on earth has spread

Under the sun , was heard one stifled prayer
For life , in the hot silence of the air

As if not dead , but slumbering quietly
Like forms which sculptors carve , then love to agony

One shadow upon all . Famine can smile
On him who brings it food , and pass , with guile

Comes Plague , a winged wolf , who loathes alway
The garbage and the scum that strangers make her prey

That lingered on his lips , the warrior 's might
Was loosened , and a new and ghastlier night

Among the guests , or raving mad did tell
Strange truths ; a dying seer of dark oppression 's hell

On their own hearts : they sought and they could find
No refuge -- 't was the blind who led the blind

In sad procession : each among the train
To his own Idol lifts his supplications vain

Thy fearful might ; we bend in fear and shame
Before thy presence ; with the dust we claim

Made dim , but be at length our sins forgiven
Ere to despair and death thy worshippers be driven

The shafts of thy revenge , a blistering rain
Greatest and best , be merciful again

Where thou wert worshipped with their blood , and laid
Those hearts in dust which would thy searchless works have weighed

And bind their souls by an immortal vow
We swear by thee ! and to our oath do thou

The last of those who mocked thy holy name
And scorned the sacred laws thy prophets did proclaim

The light of other minds ; -- troubled they passed
From the great Temple ; -- fiercely still and fast

And through the hosts contention wild befell
As each of his own god the wondrous works did tell

Before , as watchwords of a single woe
Arose ; each raging votary 'gan to throw

Would have gone forth , when from beneath a cowl
A voice came forth , which pierced like ice through every soul

To quell the unbelievers ; a dire guest
Even to his friends was he , for in his breast

He loathed all faith beside his own , and pined
To wreak his fear of Heaven in vengeance on mankind

Even where his Idol stood ; for , far and near
Did many a heart in Europe leap to hear

The murderer 's cell , or see , with helpless groan
The priests his children drag for slaves to serve their own

So he made truce with those who did despise
The expiation , and the sacrifice

For fear of God did in his bosom breed
A jealous hate of man , an unreposing need

The errors of his faith in endless woe
But there is sent a mortal vengeance now

By whom for ye this dread reward was earned
And kingly thrones , which rest on faith , nigh overturned

His mercy soothed it to a dark repose
It walks upon the earth to judge his foes

The gates of death , ere they receive the twain
Who shook with mortal spells his undefended reign

By the swift shafts of pestilence ere dawn
Are in their jaws ! they hunger for the spawn

Like dogs , and they will sleep with luxury spent
When those detested hearts their iron fangs have rent

Pour venomous gums , which sullenly and slow
When touched by flame , shall burn , and melt , and flow

A couch of snakes , and scorpions , and the fry
Of centipedes and worms , earth 's hellish progeny

Of Heaven may be appeased . ' He ceased , and they
A space stood silent , as far , far away

Muttering the curses of his speechless pride
Whilst shame , and fear , and awe , the armies did divide

And Heaven above seemed cloven , where , on a throne
Girt round with storms and shadows , sate alone

Before , and with an inward fire possessed
They raged like homeless beasts whom burning woods invest

Is set on Laon and Laone 's head
He who but one yet living here can lead

But he who both alive can hither bring
The Princess shall espouse , and reign an equal King

That spacious square ; for Fear is never slow
To build the thrones of Hate , her mate and foe

Plague-stricken , foodless , like lean herds pursued
By gadflies , they have piled the heath , and gums , and wood

Two gentle sisters mourn their desolation
And in the silence of that expectation

Of the swift pest , with fearful interval
Marking its path with shrieks , among the crowd would fall

The frosts of many a wind with dead leaves fill
Earth 's cold and sullen brooks ; in silence , still

Like hunger or disease , with whispers drear
As 'Hush ! hark ! Come they yet ? -- Just Heaven ! thine hour is near

To see his enemies writhe , and burn , and bleed
And that , till then , the snakes of Hell had need

Men brought their infidel kindred to appease
God 's wrath , and , while they burned , knelt round on quivering knees

Again at sunset. -- Who shall dare to say
The deeds which night and fear brought forth , or weigh

And cast a light on those dim labyrinths , where
Hope , near imagined chasms , is struggling with despair

Feasting like fiends upon the infidel dead
Looked from their meal , and saw an Angel tread

Came to the fire , and said , 'Stop , I am he
Kill me ! ' -- They burned them both with hellish mockery

Which shrank as overgorged , they laid them down
And sung a low sweet song , of which alone

Like love , and died ; and then that they did die
With happy smiles , which sunk in white tranquillity

Over her look , the shadow of a mood
Which only clothes the heart in solitude

Was murmuring in its caves ; -- the wind had blown
Her hair apart , through which her eyes and forehead shone

Of darkness in the North : -- the day was dying
Sudden , the sun shone forth , its beams were lying

The power of light in vain , tossed restlessly
In the red Heaven , like wrecks in a tempestuous sea

Its waves gushed forth like fire , and as if swayed
By some mute tempest , rolled on HER ; the shade

Her radiant shape upon its verge did shiver
Aloft , her flowing hair like strings of flame did quiver

A passion deeper far than tears , or mirth
Or speech , or gesture , or whate'er has birth

From her far eyes a light of deep revealing
All but her dearest self from my regard concealing

Absorbed the glories of the burning skies
Which , mingling with her heart 's deep ecstasies

From her whole frame , an atmosphere which quite
Arrayed her in its beams , tremulous and soft and bright

Which now the cold winds stole ; -- she would have laid
Upon my languid heart her dearest head

My soul with their own joy. -- One moment yet
I gazed -- we parted then , never again to meet

Around my will to link it with her own
So that my stern resolve was almost gone

Return , ah me ! return ! ' -- The wind passed by
On which those accents died , faint , far , and lingeringly

Eminent among those victims -- even the Fear
Of Hell : each girt by the hot atmosphere

Of circling coals of fire ; but still there clung
One hope , like a keen sword on starting threads uphung

All natural dreams : to wake was not to weep
But to gaze mad and pallid , at the leap

Its withering beam upon his slaves , did urge
Their steps ; they heard the roar of Hell 's sulphureous surge

Stares at the rising tide , or like the crew
Whilst now the ship is splitting through and through

One murmur on the wind , or if some word
Which none can gather yet , the distant crowd has stirred

Sleepless a second night ? they are not here
The victims , and hour by hour , a vision drear

The crowd is mute and moveless -- overhead
Silent Arcturus shines -- 'Ha ! hear'st thou not the tread

Falsely -- 't is but a crowd of maniacs stark
Driven , like a troop of spectres , through the dark

From its blue train , and spreading widely , clung
To their wild hair , like mist the topmost pines among

When the last echo of those terrible cries
Came from a distant street , like agonies

In stony expectation fixed ; when one
Sudden before them stood , a Stranger and alone

Ere yet the matter did their thoughts arrest
Earnest , benignant , calm , as from a breast

His speech to them , on each unwilling heart
Unusual awe did fall -- a spirit-quelling dart

And sprang from sleep ! -- dark Terror has obeyed
Your bidding -- O , that I whom ye have made

Which can not pass so soon , and Hate must be
The nurse and parent still of an ill progeny

Than ye conceive of power , should fear the lies
Which thou , and thou , didst frame for mysteries

Ye now prepare , for a vain idol wrought
Out of the fears and hate which vain desires have brought

For which , O willing slaves to Custom old
Severe taskmistress ! ye your hearts have sold

And senseless then ; if aught survive , I deem
It must be love and joy , for they immortal seem

Into the dust those symbols of your woe
Purple , and gold , and steel ! that ye would go

And that mankind is free , and that the shame
Of royalty and faith is lost in freedom 's fame

Arose , for many of those warriors young
Had on his eloquent accents fed and hung

The men of faith and law then without ruth
Drew forth their secret steel , and stabbed each ardent youth

And one more daring raised his steel anew
To pierce the Stranger . 'What hast thou to do

His dagger on the ground , and pale with fear
Sate silently -- his voice then did the Stranger rear

A book of blood , whence in a milder day
Men shall learn truth , when ye are wrapped in clay

So ye concede one easy boon . Attend
For now I speak of things which ye can apprehend

Are worshipped ; from a glorious Mother 's breast
Who , since high Athens fell , among the rest

Turns to her chainless child for succour now
It draws the milk of Power in Wisdom 's fullest flow

Of sunrise gleams when Earth is wrapped in gloom
An epitaph of glory for the tomb

Thy growth is swift as morn , when night must fade
The multitudinous Earth shall sleep beneath thy shade

Of a new Heaven ; myriads assemble there
Whom the proud lords of man , in rage or fear

Nay , start not at the name -- America
And then to you this night Laon will I betray

Shone in a hundred human eyes -- 'Where , where
Is Laon ? Haste ! fly ! drag him swiftly here

The Stranger threw his vest back suddenly
And smiled in gentle pride , and said , 'Lo ! I am he

The starveling waked , and died in joy ; the dying
Among the corpses in stark agony lying

With loud acclaim , the living shook Heaven 's cope
And filled the startled Earth with echoes : morn did ope

The blackness of the faith it seems to hide
And see , the Tyrant 's gem-wrought chariot glide

A child most beautiful . I ' the midst appears
Laon , -- exempt alone from mortal hopes and fears

There are no sneers upon his lip which speak
That scorn or hate has made him bold ; his cheek

Smile on mankind -- his heart seems reconciled
To all things and itself , like a reposing child

Into their brain , and became calm with awe.
See , the slow pageant near the pile doth draw

Await the signal round : the morning fair
Is changed to a dim night by that unnatural glare

Girt by the chieftains of the host ; all smile
In expectation , but one child : the while

Is dark in the bright dawn ; towers far and near
Pierce like reposing flames the tremulous atmosphere

Expect the second ; all were mute but one
That fairest child , who , bold with love , alone

Was heard -- she trembled like one aspen pale
Among the gloomy pines of a Norwegian vale

Roared -- hark , again ! In that dread pause he lay
As in a quiet dream -- the slaves obey

Millions , with hearts that beat both loud and fast
Watch for the springing flame expectant and aghast

The tramp of hoofs like earthquake , and a steed
Dark and gigantic , with the tempest 's speed

Calm , radiant , like the phantom of the dawn
A spirit from the caves of daylight wandering gone

Her innocence his child from fear did save
Scared by the faith they feigned , each priestly slave

Sucked into the loud sea , the multitude
With crushing panic , fled in terror 's altered mood

One checked , who , never in his mildest dreams
Felt awe from grace or loveliness , the seams

That he is wise , whose wounds do only bleed
Inly for self , -- thus thought the Iberian Priest indeed

Now with a bitter smile , whose light did shine
Like a fiend 's hope upon his lips and eyne

To stand alone , when kings and soldiers fear
A woman ? Heaven has sent its other victim here

Bind her , and on my head the burden lay
Of her just torments : -- at the Judgement Day

An infidel ; but for me she would have known
Another moment 's joy ! the glory be thine own

Chased by the winds , those vacant streets among
Fled tameless , as the brazen rein she flung

The clasp of such a fearful death should woo
With smiles of tender joy as beamed from Cythna now

Frozen by doubt , -- alas ! they could not choose
But weep ; for when her faint limbs did refuse

Of her quick lips , even as a weary child
Wins sleep from some fond nurse with its caresses mild

She smiled on me , and nothing then we said
But each upon the other 's countenance fed

Was almost rent , the world grew dim and pale
All light in Heaven or Earth beside our love did fail.

Burst upwards , hurling fiercely from the ground
The globed smoke , -- I heard the mighty sound

The tyrant 's child fall without life or motion
Before his throne , subdued by some unseen emotion.

The music of a breath-suspending song
Which , like the kiss of love when life is young

Till on my passive soul there seemed to creep
A melody , like waves on wrinkled sands that leap

Of a clear pool , upon a bank o'ertwined
With strange and star-bright flowers , which to the wind

Whose moonlike blooms and bright fruit overhead
A shadow , which was light , upon the waters shed

And where the flood its own bright margin laves
Their echoes talk with its eternal waves

Till through a chasm of hills they roll , and feed
A river deep , which flies with smooth but arrowy speed

Its rapid keel -- a winged shape sate there
A child with silver-shining wings , so fair

Light , as from starry beams ; from side to side
While veering to the wind her plumes the bark did guide

Horned on high , like the young moon supine
When o'er dim twilight mountains dark with pine

Fade fast , till borne on sunlight 's ebbing streams
Dilating , on earth 's verge the sunken meteor gleams

Than happy love , a wild and glad surprise
Glanced as she spake : 'Ay , this is Paradise

Of madness came , like day to one benighted
In lonesome woods : my heart is now too well requited

Which , as she leaned in passion 's silence there
Breathed warmth on the cold bosom of the air

Fell o'er that snowy child , and wrapped from sight
The fond and long embrace which did their hearts unite

When once we met , yet knew that I was thine
From the same hour in which thy lips divine

Thine image with HER memory dear -- again
We meet ; exempted now from mortal fear or pain

And hid mine eyes in dust , and far astray
My mind was gone , when bright , like dawning day

`` They wait for thee , beloved ! '' -- then I knew
The death-mark on my breast , and became calm anew

The pitchy smoke of the departed fire
Still hung in many a hollow dome and spire

The armies stood ; a vacancy was made
In expectation 's depth , and so they stood dismayed

And said -- '' The flood of time is rolling on
We stand upon its brink , whilst THEY are gone

Who might have made this life 's envenomed dream
A sweeter draught than ye will ever taste , I deem

Yon smoke has faded from the firmament
Even for this cause , that ye who must lament

To man the wisdom of a high despair
When such can die , and he live on and linger here

In pain and fire have unbelievers gone
And ye must sadly turn away , and moan

And slowly shall its memory , ever burning
Fill this dark night of things with an eternal morning

How those who love , yet fear not , dare to die
Tell to your children this ! '' Then suddenly

There came a murmur from the crowd , to tell
Of deep and mighty change which suddenly befell

The strength of its dominion , good and great
The better Genius of this world 's estate

Calm dwellings of the free and happy dead
Where I am sent to lead ! ' These winged words she said

Above her head those plumes of dazzling hue
Into the winds ' invisible stream she threw

O'er the bright whirlpools of that fountain fair
Whose shores receded fast , while we seemed lingering there

As swift as twinkling beams , had , under Heaven
From woods and waves wild sounds and odours driven

We sailed along the winding watery ways
Of the vast stream , a long and labyrinthine maze

Its whirlpools , where all hues did spread and quiver
And where melodious falls did burst and shiver

Or when the moonlight poured a holier day
One vast and glittering lake around green islands lay

Which flieth forth and can not make abode
Sometimes through forests , deep like night , we glode

The homes of the departed , dimly frowned
O'er the bright waves which girt their dark foundations round

Over the grass ; sometimes beneath the night
Of wide and vaulted caves , whose roofs were bright

Amid sweet sounds across our path would sweep
Like swift and lovely dreams that walk the waves of sleep

And in quick smiles whose light would come and go
Like music o'er wide waves , and in the flow

That virtue , though obscured on Earth , not less
Survives all mortal change in lasting loveliness

New changes and new glories , rolled on high
Sun , Moon and moonlike lamps , the progeny

The stream became , and fast and faster bare
The spirit-winged boat , steadily speeding there

The thunder of whose earth-uplifting roar
Made the air sweep in whirlwinds from the shore

Amid the topmost spray , and sunbows wild
Wreathed in the silver mist : in joy and pride we smiled

When its wild surges with the lake were blended
Our bark hung there , as on a line suspended

By mists , aye feed ; from rocks and clouds they break
And of that azure sea a silent refuge make

And in the midst , afar , even like a sphere
Hung in one hollow sky , did there appear

Like the swift moon this glorious earth around
The charmed boat approached , and there its haven found

And ever changing , like a joyless eye
That finds no object worth its constancy

Floats though unseen among us , Ã‘visiting
This various world with as inconstant wing

As summer winds that creep from flower to flower , Ã‘
Like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain shower

It visits with inconstant glance
Each human heart and countenance

Like clouds in starlight widely spread , Ã‘
Like memory of music fled , Ã‘

Like aught that for its grace may be
Dear , and yet dearer for its mystery

With thine own hues all thou dost shine upon
Of human thought or form , Ã‘where art thou gone

Why dost thou pass away and leave our state
This dim vast vale of tears , vacant and desolate

Ask why the sunlight not for ever
Weaves rainbows oÃ•er yon mountain-river

Why fear and dream and death and birth
Cast on the daylight of this earth

Such gloom , Ã‘why man has such a scope
For love and hate , despondency and hope

To sage or poet these responses givenÃ‘
Therefore the names of Demon , Ghost , and Heaven

Remain the records of their vain endeavour
Frail spellsÃ‘whose uttered charm might not avail to sever

From all we hear and all we see
Doubt , chance , and mutability

Or music by the night-wind sent
Through strings of some still instrument

Or moonlight on a midnight stream
Gives grace and truth to lifeÃ•s unquiet dream

And come , for some uncertain moments lent
Man were immortal , and omnipotent

Didst thou , unknown and awful as thou art
Keep with thy glorious train firm state within his heart

Thou messenger of sympathies
That wax and wane in loversÃ• eyesÃ‘

Like darkness to a dying flame
Depart not as thy shadow came

Depart notÃ‘lest the grave should be
Like life and fear , a dark reality

Through many a listening chamber , cave and ruin
And starlight wood , with fearful steps pursuing

Hopes of high talk with the departed dead
I called on poisonous names with which our youth is fed

I was not heardÃ‘I saw them notÃ‘
When musing deeply on the lot

All vital things that wake to bring
News of birds and blossoming , Ã‘

Sudden , thy shadow fell on me
I shrieked , and clasped my hands in ecstasy

To thee and thineÃ‘have I not kept the vow
With beating heart and streaming eyes , even now

I call the phantoms of a thousand hours
Each from his voiceless grave : they have in visioned bowers

Of studious zeal or loveÃ•s delight
Outwatched with me the envious nightÃ‘

Unlinked with hope that thou wouldst free
This world from its dark slavery

That thouÃ‘O awful LOVELINESS
Wouldst give whateÃ•er these words can not express

When noon is pastÃ‘there is a harmony
In autumn , and a lustre in its sky

Which through the summer is not heard or seen
As if it could not be , as if it had not been

Thus let thy power , which like the truth
Of nature on my passive youth

Its calmÃ‘to one who worships thee
And every form containing thee

Whom , SPIRIT fair , thy spells did bind
To fear himself , and love all human kind

Wild Spirit , which art moving everywhereÃ‘
Destroyer and PreserverÃ‘hear , O hear

Of vapours , from whose solid atmosphere
Black rain , and fire , and hail will burst : Ã‘O hear

Thy voice , and suddenly grow gray with fear
And tremble and despoil themselves : Ã‘O hear

A heavy weight of hours has chain 'd and bowed
One too like theeÃ‘tameless , and swift , and proud

The trumpet of a prophecy ! O Wind
If Winter comes , can Spring be far behind

Pourest thy full heart
In profuse strains of unpremeditated art

The blue deep thou wingest
And singing still dost soar , and soaring ever singest

Thou dost float and run
Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun

In the broad daylight
Thou art unseen , but yet I hear thy shrill delightÃ‘

In the white dawn clear
Until we hardly see , we feel that it is there

From one lonely cloud
The moon rains out her beams , and heaven is overflowed

Drops so bright to see
As from thy presence showers a rain of melody : Ã‘

Till the world is wrought
To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not

Soul in secret hour
With music sweet as love , which overflows her bower

Its a â€˜ rial hue
Among the flowers and grass which screen it from the view

Till the scent it gives
Makes faint with too much sweet those heavy-wingÂd thieves

All that ever was
Joyous and clear and freshÃ‘thy music doth surpass

Praise of love or wine
That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine

But an empty vauntÃ‘
A thin wherein we feel there is some hidden want

What shapes of sky or plain
What love of thine own kind ? what ignorance of pain

Never came near thee
Thou lovest , but ne'er knew love 's sad satiety

Than we mortals dream
Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream

With some pain is fraught
Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought

Not to shed a tear
I know not how thy joy we ever should come near

That in books are found
Thy skill to poet were , thou scorner of the ground

From my lips would flow
The world should listen then , as I am listening now

Biting my trewand pen , beating myselfe for spite
Fool , said my Muse to me , looke in thy heart , and write

Loue gaue the wound , which , while I breathe , will bleede
But knowne worth did in tract of time proceed

Till by degrees , it had full conquest got
I saw and lik 'd ; I lik 'd but loued not

I lou 'd , but straight did not what Loue decreed
At length , to Loues decrees I , forc 'd , agreed

To make myselfe beleeue that all is well
While , with a feeling skill , I paint my hell

For me , in sooth , no Muse but one I know
Phrases and problems from my reach do grow

How then ? euen thus : in Stellaes face I reed
What Loue and Beautie be ; then all my deed

But if that needes thou wilt vsurping be
The little reason that is left in me

I sweare , my heart such one shall show to thee
That shrines in flesh so true a deitie

Rebels to nature , striue for their owne smart
It is most true , what we call Cupids dart

And should in soule up to our countrey moue
True , and yet true that I must Stella loue

Of liuing deaths , dere wounds , faire storms , and freesing fires
Some one his song in Ioue and Ioues strange tales attires

To some a sweetest plaint a sweetest stile affords
While teares poure out his inke , and sighes breathe out his words

I can speake what I feele , and feele as much as they
But thinke that all the map of my state I display

Plac 'd euer there , gaue him this mourning weede
To honour all their deaths who for her bleed

Doubt you to whom my Muse these notes entendeth
Which now my breast , surcharg 'd , to musick lendeth

Who hath the eyes which marrie state with pleasure
Who keeps the key of Natures cheifest treasure

Who hath the lips , where wit in fairnesse raigneth
Who womankind at once both deckes and stayneth

Who hath the feet , whose step all sweetnesse planteth
Who else , for whom Fame worthy trumpets wanteth

Who hath the breast , whose milk doth patience nourish
Whose grace is such , that when it chides doth cherish

Who hath the hand which , without stroke , subdueth
Who long-dead beautie with increase reneueth

Who hath the haire , which , loosest , fastest tieth
Who makes a man liue , then glad when he dieth

Who hath the voyce , which soule from sences thunders
Whose force , but yours , the bolts of beautie thunders

Doubt you , to whome my Muse these notes intendeth
Which now my breast , oercharg 'd , to musicke lendeth

Teaching Sleepe most faire to be
Now will I teach her that she

The two only darts of Loue
Now will I , with that Boy , proue

Giuing frankly niggard no
Now will I attempt to know

Sleeping , grants a free resort
Now I will inuade the fort

Of her iust and high disdaine
Now will I , alas , refraine

Do inuite a stealing kisse
Now will I but venture this

Lowring beautie chastens me
Now will I for feare hence flee

If Orpheus voyce had force to breathe such musickes loue
Through pores of senceles trees , as it could make them moue

If stones good measure daunc 'd , the Theban walles to build
To cadence of the tunes which Amphions lyre did yeeld

More cause a like effect at least-wise bringeth
O stones , O trees , learne hearing , -- Stella singeth

If loue might sweeten so a boy of shepheard brood
To make a lyzard dull , to taste loues dainty food

If eagle fierce could so in Grecian mayde delight
As her eyes were his light , her death his endlesse night

Earth gaue that loue ; heau'n , I trow , loue refineth
O birds , O beasts , looke loue ( lo ) Stella shineth

The beasts , birds , stones , and trees feele this , and , feeling , loue
And if the trees nor stones stirre not the same to proue

Nor beasts nor birds do come vnto this blessed gaze
Know that small loue is quicke , and great loue doth amaze

They are amaz 'd , but you with reason armed
O eyes , O eares of men , how you are charmed

Onely Ioy , now here you are
Fit to heare and ease my care

Let my whispering voyce obtaine
Sweete reward for sharpest paine

Take me to thee , and thee to mee
No , no , no , no , my Deare , let bee

Night hath closde all in her cloke
Twinkling starres loue-thoughts prouoke

Danger hence , good care doth keepe
Iealouzie hemselfe doth sleepe

Take me to thee , and thee to mee
No , no , no , no , my Deare , let bee

Better place no wit can finde
Cupids knot to loose or binde

These sweet flowers our fine bed too
Vs in their best language woo

Take me to thee , and thee to mee
No , no , no , no , my Deare , let bee

This small light the moone bestowes
Serues thy beames but to disclose

So to raise my hap more hie
Feare not else , none vs can spie

Take me to thee , and thee to mee
No , no , no , no , my Deare , let bee

That you heard was but a mouse
Dumbe Sleepe holdeth all the house

Yet asleepe , me thinkes they say
Yong fooles take time while you may

Take me to thee , and thee to mee
No , no , no , no , my Deare , let bee

Niggard time threates , if we misse
This large offer of our blisse

Long stay , ere he graunt the same
Sweet , then , while ech thing doth frame

Take me to thee , and thee to mee
No , no , no , no , my Deare , let bee

Your faire Mother is abed
Candles out and curtaines spred

She thinkes you do letters write
Write , but first let me endite

Take me to thee , and thee to mee
No , no , no , no , my Deare , let bee

Sweete , alas , why striue you thus
Concord better fitteth vs

Leaue to Mars the force of hands
Your power in your beautie stands

Take me to thee , and thee to mee
No , no , no , no , my Deare , let bee

Wo to mee , and do you sweare
Me to hate , but I forbeare

Cursed be my destines all
That brought me so high to fall

Soone with my death I will please thee
No , no , no , no , my Deare , let bee

While fauour fed my hope , delight with hope was brought
Thought waited on delight , and speech did follow thought

I thought all words were lost that were not spent of thee
I thought each place was darke but where thy lights would be

I said thou wert most faire , and so indeed thou art
I said thou wert most sweet , sweet poison to my heart

I said thine eyes were starres , thy breast the milken way
Thy fingers Cupids shafts , thy voyce the angels lay

But now that hope is lost , vnkindnesse kils delight
Yet thought and speech do liue , though metamorphos 'd quite

I thinke now of thy faults , who late thought of thy praise
That speech falles now to blame , which did thy honour raise

Then thou , whom partiall heauens conspird in one to frame
The proofe of Beauties worth , th'inheritrix of fame

See now those feathers pluckt , wherewith thou flew'st most high
See what cloudes of reproach shall dark thy honours skie

And , O my muse , though oft you luld her in your lap
And then a heau'nly Child , gaue her Ambrosian pap

Since she , disdaining me , doth you in me disdaine
Suffer not her to laugh , while both we suffer paine

Your client , poore my selfe , shall Stella handle so
Reuenge ! revenge ! my Muse ! defiance trumpet blow

Ah , my sute granted is , I feele my breast doth swell
No , child , a lesson new you shall begin to spell

Thinke now no more to heare of warme fine-odour 'd snow
Nor blushing Lillies , nor pearles Ruby-hidden row

But of thy soule , so fraught with such vngratefulnesse
As where thou soone might'st helpe , most faith dost most oppresse

Yet worse then worst , I say thou art a Theefe , A theefe
Now God forbid ! a theefe ! and of wurst theeues the cheefe

But thou , rich in all ioyes , dost rob my ioyes from me
Which can not be restord by time or industrie

Yet -- gentle English theeues do rob , but will not slay
Thou English murdring theefe , wilt haue harts for thy prey

And euen while I do speake , my death wounds bleeding be
Which , I protest , proceed from only cruell thee

But murder , priuate fault , seemes but a toy to thee
I lay then to thy charge vniustest tyrannie

For thou dost lord my heart , who am not borne thy slaue
And , which is worse , makes me , most guiltlesse , torments haue

Lo , you grow proud with this , for Tyrans make folke bow
Of foule rebellion then I do appeach thee now

Thou , sweetest subiect wert , borne in the realme of Loue
And yet against thy prince thy force dost daily proue

But valiant Rebels oft in fooles mouths purchase fame
I now then staine thy white with vagabonding shame

For wearing Venus badge in euery part of thee
Vnto Dianaes traine thou , runnaway , didst flie

What , is not this enough ! nay , farre worse commeth here
A witch , I say , thou art , though thou so faire appeare

But I in me am chang 'd , I am aliue and dead
My feete are turn 'd to rootes , my hart becommeth lead

Yet witches may repent ; thou art farre worse then they
Alas that I am forst such euill of thee to say

For thy face tempts my soule to leaue the heauens for thee
And thy words of refuse do powre euen hell on mee

You , then , vngrateful theefe , you murdring Tyran , you
You rebell runaway , to lord and lady vntrue

You see what I can say ; mend yet your froward mind
And such skill in my Muse , you , reconcil 'd , shall find

Feare not to iudge this bate
For it is void of hate

The barre to plead their right
Is only true delight

That each , while each contends
It selfe to other lends

The perfect beauties be
A perfect harmony

A friend each party draws
To countenance his cause

But both to both so bent
As both in both are spent

Both in their obiects such
As no exceptions tutch

He layes on this chiefe praise
Chiefe praise on that he laies

Say whether thou wilt crowne
With limitlesse renowne

Whose senses in so euill consort their stepdame Nature laies
That rauishing delight in them most sweete tunes do not raise

Or if they do delight therein , yet are so closde with wit
As with ententious lips to set a title vaine on it

O let them heare these sacred tunes , and learne in Wonders scholes
To be , in things past bounds of wit , fooles : if they be not fooles

Who haue so leaden eyes , as not to see sweet Beauties show
Or , seeing , haue so wooden wits , as not that worth to know

Or , knowing , haue so muddy minds , as not to be in loue
Or , louing , haue so frothy thoughts , as eas'ly thence to moue

O let them see these heau'nly beames , and in faire letters reede
A lesson fit , both sight and skill , loue and firme loue to breede

Heare then , but then with wonder heare , see , but adoring , see
No mortall gifts , no earthly fruites , now here descended be

See , doo you see this face ? a face , nay , image of the skies
Of which the two life-giuing lights are figur 'd in her eyes

Heare you this soule-inuading voice , and count it but a voice
The very essence of their tunes , when angels do reioyce

In a groue most rich of shade
Where birds wanton musicke made

Maie , then yong , his pide weedes showing
New-perfum 'd with flowers fresh growing

Astrophel with Stella sweet
Did for mutual comfort meete

Both within themselues oppressed
But each in the other blessed

Him great harmes had taught much care
Her faire necke a foule yoke bare

But her sight his cares did banish
In his sight her yoke did vanish

Wept they had , alas , the while
But now teares themselues did smile

While their eyes , by Loue directed
Enterchangeably reflected

Sigh they did ; but now betwixt
Sighes of woe were glad sighes mixt

With arms crost , yet testifying
restlesse rest , and liuing dying

Their eares hungrie of each word
Which the deare tongue would afford

But their tongues restrain 'd from walking
Till their harts had ended talking

But when their tongues could not speake
Loue it selfe did silence breake

Loue did set his lips asunder
Thus to speake in loue and wonder

Stella , Soueraigne of my ioy
Faire triumpher of annoy

Stella , Starre of heauenly fier
Stella , loadstar of desier

Stella , in whose shining eyes
Are the lights of Cupids skies

Whose beames , where they once are darted
Loue therewith is streight imparted

Stella , whose voice when it speakes
Senses all asunder breakes

Stella , whose voice , when it singeth
Angels to acquaintance bringeth

Stella , in whose body is
Writ each caracter of blisse

Whose face all , all beauty passeth
Saue thy mind , which it surpasseth

Graunt , O graunt ; but speach , alas
Failes me , fearing on to passe

Graunt , O me : what am I saying
But no fault there is in praying

Graunt ( O Deere ) on knees I pray
( Knees on ground he then did stay

That , not I , but since I loue you
Time and place for me may moue you

Neuer season was more fit
Never roome more apt for it

Smiling ayre allowes my reason
These birds sing , Now vse the season

This small wind , which so sweete is
See how it the leaues doth kisse

Each tree in his best attiring
Sense of Loue to Loue inspiring

Loue makes earth the water drink
Loue to earth makes water sinke

And , if dumbe things be so witty
Shall a heauenly Grace want pitty

There his hands , in their speech , faine
Would haue made tongues language plaine

But her hands , his hands repelling
Gaue repulse all grace expelling

Then she spake ; her speech was such
So not eares , but hart did tuch

While such-wise she loue denied
And yet loue she signified

Astrophel , sayd she , my loue
Cease , in these effects , to proue

Now be still , yet still beleeue me
Thy griefe more then death would grieue me

If that any thought in me
Can tast comfort but of thee

Let me , fed with hellish anguish
Ioylesse , hopelesse , endlesse languish

If those eyes you praised be
Halfe so deare as you to me

Let me home returne , starke blinded
Of those eyes , and blinder minded

If to secret of my hart
I do any wish impart

Where thou art not formost placed
Be both wish and I defaced

If more may be sayd , I say
All my blisse in thee I lay

If thou loue , my loue , content thee
For all loue , all faith is meant thee

Trust me , while I thee deny
In my selfe the smart I try

Tyran Honour doth thus vse thee
Stellas selfe might not refuse thee

Therefore , deare , this no more moue
Least , though I leaue not thy loue

Which too deep in me is framed
I should blush when thou art named

Therewithall away she went
Leauing him to passion rent

With what she had done and spoken
That therewith my song is broken

Fro the stormes in my breast breeding
And showers from mine eyes proceeding

Vnto whom mirth is displeasure
Onely rich in mischiefs treasure

Sorrow only then hath glory
When 't is excellently sorry

Though against me she perseuer
Though I blisse enherit neuer

Then can in good eawes be moued
Toward Lambkins best beloued

While in pride flowers be preserued
Himselfe onely Winter-sterued

Coles of loue that burne so cleerly
And yet leaue me helplesse meerely

My loue should not be beleeued
But he were by me releeued

All her hate , death soone would seaze me
And of hideous torments ease me

Tell her , in your pitious blaying
Her poore Slaues vniust decaying

O deare Life , when shall it bee
That mine eyes thine eyes shall see

Whether absence haue had force
thy remembrance to diuorce

Or if I my self find not
After parting aught forgot

Let not tongue aspire to tell
In what high ioyes I shall dwell

Thought , therefore , I will send thee
To take vp the place for me

There vnseene , thou mayst be bold
Those faire wonders to behold

Thought , see thou no place forbeare
Enter brauely euerywhere

But if thou wouldst garded be
Fearing her beames , take with thee

Thinke of that most gratefull time
When my leaping heart will climb

There those roses for to kisse
Which do breathe a sugred blisse

Thinke of my most princely pow ' r
Which I blessed shall deuow ' r

Beauty , musicke , sweetnesse , loue
While she doth against me proue

Thinke , thinke of those dalyings
When with doue-like murmurings

We change eyes , and hart for hart
Each to other do depart

O my Thoughts , my Thoughts surcease
Thy delights my woes increse

Thinke no more , but die in me
Till thou shalt reuiued be

Fair choice I have , either to live or die
A blinded mole , or else a burnÃƒÂ¨d fly

And in my woundes , my flames , and bondes , I fynd
A salue , freshe ayre , and bryghte contented mynde

In humble mind , a constant faith to proue
But , for all this , I can not her remoue

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’I neuer did my vowÃƒÂ¨d word forsake
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’For why should I , whom free choise slaue doth make

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Tell how ill thought disgrac 'd my doing well
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Tell how my ioyes and hopes thus fowly fell

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’A horse 's worth laid wast the Troian ground
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’A three-foote stoole in Greece made trumpets sound

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Should ladies faire be tyed to such hard lawes
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’As in their moodes to take a lingring pawse

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’To paint my liuing death and endlesse smart
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’And so for one that felt god Cupid 's dart

Who think themselues well blest if they renew
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Some good old dumpe that Chaucer 's mistresse knew

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’And in my braine some sacred humour flowe
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’That all the earth my woes , sighs , teares may know

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’That only I the only mistresse had
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’But now , if ere my face with ioy be clad

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Who , stoick-like , in clowdie hew appeare
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Who silence force to make their words more deare

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Beleeue them not ; for physick true doth finde
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Cholor adust is ioyed in woman-kinde

Dick , since we can not dance , come , let a chearefull voyce
Shew that we do not grudge at all when others do rejoyce

Ah Will ! though I grudge not , I count it feeble glee
With sight made dymme with dayly teares , another 's sport to see

Whoeuer lambkins saw ( yet lambkins loue to play
To play when that their louÃƒÂ¨d dammes are stoln or gone astray

If this in them be true , as true in men think I
A lustles song , forsooth , thinks hee , that hath more lust to cry

A tyme there is for all , my mother often sayes
When she , with skirts tuckt very hy , with girles at stoolball playes

When thou hast mynd to weepe , seeke out some smoky room
Now let those lightsomme sights we see thy darknes ouercome

What ioy the ioyfull sunne giues vnto blearÃƒÂ¨d eyes
That comfort in these sports you like , my mynde his comfort tryes

What ! is thy bagpipe broke , or are thy lambs miswent
Thy wallet or thy tar-box lost ; or thy new rayment rent

I would it were but thus ; for thus it were too well
Thou see'st my eares do itch at it : good Dick , thy sorow tell

Hear , then , and learne to sigh : a mistress I do serue
Whose wages makes me beg the more , who feeds me till I sterue

Whose lyuerie 's such as most I freeze apparelled most
And lookes so neere vnto my cure , that I must needes be lost

What ! these are riddles , sure ; art thou , then , bound to her
Bound , as I neither power haue , nor would haue power , to stir

Remembrance is the chest
Lockte fast with knowing that she is of worldly things the best

Thou late of wages playnd'st : what wages mayst thou haue
Her heauenly looks , which more and more do giue me cause to craue

If wages make you want , what food is that she giues
Teares ' drink , sorrowe 's meat , wherewith not I , but in me my death liues

Hir care is to preuent
My freedom , with show of hir beames , with virtue , my content

God shield vs from such dames ! If so our downes be sped
The shepheards will grow leane , I trow ; their sheep will ill be fed

But , Dick , my counsell marke : run from the place of woe
The arrow being shot from far doth giue the smaller blowe

Good Will , I can not take thy good aduice : before
That foxes leaue to steale , because they finde they dy therefore

Then , Dick , let vs go hence , lest wee great folkes annoy
For nothing can more tedious bee then plaint in time of joy

Oh hence ! O cruell word ! which euen doggs do hate
But hence , euen hence I must needes go ; such is my doggÃƒÂ¨d fate

Walking in bright PhÃ… â€œ bus ' blaze
Where with heat oppresst I was

I got to a shady wood
Where greene leaues did newly bud

And of grass was plenty dwelling
Deckt with pyde flowers sweetely smelling

In this wood a man I met
On lamenting wholly set

Rewing change of wonted state
Whence he was transformÃƒÂ¨d late

Once to shepheards ' God retayning
Now in servile Court remayning

There he wandring , malecontent
Vp and down perplexÃƒÂ¨d went

Daring not to tell to mee
Spake vnto a senceless tree

One among the rest electing
These same words , or this effecting

Ã¢â‚¬ËœMy old mates I grieue to see
b Voyde of me in field to bee

Where we once our louely sheepe
Louingly like friends did keepe

Oft each other 's friendship prouing
Neuer striuing but in louing

But may loue abiding bee
In poore shepheards ' base degree

It belongs to such alone
To whom arte of loue is knowne

Seely shepheards are not witting
What in art of loue is fitting

Nay , what neede the arte to those
To whom we our loue disclose

It is to be vsÃƒÂ¨d then
When we doe but flatter men

Friendship true , in hart assurÃƒÂ¨d
Is by Nature 's giftes procurÃƒÂ¨d

Therefore shepheardes , wanting skill
Can loue 's duties best fulfill

Since they know not how to faine
Nor with loue to cloake disdaine

Like the wiser sort , whose learning
Hides their inward will of harming

Well was I , while vnder shade
Oten reedes me musicke made

Striuing with my mates in song
Mixing mirth our songs among

Greater was the shepheard 's treasure
Then this false , fine , courtly pleasure

Where , how many creatures be
So many pufft in minde I see

Like to Junoe 's birdes of pride
Scarce each other can abide

Friends like to blacke swannes appearing
Sooner these than those in hearing

Therefore , Pan , if thou mayst be
Made to listen vnto me

Grant , I say ( if seely man
May make treaty to god Pan

That I , without thy denying
May be still to thee relying

Only for my two loues ' sake
In whose loue I pleasure take

Only two do me delight
With their euer-pleasing sight

Of all men to thee retaining
Grant me with those two remaining

So shall I to thee alwayes
With my reedes sound mighty praise

And first lambe that shall befall
Yearely deck thine alter shall

If it please thee be reflected
And I from thee not reiected.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢

So I left him in that place
Taking pity on his case

Learning this among the rest
That the meane estate is best

Better fillÃƒÂ¨d with contenting
Voyde of wishing and repenting

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’For nothing , time nor place , can loose , quench , ease
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Mine owne , embracÃƒÂ¨d , sought , knot , fire , disease

How dare I , wretch , seek there my woes to rest
Where ears be burnt , eyes dazzled , hearts oppressed

So dare I , wretch , my bashful fear subdue
And feed mine ears , mine eyes , my heart in you

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Great sure is she , on whom our hopes do live
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Greater is she who must the judgement give

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Sweet soul , to whom I vowed am a slave
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Let not wild woods so great a treasure have

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Sweet soul , let not a wretch that serveth sheep
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Among his flock so sweet a treasure keep

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’But still take heed , lest thou thyself submit
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’To one that hath no wealth , and wants his wit

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’But take this beast , if beasts you fear to miss
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’For of his beasts the greatest beast he is

Espilus . Judge you , to whom all beauty 's force is lent
Therion . Judge you of love , to whom all love is bent

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Ã¢â‚¬ËœNothing , Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ said he , Ã¢â‚¬Ëœfor most I joy in this
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’That goddess mine my blessed being sees.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Ã¢â‚¬ËœPoor Pan , Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ he said , Ã¢â‚¬Ëœalthough thou beaten be
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’It is no shame , since Hercules was he.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢

Therion . Thus woeful I in woe this salve do find
My foul mishap came yet from fairest mind

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Then farewell , world ; thy uttermost I see
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Eternal love , maintain thy life in me

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Ã¢â‚¬Æ’O happy dove , if she no bondage tried
Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Ã¢â‚¬Æ’More happy I , might I in bondage bide

But underneath the shadow of thy wings
Give warmth to these young-hatched orphan things

They which have tasted of the muses ' spring
I hope will smile upon the tunes they sing

Before her feathers have their full perfection
She soars aloft , pricked on by blind affection

Intentions leading to a more effect
If you them grace but with your mild aspect

Vouchsafe to read these lines both harsh and bad
Nuntiates of woe with sorrow being clad

O Chloris , weigh the task I undertake
Thy beauty subject of my song I make

Which eyes , which beauty , which bright crystal beam
Which face of thine hath made my love extreme

There underneath that dark and dusky bower
Whole showers of tears to Chloris I will pour

That neither tears , nor sighs , nor streaming blood
Can unto mercy move her cruel mood

Either cause cruel Chloris to relent
Or let me die upon the wound she sent

Resounding echoes from their obscure caves
Reiterate what most my fancy craves

How much more fair by so much more unkind
Than Syrinx coy , or Daphne , I her find

There did I call to her , ah too unkind
But tiger-like , of me she had no mind

But she regarding neither tears nor moan
Flies from the fountain leaving me alone

Why should she then that soul with sorrow fill
Which vowed hath to love and serve her still

She doth thy temples and thy shrines abject
They with Amintas ' flowers by me are decked

And still she scorns one favouring smile to show
Unto those waves proceeding from my woe

But I could neither my fair Chloris view
Nor yet the satyr which erstwhile I slew

Thy swan-like songs did show thy dying anguish
These weeping truce-men show I living languish

They cease to feed and listen to the plaint
Which I pour forth unto a cruel saint

Thus do I pass my ling'ring life in woe
But when my bliss will come I do not know

O what is't not poor I would undertake
If labour could my peace with Chloris make

Matchless for beauty nature hath thee framed
Only unkind and cruel thou art named

She like the scorpion gave to me a wound
And like the scorpion she must make me sound

That nymph unto my clamors doth reply
Being likewise scorned in love as well as I

She pitying me , part of my woes doth bear
As you , good shepherds , listening now shall hear

So shall you add such courage to my love
That fortune false my faith shall not remove

Her eyes revive decaying life in me
Though they augmenters of my thraldom be

Then all too late my death thou wilt repent
When murther 's guilt thy conscience shall torment

Thus may we see how love doth rule and reigns
Bringing those under which his power disdains

Then wilt thou think upon poor Corin 's case
Who loved thee dear , yet lived in thy disgrace

O Love , leave off with sorrow to torment me
Let my heart 's grief and pining pain content thee

The breach is made , I give thee leave to enter
Thee to resist , great god , I dare not venter

Restless desire doth aggravate mine anguish
Careful conceits do fill my soul with languish

Be not too cruel in thy conquest gained
Thy deadly shafts hath victory obtained

Batter no more my fort with fierce affection
But shield me captive under thy protection

I yield to thee , O Love , thou art the stronger
Raise then thy siege and trouble me no longer

So that thy darlings me to be may know
The true idea of all worldly woe

And I will triumph still amidst my woe
Till mercy shall my sorrows overflow

So hard and dry is my saint 's cruel mind
These waves no way in her to sink can find

Although Erynnis hinders Hymen 's rites
My fixed faith against oblivion fights

But still do joy amidst their misery
With patience bearing love 's captivity

And what I say I ever will approve
No joy may be compared to thy love

That day and night to me are always one
Consumed in woe , in tears , in sighs and moan

More rich , more rare , more worth her love I prize
Then all the wealth which under heaven lies

Then sith no mercy he shows to his mother
We meekly must his force and rigour smother

Thus hath fond love bereft my youthful years
Of all good hap before old age appears

But burst , poor heart , thou hast no better hope
Since all thy senses have no further scope

Only a woman if she list not love
No art , nor force , can unto pity move

Which by experience now too well I prove
There is no pain unto the pains of love

And never none shall write with truer mind
As by all proof and trial you shall find

Let sable night all your disgraces cover
Yet truer sighs were never sighed by lover

And time shall come as yet unknown to men
When I more large thy praises forth shall pen

And what I sing shall always be of thee
As long as life or breath remains in me

But Mars , according to his stubborn kind
No virtue gave , but a disdainful mind

O Chloris , if thou then saw'st them and me
I 'm sure thou wouldst both pity them and me

All these I know that thou dost know too well
But of thy heart too cruel I thee tell

Nor never shall till you renew again
The mutual love which did possess us twain

Else thus I prize thee : Chloris is alone
More hard than gold or pearl or precious stone

Of which there now remaines no memorie
Nor anie little moniment to see

By which the trauailer , that fares that way
This once was she , may warned be to say

About her shoulders careleslie downe trailing
And streames of teares from her faire eyes forth railing

In her right hand a broken rod she held
Which towards heauen shee seemd on high to weld

Which draw the dayes of men forth in extent
Or th'auncient Genius of that Citie brent

But seeing her so piteouslie perplexed
I ( to her calling ) askt what her so vexed

From highest staire to lowest step me draue
And haue in mine owne bowels made my graue

That of all Nations now I am forlorne
The worlds sad spectacle , and fortunes scorne

That shedding teares a while I still did rest
And after did her name of her request

Name haue I none ( quoth she ) nor anie being
Bereft of both by Fates vniust decreeing

Though nought at all but ruines now I bee
And lye in mine owne ashes , as ye see

Verlame I was ; what bootes it that I was
Sith now I am but weedes and wastfull gras

Tast no one hower of happines or merth
But like as at the ingate of their berth

They crying creep out of their mothers woomb
So wailing backe go to their wofull toomb

With so great labour and long lasting paine
As if his daies for euer should remaine

Sith all that in this world is great or gaie
Doth as a vapour vanish , and decaie

Which of all wisedome knew the perfect somme
Where those great warriors , which did ouercomme

The world with conquest of their might and maine
And made one meare of th'earth and of their raine

Whose memorie is quite worne out with yeares
Who of the Grecian Libbard now ought heares

That ouerran the East with greedie powre
And left his whelps their kingdomes to deuoure

And in the necke of all the world did ride
Where doth she all that wondrous welth nowe hide

With her own weight down pressed now shee lies
And by her heaps her hugenesse testifies

Deignd to behold me , and their gifts bestowe
The picture of thy pride in pompous shew

And of the whole world as thou wast the Empresse
So I of this small Northerne world was Princesse

That by my foes are now all spent and gone
To tell my forces matchable to none

Were but lost labour , that few would beleeue
And with rehearsing would me more agreeue

Sure gates , sweete gardens , stately galleries
Wrought with faire pillours , and fine imageries

All those ( O pitie ) now are turnd to dust
And ouergrowen with blacke obliuions rust

Ne Troynouant , though elder sister shee
With my great forces might compared bee

That stout Pendragon to his perill felt
Who in a siege seauen yeres about me dwelt

That lifting vp her braue heroÃ¢Ë†Å¡ÃƒËœck thought
Boue womens weaknes , with the Romanes fought

Fought , and in field against them thrice preuailed
Yet was she foyld , when as she me assailed

And prizde with slaughter of their Generall
The moniment of whose sad funerall

For wonder of the world , long in me lasted
But now to nought through spoyle of time is wasted

Is turnd to smoake , that doth to nothing fade
And of that brightnes now appeares no shade

But greislie shades , such as doo haunt in hell
With fearfull fiends , that in deep darknes dwell

For the Shriche-owle to build her balefull bowre
And where the Nightingale wont forth to powre

Her restles plaints , to comfort wakefull Louers
There now haunt yelling Mewes and whining Plouers

A thousand Nymphes , with mirthfull iollitee
Were wont to play , from all annoyance free

There now no riuers course is to be seene
But moorish fennes , and marshes euer greene

With which he saw my cruell foes me pained
And his pure streames with guiltles blood oft stained

From my vnhappie neighborhood farre fled
And his sweete waters away with him led

In that wide lake looking for plenteous praie
Of fish , which they with baits vsde to betraie

Is now no lake , nor anie fishers store
Nor euer ship shall saile there anie more

And mourne my fall with dolefull dreriment
Yet it is comfort in great languishment

To be bemoned with compassion kinde
And mitigates the anguish of the minde

To be remembred of posteritie
Saue One that maugre fortunes iniurie

And times decay , and enuies cruell tort
Hath writ my record in true-seeming sort

Buried in ruines , through the great outrage
Of her owne people , led with warlike rage

Cambden , though time all moniments obscure
Yet thy iust labours euer shall endure

And all my antique moniments defaced
Sith I doo dailie see things highest placed

So soone as fates their vitall thred haue shorne
Forgotten quite as they were neuer borne

And greatest ones did sue to gaine his grace
Of greatest ones he greatest in his place

Sate in the bosome of his Soueraine
And Right and loyall did his word maintaine

His dolefull fate , that late him loued deare
Scarse anie left to close his eylids neare

Scarse anie left vpon his lips to laie
The sacred sod , or Requiem to saie

When painted faces with smooth flattering
Doo fawne on you , and your wide praises sing

And when the courting masker louteth lowe
Him true in heart and trustie to you trow

And after death all friendship doth decaie
Therefore what euer man bearst worldlie sway

Liuing , on God , and on thy selfe relie
For when thou diest , all shall with thee die

And euill men now dead , his deeds vpbraid
Spite bites the dead , that liuing neuer baid

He now is gone , the whiles the Foxe is crept
Into the hole , the which the Badger swept

Which vanisht quite , so soone as it was sought
His name is worne alreadie out of thought

Ne anie Poet seekes him to reuiue
Yet manie Poets honourd him aliue

Of shepherd groomes , which wont his songs to praise
Praise who so list , yet I will him dispraise

Vntill he quite him of this guiltie blame
Wake shepheards boy , at length awake for shame

( For manie did , which doo it now denie
Awake , and to his Song a part applie

And I , the whilest you mourne for his decease
Will with my mourning plaints your plaint increase

And dead is now , as liuing , counted deare
Deare vnto all that true affection beare

But vnto thee most deare , O dearest Dame
His noble Spouse , and Paragon of fame

And dead , because him dead thou dost adore
As liuing , and thy lost deare loue deplore

So whilst that thou , faire flower of chastitie
Dost liue , by thee thy Lord shall neuer die

His worthie praise , and vertues dying neuer
Though death his soule doo from his bodie seuer

And thou thy selfe herein shalt also liue
Such grace the heauens doo to my verses giue

Whose great good deeds in countrey and in towne
Haue purchast him in heauen an happie crowne

Where he now liueth in eternall blis
And left his sonne t'ensue those steps of his

In learned artes and goodlie gouernaunce
That him to highest honour shall aduaunce

Braue Impe of Bedford , grow apace in bountie
And count of wisedome more than of thy Countie

Whose praises I to future age doo sing
And foorth out of her happie womb did bring

The sacred brood of learning and all honour
In whom the heauens powrde all their gifts vpon her

Appeared in their natiue propertis
And did enrich that noble breast of his

With treasure passing all this worldes worth
Worthie of heauen it selfe , which brought it forth

Fled backe too soone vnto his natiue place
Too soone for all that did his loue embrace

Too soone for all this wretched world , whom he
Robd of all right and true nobilitie

His bodie , as a spotles sacrifise
And chose , that guiltie hands of enemies

Should powre forth th'offring of his guiltles blood
So life exchanging for his countries good

With mortall cares , and cumbrous worlds anoy
But where thou dost that happines enioy

Bid me , O bid me quicklie come to thee
That happie there I maie thee alwaies see

By heauens doome doo ende my earthlie daies
Thereto doo thou my humble spirite raise

And into me that sacred breath inspire
Which thou there breathest perfect and entire

Sorrowing tempered with deare delight
That her to heare I feele my feeble spright

Robbed of sense , and rauished with ioy
O sad ioy made of mourning and anoy

And fields resownd , and flockes to leap and daunce
And shepheards leaue their lambs vnto mischaunce

To runne thy shrill Arcadian Pipe to heare
O happie were those dayes , thrice happie were

With Orpheus , and with Linus , and the choice
Of all that euer did in rimes reioyce

Conuersest , and doost heare their heauenlie layes
And they heare thine , and thine doo better praise

And now thee worship , mongst that blessed throng
Of heauenlie Poets and Heroes strong

So thou both here and there immortall art
And euerie where through excellent desart

Which neuer was , ne euer with regard
Their names shall of the later age be heard

But shall in rustie darknes euer lie
Vnles they mentiond be with infamie

Of former being in this mortall hous
But sleepes in dust dead and inglorious

Like beast , whose breath but in his nostrels is
And hath no hope of happinesse or blis

But as things wipt out with a sponge do perishe
Because they liuing , cared not to cherishe

No gentle wits , through pride or couetize
Which might their names for euer memorize

For they be daughters of Dame memorie
And Ioue the father of eternitie

And do those men in golden thrones repose
Whose merits they to glorifie do chose

To breake , and thence the soules to bring awaie
Out of dread darkenesse , to eternall day

And them immortall make , which els would die
In foule forgetfulnesse , and nameles lie

Had him consum 'd , and spent his vitall spirite
To highest heauen , where now he doth inherite

All happinesse in Hebes siluer bowre
Chosen to be her dearest Paramoure

To shew in Heauen his brightnes orient
And they , for pittie of the sad wayment

Which Orpheus for Eurydice did make
Her back againe to life sent for his sake

And power of death , they liue for aye aboue
Where mortall wreakes their blis may not remoue

But with the Gods , for former vertues meede
On Nectar and Ambrosia do feede

Recorded by the Muses , liue for ay
Ne may with storming showers be washt away

Ne bitter breathing windes with harmfull blast
Nor age , nor enuie shall them euer wast

Or brasen Pillours , neuer to be fired
Or Shrines , made of the mettall most desired

To make their memories for euer liue
For how can mortall immortalitie giue

Such one Lisippus , but is worne with raine
Such one King Edmond , but was rent for gaine

All such vaine moniments of earthlie masse
Deuour 'd of Time , in time to nought doo passe

Admir 'd of base-borne men from farre away
Then who so will with vertuous deeds assay

To mount to heauen , on Pegasus must ride
And with sweete Poets verse be glorifide

With verses , dipt in deaw of Castalie
Which made the Easterne Conquerour to crie

O fortunate yong-man , whose vertue found
So braue a Trompe , thy noble acts to sound

Deseruing neuer here to be forgot
In spight of enuie , that his deeds would spot

Since whose decease , learning lies vnregarded
And men of armes doo wander vnrewarded

Who whilome was aliue the wisest wight
But now his wisedome is disprooued quite

For he that now welds all things at his will
Scorns th'one and th'other in his deeper skill

And now broad spreading like an aged tree
Lets none shoot vp , that nigh him planted bee

O let the man , of whom the Muse is scorned
Nor aliue , nor dead be of the Muse adorned

O vainesse to be added to the rest
That do my soule with inward griefe infest

Let them behold the piteous fall of mee
And in my case their owne ensample see

Let him behold the horror of my fall
And his owne end vnto remembrance call

That of like ruine he may warned bee
And in himselfe be moou 'd to pittie mee

And all astonished with deepe dismay
For her departure , had no word to say

But sate long time in sencelesse sad affright
Looking still , if I might of her haue sight

For ruth of that same womans piteous paine
Whose wordes recording in my troubled braine

I felt such anguish wound my feeble heart
That frosen horror ran through euerie part

Being aboue my slender reasons reach
At length by demonstration me to teach

Before mine eies strange sights presented were
Like tragicke Pageants seeming to appeare

Might worship it , and fall on lowest staire
Not that great Idoll might with this compaire

To which th'Assyrian tyrant would haue made
The holie brethren , falslie to haue praid

With showres of heauen and tempests worne away
Then downe it fell , and low in ashes lay

Scorned of euerie one , which by it went
That I it seing , dearelie did lament

But placed on a plot of sandie ground
Not that great Towre , which is so much renownd

For tongues confusion in holie writ
King Ninus worke might be compar 'd to it

And giues the fruit of all your trauailes toyle
To be the pray of Tyme , and Fortunes spoyle

I saw this Towre fall sodainlie to dust
That nigh with griefe thereof my heart was brust

With pleasures choyce to feed his cheerefull sprights
Not that , which Merlin by his Magicke slights

Made for the gentle squire , to entertaine
His fayre BelphÃ¢â€°Ë†ÃƒÂ¬be , could this gardine staine

Since that I sawe this gardine wasted quite
That where it was scarce seemed anie sight

That I , which once that beautie did beholde
Could not from teares my melting eyes with-holde

Yet was he milde of speach , and meeke of nature
Not he , which in despight of his Creatour

With railing tearmes defied the Iewish hoast
Might with this mightie one in hugenes boast

But see the end of pompe and fleshlie pride
One of his feete vnwares from him did slide

That downe hee fell into the deepe Abisse
Where drownd with him is all his earthlie blisse

But like the coulored Rainbowe arched wide
Not that great Arche , which Traian edifide

To be a wonder to all age ensuing
Was matchable to this in equall vewing

This goodlie bridge , one foote not fastned well
Gan faile , and all the rest downe shortlie fell

Ne of so braue a building ought remained
That griefe thereof my spirite greatly pained

That saluage nature seemed not to haue
Nor after greedie spoyle of blood to craue

Two fairer beasts might not elswhere be found
Although the compast world were sought around

Was but earth , and with her owne weightinesse
Vpon them fell , and did vnwares oppresse

That for great sorrow of their sudden fate
Henceforth all worlds felicitie I hate

And I in minde remained sore agast
Distraught twixt feare and pitie ; when at last

I heard a voyce , which loudly to me called
That with the suddein shrill I was appalled

But hope of heauen , and heart to God inclinde
For all the rest must needs be left behinde

With that it bad me , to the other side
To cast mine eye , where other sights I spide

A fairer one in all the goodlie criew
Of white Strimonian brood might no man view

There he most sweetly sung the prophecie
Of his owne death in dolefull Elegie

With loftie flight aboue the earth he bounded
And out of sight to highest heauen mounted

Where now he is become an heauenly signe
There now the ioy is his , here sorrow mine

Swimming , that whilome seemed to haue been
The harpe , on which Dan Orpheus was seene

Wylde beasts and forrests after him to lead
But was th'Harpe of Philisides now dead

Of the strings , stirred with the warbling wind
That wrought both ioy and sorrow in my mind

So now in heauen a signe it doth appeare
The Harpe well knowne beside the Northern Beare

Exceeding all this baser worldes good
Yet through the ouerflowing of the flood

It almost drowned was , and done to nought
That sight thereof much grieu 'd my pensiue thought

And twixt their blessed armes it carried quight
Aboue the reach of anie liuing sight

So now it is transform 'd into that starre
In which all heauenly treasures locked are

And deckt with daintie flowres , as if it shold
Be for some bride , her ioyous night to hold

Therein a goodly Virgine sleeping lay
A fairer wight saw neuer summers day

To come to her , and seeke her loues delight
With that she started vp with cherefull sight

When suddeinly both bed and all was gone
And I in languor left there all alone

On which Dan Perseus borne of heauenly seed
The fair Andromeda from perill freed

Full mortally this Knight ywounded was
That streames of blood foorth flowed on the gras

Through braue atcheiuements from his enemies
Fainting at last through long infirmities

He smote his steed , that straight to heauen him bore
And left me here his losse for to deplore

Enclosde therein for endles memorie
Of him , whom all the world did glorifie

Seemed the heauens with the earth did disagree
Whether should of those ashes keeper bee

And to those ashes gaue a second life
To liue in heauen , where happines is rife

At which the earth did grieue exceedingly
And I for dole was almost like to die

Giue leaue to him that lou'de thee to lament
His losse , by lacke of thee to heauen hent

And with last duties of this broken verse
Broken with sighes , to decke thy sable Herse

With some few siluer dropping teares t'adorne
And as ye be of heauenlie off-spring borne

So vnto heauen let your high minde aspire
And loath this drosse of sinfull worlds desire

For trumpets sterne to chaunge mine Oaten reeds
And sing of Knights and Ladies gentle deeds

To blazon broad emongst her learned throng
Fierce warres and faithfull loues shall moralize my song

The antique rolles , which there lye hidden still
Of Faerie knights and fairest Tanaquill

That I must rue his vndeserued wrong
O helpe thou my weake wit , and sharpen my dull tong

That glorious fire it kindled in his hart
Lay now thy deadly Heben bow apart

In loues and gentle iollities arrayd
After his murdrous spoiles and bloudy rage allayd

Like PhÃ¢â€°Ë†ÃƒÂ¬bus lampe throughout the world doth shine
Shed thy faire beames into my feeble eyne

The argument of mine afflicted stile
The which to heare , vouchsafe , O dearest dred a-while

The cruell markes of many ' a bloudy fielde
Yet armes till that time did he neuer wield

Full iolly knight he seemd , and faire did sitt
As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt

And dead as liuing euer him adored
Vpon his shield the like was also scored

But of his cheere did seeme too solemne sad
Yet nothing did he dread , but euer was ydrad

To winne him worship , and her grace to haue
Which of all earthly things he most did craue

Vpon his foe , and his new force to learne
Vpon his foe , a Dragon horrible and stearne

Vnder a vele , that wimpled was full low
And ouer all a blacke stole she did throw

Seemed in heart some hidden care she had
And by her in a line a milke white lambe she lad

Of ancient Kings and Queenes , that had of yore
Their scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore

Forwasted all their land , and them expeld
Whom to auenge , she had this Knight from far compeld

Of needments at his backe . Thus as they past
The day with cloudes was suddeine ouercast

That euery wight to shrowd it did constrain
And this faire couple eke to shroud themselues were fain

Whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride
Did spred so broad , that heauens light did hide

With footing worne , and leading inward farre
Faire harbour that them seemes ; so in they entred arre

Seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky
Much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy

The builder Oake , sole king of forrests all
The Aspine good for staues , the Cypresse funerall

The Eugh obedient to the benders will
The Birch for shaftes , the Sallow for the mill

The fruitfull Oliue , and the Platane round
The caruer Holme , the Maple seeldom inward sound

They can not finde that path , which first was showne
But wander too and fro in wayes vnknowne

So many pathes , so many turnings seene
That which of them to take , in diuerse doubt they been

And like to lead the labyrinth about
Which when by tract they hunted had throughout

Eftsoones dismounted from his courser braue
And to the Dwarfe a while his needlesse spere he gaue

Breedes dreadfull doubts : Oft fire is without smoke
And perill without show : therefore your stroke

The forward footing for an hidden shade
Vertue giues her selfe light , through darkenesse for to wade

Yet wisedome warnes , whilest foot is in the gate
To stay the steppe , ere forced to retrate

Therefore I read beware . Fly fly ( quoth then
The fearefull Dwarfe : ) this is no place for liuing men

And looked in : his glistring armor made
A litle glooming light , much like a shade

But th'other halfe did womans shape retaine
Most lothsom , filthie , foule , and full of vile disdaine

Pointed with mortall sting . Of her there bred
A thousand yong ones , which she dayly fed

Soone as that vncouth light vpon them shone
Into her mouth they crept , and suddain all were gone

Were stretcht now forth at length without entraile
She lookt about , and seeing one in mayle

Ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine
Where plaine none might her see , nor she see any plaine

From turning backe , and forced her to stay
Therewith enrag 'd she loudly gan to bray

Who nought aghast , his mightie hand enhaunst
The stroke down from her head vnto her shoulder glaunst

With doubled forces high aboue the ground
Tho wrapping vp her wrethed sterne arownd

That hand or foot to stirre he stroue in vaine
God helpe the man so wrapt in Errours endlesse traine

Strangle her , else she sure will strangle thee
That when he heard , in great perplexitie

Wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine
That soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine

Which stunck so vildly , that it forst him slacke
His grasping hold , and from her turne him backe

And creeping sought way in the weedy gras
Her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has

And ouerflow each plaine and lowly dale
But when his later spring gins to auale

And partly female of his fruitfull seed
Such vgly monstrous shapes elswhere may no man reed

Whose corage when the feend perceiu 'd to shrinke
She poured forth out of her hellish sinke

Which swarming all about his legs did crall
And him encombred sore , but could not hurt at all

Markes which do byte their hasty supper best
A cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest

But with his clownish hands their tender wings
He brusheth oft , and oft doth mar their murmurings

Resolv 'd in minde all suddenly to win
Or soone to lose , before he once would lin

He raft her hatefull head without remorse
A streame of cole black bloud forth gushed from her corse

Gathred themselues about her body round
Weening their wonted entrance to haue found

And sucked vp their dying mothers blood
Making her death their life , and eke her hurt their good

Hauing all satisfide their bloudy thurst
Their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst

Now needeth him no lenger labour spend
His foes haue slaine themselues , with whom he should contend

Who see your vanquisht foes before you lye
Well worthy be you of that Armorie

Your first aduenture : many such I pray
And henceforth euer wish , that like succeed it may

Ne euer would to any by-way bend
But still did follow one vnto the end

He passed forth , and new aduenture sought
Long way he trauelled , before he heard of ought

And by his belt his booke he hanging had
Sober he seemde , and very sagely sad

And all the way he prayed , as he went
And often knockt his brest , as one that did repent

Of straunge aduentures , which abroad did pas
Ah my deare Sonne ( quoth he ) how should , alas

Tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell
With holy father sits not with such things to mell

That wasteth all this countrey farre and neare
Of such ( said he ) I chiefly do inquere

For to all knighthood it is foule disgrace
That such a cursed creature liues so long a space

Now ( sayd the Lady ) draweth toward night
And well I wote , that of your later fight

The Sunne that measures heauen all day long
At night doth baite his steedes the Ocean waues emong

Right well Sir knight ye haue aduised bin
( Quoth then that aged man ; ) the way to win

For this same night . The knight was well content
So with that godly father to his home they went

In trauell to and froe : a little wyde
There was an holy Chappell edifyde

Thereby a Christall streame did gently play
Which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway

The noblest mind the best contentment has
With faire discourse the euening so they pas

He told of Saintes and Popes , and euermore
He strowd an Aue-Mary after and before

Sweet slombring deaw , the which to sleepe them biddes
Vnto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes

His Magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes
He seekes out mighty charmes , to trouble sleepy mindes

He bad awake blacke Plutoes griesly Dame
And cursed heauen , and spake reprochfull shame

Great Gorgon , Prince of darknesse and dead night
At which Cocytus quakes , and Styx is put to flight

A-waite whereto their seruice he applyes
To aide his friends , or fray his enimies

The one of them he gaue a message too
The other by him selfe staide other worke to doo

Amid the bowels of the earth full steepe
And low , where dawning day doth neuer peepe

In siluer deaw his euer-drouping hed
Whiles sad Night ouer him her mantle black doth spred

And wakefull dogges before them farre do lye
Watching to banish Care their enimy

And vnto Morpheus comes , whom drowned deepe
In drowsie fit he findes : of nothing he takes keepe

Mixt with a murmuring winde , much like the sowne
Of swarming Bees , did cast him in a swowne

Might there be heard : but carelesse Quiet lyes
Wrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes

Then rudely he him thrust , and pusht with paine
Whereat he gan to stretch : but he againe

Is tost with troubled sights and fancies weake
He mumbled soft , but would not all his silence breake

And lifting vp his lumpish head , with blame
Halfe angry asked him , for what he came

He bids thee to him send for his intent
A fit false dreame , that can delude the sleepers sent

His heauie head , deuoide of carefull carke
Whose sences all were straight benumbd and starke

And on his litle winges the dreame he bore
In hast vnto his Lord , where he him left afore

So liuely , and so like in all mens sight
That weaker sence it could haue rauisht quight

Her all in white he clad , and ouer it
Cast a blacke stole , most like to seeme for Vna fit

And with false shewes abuse his fantasy
In sort as he him schooled priuily

He taught to imitate that Lady trew
Whose semblance she did carrie vnder feigned hew

And made him dreame of loues and lustfull play
That nigh his manly hart did melt away

And to him playnd , how that false winged boy
Her chast hart had subdewd , to learne Dame pleasures toy

To be the chastest flowre , that ay did spring
On earthly braunch , the daughter of a king

Hymen to Hymen , dauncing all around
Whilst freshest Flora her with Yuie girlond crownd

Some secret ill , or hidden foe of his
Lo there before his face his Lady is

With gentle blandishment and louely looke
Most like that virgin true , which for her knight him took

But hasty heat tempring with sufferance wise
He stayde his hand , and gan himselfe aduise

Tho can she weepe , to stirre vp gentle ruth
Both for her noble bloud , and for her tender youth

Or the blind God , that doth me thus amate
For hoped loue to winne me certaine hate

You , whom my hard auenging destinie
Hath made iudge of my life or death indifferently

And then againe begun , My weaker yeares
Captiu 'd to fortune and frayle worldly feares

Why Dame ( quoth he ) what hath ye thus dismayd
What frayes ye , that were wont to comfort me affrayd

Whiles you in carelesse sleepe are drowned quight
Her doubtfull words made that redoubted knight

He would not shend , but said , Deare dame I rew
That for my sake vnknowne such griefe vnto you grew

Ne let vaine feares procure your needlesse smart
Where cause is none , but to your rest depart

And fed with words , that could not chuse but please
So slyding softly forth , she turnd as to her ease

At last dull wearinesse of former fight
Hauing yrockt a sleepe his irkesome spright

But when he saw his labour all was vaine
With that misformed spright he backe returnd againe

But firme is fixt , and sendeth light from farre
To all , that in the wide deepe wandring arre

In hast was climbing vp the Easterne hill
Full enuious that night so long his roome did fill

Their bootelesse paines , and ill succeeding night
Who all in rage to see his skilfull might

But when he saw his threatning was but vaine
He cast about , and searcht his balefull bookes againe

Like a young Squire , in loues and lusty-hed
His wanton dayes that euer loosely led

Couered with darknesse and misdeeming night
Them both together laid , to ioy in vaine delight

Whom suddenly he wakes with fearefull frights
As one aghast with feends or damned sprights

Haue knit themselues in Venus shamefull chaine
Come see , where your false Lady doth her honour staine

Where that false couple were full closely ment
In wanton lust and lewd embracement

And would haue slaine them in his furious ire
But hardly was restreined of that aged sire

And wast his inward gall with deepe despight
Yrkesome of life , and too long lingring night

Then vp he rose , and clad him hastily
The Dwarfe him brought his steed : so both away do fly

And the high hils Titan discouered
The royall virgin shooke off drowsy-hed

And for her Dwarfe , that wont to wait each houre
Then gan she waile and weepe , to see that woefull stowre

Pricked with wrath and fiery fierce disdaine
That him to follow was but fruitlesse paine

Did search , sore grieued in her gentle brest
He so vngently left her , whom she loued best

Th'end of his drift , he praisd his diuelish arts
That had such might ouer true meaning harts

For her he hated as the hissing snake
And in her many troubles did most pleasure take

As euer Proteus to himselfe could make
Sometime a fowle , sometime a fish in lake

And oft would flie away . O who can tell
The hidden power of herbes , and might of Magicke spell

And siluer shield vpon his coward brest
A bloudy crosse , and on his crauen crest

And when he sate vpon his courser free
Saint George himself ye would haue deemed him to be

Will was his guide , and griefe led him astray
At last him chaunst to meete vpon the way

Sans foy : full large of limbe and euery ioint
He was , and cared not for God or man a point

And like a Persian mitre on her hed
She wore , with crownes and owches garnished

With tinsell trappings , wouen like a waue
Whose bridle rung with golden bels and bosses braue

She soone left off her mirth and wanton play
And bad her knight addresse him to the fray

Forth spurred fast : adowne his coursers side
The red bloud trickling staind the way , as he did ride

Soone meete they both , both fell and furious
That daunted with their forces hideous

Astonied with the stroke of their owne hand
Do backe rebut , and each to other yeeldeth land

Do meete , that with the terrour of the shocke
Astonied both , stand sencelesse as a blocke

Both staring fierce , and holding idely
The broken reliques of their former cruelty

Each others equall puissaunce enuies
And through their iron sides with cruell spies

As from a forge out of their burning shields
And streames of purple bloud new dies the verdant fields

Had not that charme from thee forwarned it
But yet I warne thee now assured sitt

That a large share it hewd out of the rest
And glauncing downe his shield , from blame him fairely blest

So hugely stroke , that it the steele did riue
And cleft his head . He tumbling downe aliue

With the fraile flesh ; at last it flitted is
Whither the soules do fly of men , that liue amis

But from him fled away with all her powre
Who after her as hastily gan scowre

Her soone he ouertooke , and bad to stay
For present cause was none of dread her to dismay

And to your mighty will . Her humblesse low
In so ritch weedes and seeming glorious show

Much rueth me ; but now put feare apart
And tell , both who ye be , and who that tooke your part

Before that angry heauens list to lowre
And fortune false betraide me to your powre

He that the wide West vnder his rule has
And high hath set his throne , where Tiberis doth pas

Was neuer Prince so faithfull and so faire
Was neuer Prince so meeke and debonaire

Into the hands of his accursed fone
And cruelly was slaine , that shall I euer mone

When tidings came to me vnhappy maid
O how great sorrow my sad soule assaid

A virgin widow , whose deepe wounded mind
With loue , long time did languish as the striken hind

The Fort , that Ladies hold in soueraigne dread
There lies he now with foule dishonour dead

Of one bad sire , whose youngest is Sans ioy
And twixt them both was borne the bloudy bold Sans loy

To do none ill , if please ye not do well
He in great passion all this while did dwell

And said , Faire Lady hart of flint would rew
The vndeserued woes and sorrowes , which ye shew

Better new friend then an old foe is said
With chaunge of cheare the seeming simple maid

So forth they rode , he feining seemely merth
And she coy lookes : so dainty they say maketh derth

Their armes abroad , with gray mosse ouercast
And their greene leaues trembling with euery blast

Vnder them neuer sat , ne wont there sound
His mery oaten pipe , but shund th'vnlucky ground

From fiery wheeles of his faire chariot
Hurled his beame so scorching cruell hot

There they alight , in hope themselues to hide
From the fierce heat , and rest their weary limbs a tide

To be the fairest wight , that liued yit
Which to expresse , he bends his gentle wit

He pluckt a bough ; out of whose rift there came
Small drops of gory bloud , that trickled downe the same

But fly , ah fly far hence away , for feare
Least to you hap , that happened to me heare

Astond he stood , and vp his haire did houe
And with that suddein horror could no member moue

And doubting much his sence , he thus bespake
What voyce of damned Ghost from Limbo lake

Sends to my doubtfull eares these speaches rare
And ruefull plaints , me bidding guiltlesse bloud to spare

Wretched man , wretched tree ; whose nature weake
A cruell witch her cursed will to wreake

And scorching Sunne does dry my secret vaines
For though a tree I seeme , yet cold and heat me paines

He oft finds med'cine , who his griefe imparts
But double griefs afflict concealing harts

Is one Duessa a false sorceresse
That many errÃƒÂ£t knights hath brought to wretchednesse

To loue this gentle Lady , whom ye see
Now not a Lady , but a seeming tree

That had a like faire Lady by his syde
Like a faire Lady , but did fowle Duessa hyde

Mine , that did then shine as the Morning starre
So both to battell fierce arraunged arre

His Lady left as a prise martiall
Did yield her comely person , to be at my call

Whether in beauties glorie did exceede
A Rosy girlond was the victors meede

FrÃƒÂ¦lissa was as faire , as faire mote bee
And euer false Duessa seemde as faire as shee

And by her hellish science raisd streightway
A foggy mist , that ouercast the day

And with foule vgly forme did her disgrace
Then was she faire alone , when none was faire in place

O leaue her soone , or let her soone be slaine
Her loathly visage viewing with disdaine

The false witch did my wrathfull hand with-hold
So left her , where she now is turnd to treen mould

Till on a day ( that day is euery Prime
When Witches wont do penance for their crime

A filthy foule old woman I did vew
That euer to haue toucht her , I did deadly rew

Then womans shape man would beleeue to bee
Thensforth from her most beastly companie

For danger great , if not assur 'd decay
I saw before mine eyes , if I were knowne to stray

My bodie all , through charmes and magicke might
That all my senses were bereaued quight

Where now enclosd in wooden wals full faste
Banisht from liuing wights , our wearie dayes we waste

Till we be bathed in a liuing well
That is the terme prescribed by the spell

Time and suffised fates to former kynd
Shall vs restore , none else from hence may vs vnbynd

Full of sad feare and ghastly dreriment
When all this speech the liuing tree had spent

And with fresh clay did close the wooden wound
Then turning to his Lady , dead with feare her found

Her out of carelesse swowne . Her eylids blew
And dimmed sight with pale and deadly hew

And oft her kist . At length all passed feare
He set her on her steede , and forward forth did beare

Through enuies snares or fortunes freakes vnkind
I , whether lately through her brightnesse blind

Feele my heart perst with so great agonie
When such I see , that all for pittie I could die

To thinke how she through guilefull handeling
Though true as touch , though daughter of a king

Is from her knight diuorced in despaire
And her due loues deriu 'd to that vile witches share

In wildernesse and wastfull deserts strayd
To seeke her knight ; who subtilly betrayd

Through woods and wastnesse wide him daily sought
Yet wished tydings none of him vnto her brought

In secret shadow , farre from all mens sight
From her faire head her fillet she vndight

And made a sunshine in the shadie place
Did neuer mortall eye behold such heauenly grace

Soone as the royall virgin he did spy
With gaping mouth at her ran greedily

His bloudie rage asswaged with remorse
And with the sight amazd , forgat his furious forse

O how can beautie maister the most strong
And simple truth subdue auenging wrong

Her hart gan melt in great compassion
And drizling teares did shed for pure affection

Forgetfull of the hungry rage , which late
Him prickt , in pittie of my sad estate

Her that him lou 'd , and euer most adord
As the God of my life ? why hath he me abhord

The kingly beast vpon her gazing stood
With pittie calmd , downe fell his angry mood

And to her snowy Palfrey got againe
To seeke her strayed Champion , if she might attaine

Of her sad troubles and misfortunes hard
Still when she slept , he kept both watch and ward

From her faire eyes he tooke commaundement
And euer by her lookes conceiued her intent

Till that at length she found the troden gras
In which the tract of peoples footing was

A damzell spyde slow footing her before
That on her shoulders sad a pot of water bore

She could not heare , nor speake , nor vnderstand
Till seeing by her side the Lyon stand

Face of faire Ladie she before did vew
And that dread Lyons looke her cast in deadly hew

Sate in eternall night : nought could she say
But suddaine catching hold , did her dismay

Gan shut the dore . By this arriued there
Dame Vna , wearie Dame , and entrance did requere

Nigh dead with feare , and faint astonishment
She found them both in darkesome corner pent

Nine hundred Pater nosters euery day
And thrise nine hundred Aues she was wont to say

And thrise three times did fast from any bit
But now for feare her beads she did forget

Which hardly doen , at length she gan them pray
That in their cotage small , that night she rest her may

And at her feet the Lyon watch doth keepe
In stead of rest , she does lament , and weepe

Her tender brest in bitter teares all night
All night she thinks too long , and often lookes for light

One knocked at the dore , and in would fare
He knocked fast , and often curst , and sware

Of nightly stelths and pillage seuerall
Which he had got abroad by purchase criminall

Which giuen was to them for good intents
The holy Saints of their rich vestiments

Whiles none the holy things in safety kept
Then he by cunning sleights in at the window crept

Abessa daughter of Corceca slow
With whom he whoredome vsd , that few did know

Ne spared he to giue her gold and rings
And now he to her brought part of his stolen things

He would no longer stay him to aduize
But open breakes the dore in furious wize

And seizing cruell clawes on trembling brest
Vnder his Lordly foot him proudly hath supprest

And quite dismembred hath : the thirstie land
Drunke vp his life ; his corse left on the strand

The heauie hap , which on them is alight
Affraid , least to themselues the like mishappen might

In wayes vnknowne , her wandring knight to seeke
With paines farre passing that long wandring Greeke

Still seeking him , that from her still did flie
Then furthest from her hope , when most she weened nie

For anguish great they gan to rend their heare
And beat their brests , and naked flesh to teare

Halfe mad through malice , and reuenging will
To follow her , that was the causer of their ill

And her accusing of dishonesty
That was the flowre of faith and chastity

Might fall on her , and follow all the way
And that in endlesse error she might euer stray

A knight her met in mighty armes embost
Yet knight was not for all his bragging bost

Of that old woman tydings he besought
If that of such a Ladie she could tellen ought

That causd her shed so many a bitter teare
And so forth told the story of her feare

Which being taught , he forward gan aduaunce
His fair enchaunted steed , and eke his charmed launce

Himselfe too nigh at hand , but turned wyde
Vnto an hill ; from whence when she him spyde

Approching nigh , she wist it was the same
And with faire fearefull humblesse towards him shee came

Or ought haue done , that ye displeasen might
That should as death vnto my deare hart light

And eke my night of death the shadow is
But welcome now my light , and shining lampe of blis

As you to leaue , that haue me loued still
And chose in Faery court of meere goodwill

To bring forth fruit , and make eternall derth
Then I leaue you , my liefe , yborne of heauenly berth

To many knights did daily worke disgrace
But knight he now shall neuer more deface

My faithfull seruice , that by land and seas
Haue vowd you to defend . Now then your plaint appease

A dram of sweet is worth a pound of sowre
She has forgot , how many a wofull stowre

To looken backe ; his eyes be fixt before
Before her stands her knight , for whom she toyld so sore

And long time hauing tand his tawney hide
With blustring breath of heauen , that none can bide

His chearefull whistle merrily doth sound
And Nereus crownes with cups ; his mates him pledg around

His ship farre come from watrie wildernesse
He hurles out vowes , and Neptune oft doth blesse

In which he askt her , what the Lyon ment
Who told her all that fell in iourney as she went

That through his fiercenesse fomed all with sweat
And the sharpe yron did for anger eat

Cruell reuenge , which he in hart did hyde
And on his shield Sans loy in bloudie lines was dyde

Himselfe to battell with his couched speare
Loth was that other , and did faint through feare

That hope of new good hap he gan to feele
So bent his speare , and spurnd his horse with yron heele

And had his staggering steede not shrunke for feare
Through shield and bodie eke he should him beare

He tombling rudely downe to ground did rush
And from his gored wound a well of bloud did gush

Of him , that slew Sansfoy with bloudie knife
Henceforth his ghost freed from repining strife

The blacke infernall Furies doen aslake
Life from Sansfoy thou tookst , Sansloy shall frÃƒÂµ thee take

Enough is , that thy foe doth vanquisht stand
Now at thy mercy : Mercie not withstand

And whilest him fortune fauourd , faire did thriue
In bloudie field : therefore of life him not depriue

And hoarie head of Archimago old
His hastie hand he doth amazed hold

In charmes and magicke to haue wondrous might
Ne euer wont in field , ne in round lists to fight

Or thine the fault , or mine the error is
In stead of foe to wound my friend amis

The cloud of death did sit . Which doen away
He left him lying so , ne would no lenger stay

For so misfeigning her true knight to bee
Yet is she now in more perplexitie

Who by her cleanly garment catching hold
Her from her Palfrey pluckt , her visage to behold

With gaping iawes full greedy at him came
And ramping on his shield , did weene the same

His corage more , that frÃƒÂµ his griping pawes
He hath his shield redeem 'd , and foorth his sword he drawes

As euer wielded speare in warlike hand
And feates of armes did wisely vnderstand

And launcht his Lordly hart : with death opprest
He roar 'd aloud , whiles life forsooke his stubborne brest

Her selfe a yeelded pray to saue or spill
He now Lord of the field , his pride to fill

Beares her away vpon his courser light
Her prayers nought preuaile , his rage is more of might

And all the way she wets with flowing teares
But he enrag 'd with rancor , nothing heares

To be partaker of her wandring woe
More mild in beastly kind , then that her beastly foe

In choice , and change of thy deare loued Dame
Least thou of her beleeue too lightly blame

Then lightnesse and inconstancie in loue
That doth this Redcrosse knights ensample plainly proue

Called Fidess ' , and so supposd to bee
Long with her traueild , till at last they see

And towards it a broad high way that led
All bare through peoples feet , which thither traueiled

With balefull beggerie , or foule disgrace
Which euer after in most wretched case

For she is wearie of the toilesome way
And also nigh consumed is the lingring day

And golden foile all ouer them displaid
That purest skye with brightnesse they dismaid

Full of faire windowes , and delightfull bowres
And on the top a Diall told the timely howres

Did on so weake foundation euer sit
For on a sandie hill , that still did flit

And all the hinder parts , that few could spie
Were ruinous and old , but painted cunningly

Cald MaluenÃƒÂº , who entrance none denide
Thence to the hall , which was on euery side

There waiting long , to win the wished sight
Of her , that was the Lady of that Pallace bright

In liuing Princes court none euer knew
Such endlesse richesse , and so sumptuous shew

Of Lordes and Ladies stood on euery side
Which with their presence faire , the place much beautifide

With royall robes and gorgeous array
A mayden Queene , that shone as Titans ray

To dim the brightnesse of her glorious throne
As enuying her selfe , that too exceeding shone

Through highest heauen with weaker hand to rayne
Proud of such glory and aduancement vaine

And rapt with whirling wheeles , inflames the skyen
With fire not made to burne , but fairely for to shyne

Lo vnderneath her scornefull feete , was layne
A dreadfull Dragon with an hideous trayne

And in her selfe-lou 'd semblance tooke delight
For she was wondrous faire , as any liuing wight

That parentage , with pride so did she swell
And thundring Ioue , that high in heauen doth dwell

For to the highest she did still aspyre
Or if ought higher were then that , did it desyre

Ne heritage of natiue soueraintie
But did vsurpe with wrong and tyrannie

And strong aduizement of six wisards old
That with their counsels bad her kingdome did vphold

Made rowme , and passage for them did prepaire
So goodly brought them to the lowest staire

Why they were come , her royall state to see
To proue the wide report of her great Maiestee

Of Princesse worthy , scarse them bad arise
Her Lordes and Ladies all this while deuise

Some prancke their ruffes , and others trimly dight
Their gay attire : each others greater pride does spight

All kindnesse and faire courtesie to shew
For in that court whylome her well they knew

And that great Princesse too exceeding prowd
That to strange knight no better countenance allowd

As faire Aurora in her purple pall
Out of the East the dawning day doth call

Do ride each other , vpon her to gaze
Her glorious glitterand light doth all mens eyes amaze

And stroue to match , in royall rich array
Great Iunoes golden chaire , the which they say

Drawne of faire Pecocks , that excell in pride
And full of Argus eyes their tailes dispredden wide

With like conditions to their kinds applyde
Of which the first , that all the rest did guyde

Arayd in habit blacke , and amis thin
Like to an holy Monck , the seruice to begin

Still drownd in sleepe , and most of his dayes ded
Scarse could he once vphold his heauie hed

When such an one had guiding of the way
That knew not , whether right he went , or else astray

For contemplation sake : yet otherwise
His life he led in lawlesse riotise

A shaking feuer raignd continually
Such one was Idlenesse , first of this company

And eke with fatnesse swollen were his eyne
And like a Crane his necke was long and fyne

And all the way , most like a brutish beast
He spued vp his gorge , that all did him deteast

From vnder which fast trickled downe the sweat
Still as he rode , he somewhat still did eat

His dronken corse he scarse vpholden can
In shape and life more like a monster , then a man

Whose mind in meat and drinke was drowned so
That from his friend he seldome knew his fo

Which by misdiet daily greater grew
Such one was Gluttony , the second of that crew

Was like the person selfe , whom he did beare
Who rough , and blacke , and filthy did appeare

When fairer faces were bid standen by
O who does know the bent of womens fantasy

Full of vaine follies , and new fanglenesse
For he was false , and fraught with ficklenesse

And fortunes tell , and read in louing bookes
And thousand other wayes , to bait his fleshly hookes

But ioyd weake wemens hearts to tempt , and proue
If from their loyall loues he might then moue

That rots the marrow , and consumes the braine
Such one was Lecherie , the third of all this traine

With precious mettall full , as they might hold
And in his lap an heape of coine he told

Accursed vsurie was all his trade
And right and wrong ylike in equall ballaunce waide

But both from backe and belly still did spare
To fill his bags , and richesse to compare

To get , and nightly feare to lose his owne
He led a wretched life vnto him selfe vnknowne

Whose wealth was want , whose plÃ¡ÂºÂ½ty made him pore
Who had enough , yet wished euer more

That well he could not touch , nor go , nor stand
Such one was Auarice , the fourth of this faire band

That all the poison ran about his chaw
But inwardly he chawed his owne maw

And wept , that cause of weeping none he had
But when he heard of harme , he wexed wondrous glad

An hatefull Snake , the which his taile vptyes
In many folds , and mortall sting implyes

And grudged at the great felicitie
Of proud Lucifera , and his owne companie

His almes for want of faith he doth accuse
So euery good to bad he doth abuse

From leprous mouth on all , that euer writt
Such one vile Enuie was , that fift in row did sitt

The which he brandisheth about his hed
His eyes did hurle forth sparkles fiery red

And on his dagger still his hand he held
Trembling through hasty rage , whÃ¡ÂºÂ½ choler in him sweld

For of his hands he had no gouernement
Ne car 'd for bloud in his auengement

Yet wilfull man he neuer would forecast
How many mischieues should ensue his heedlesse hast

Bitter despight , with rancours rusty knife
And fretting griefe the enemy of life

The shaking Palsey , and Saint Fraunces fire
Such one was VVrath , the last of this vngodly tire

So oft as Slowth still in the mire did stand
Huge routs of people did about them band

And vnderneath their feet , all scattered lay
Dead sculs & bones of men , whose life had gone astray

Emongst the rest rode that false Lady faire
The fowle Duessa , next vnto the chaire

Him selfe estraunging from their ioyaunce vaine
Whose fellowship seemd far vnfit for warlike swaine

Whereas an errant knight in armes ycled
And heathnish shield , wherein with letters red

He seemd in hart to harbour thoughts vnkind
And nourish bloudy vengeaunce in his bitter mind

His eldest brother , burning all with rage
He to him leapt , and that same enuious gage

Disdaind to loose the meed he wonne in fray
And him rencountring fierce , reskewd the noble pray

That with their sturre they troubled all the traine
Till that great Queene vpon eternall paine

And if that either to that shield had right
In equall lists they should the morrow next it fight

Of reasons rule , to see this recreant knight
No knight , but treachour full of false despight

Euen stout Sans foy ( O who can then refrayn
Whose shield he beares renuerst , the more to heape disdayn

Who reapes the haruest sowen by his foe
Sowen in bloudy field , and bought with woe

Him litle answerd th'angry Elfin knight
He neuer meant with words , but swords to plead his right

To be aueng 'd each on his enimy
That night they pas in ioy and iollity

That of his plenty poured forth to all
Which doen , the Chamberlain Slowth did to rest them call

Did chace away sweet sleepe from sluggish eye
To muse on meanes of hoped victory

Vp-rose Duessa from her resting place
And to the Paynims lodging comes with silent pace

Ah deare Sans ioy , next dearest to Sans foy
Cause of my new griefe , cause of my new ioy

That was the flowre of grace and cheualrye
Lo his Fidessa to thy secret faith I flye

Oft tempred is ( quoth she ) with muchell smart
For since my brest was launcht with louely dart

Haue wasted , louing him with all my powre
And for his sake haue felt full many an heauie stowre

By this false faytor , who vnworthy ware
His worthy shield , whom he with guilefull snare

And euer since hath kept in darksome caue
For that I would not yeeld , that to Sans-foy I gaue

From dreaded storme of his disdainfull spight
To you th'inheritance belongs by right

Be vnreueng 'd , that calles to you aboue
From wandring Stygian shores , where it doth endlesse moue

For needlesse feare did neuer vantage none
And helplesse hap it booteth not to mone

He liues , that shall him pay his dewties last
And guiltie Elfin bloud shall sacrifice in hast

Where both do fight alike , to win or yield
Yea but ( quoth she ) he beares a charmed shield

Charmd or enchaunted ( answerd he then ferce
I no whit reck , ne you the like need to reherce

Till morrow next , that I the Elfe subdew
And with Sans-foyes dead dowry you endew

Where euer yet I be , my secrete aid
Shall follow you . So passing forth she him obaid

Th'eternall brood of glorie excellent
Such restlesse passion did all night torment

Came dauncing forth , shaking his deawie haire
And hurld his glistring beames through gloomy aire

In sun-bright armes , and battailous array
For with that Pagan proud he combat will that day

There many Minstrales maken melody
To driue away the dull melancholy

And many Chroniclers , that can record
Old loues , and warres for Ladies doen by many a Lord

Does care for looke of liuing creatures eye
They bring them wines of Greece and Araby

And in the wine a solemne oth they bynd
T'obserue the sacred lawes of armes , that are assynd

And placed vnder stately canapee
The warlike feates of both those knights to see

Sans-foy his shield is hangd with bloudy hew
Both those the lawrell girlonds to the victor dew

And burning blades about their heads do blesse
The instruments of wrath and heauinesse

Deepe dinted furrowes in the battred mayle
The yron walles to ward their blowes are weake & fraile

The knight was fiers , and full of youthly heat
And doubled strokes , like dreaded thunders threat

That from their shields forth flyeth firie light
And helmets hewen deepe , shew marks of eithers might

Through widest ayre making his ydle way
That would his rightfull rauine rend away

The wise Southsayer seeing so sad sight
Th'amazed vulgar tels of warres and mortall fight

In tender flesh , that streames of bloud down flow
With which the armes , that earst so bright did show

Seeing the gored woundes to gape so wyde
That victory they dare not wish to either side

Therewith redoubled was his raging yre
And said , Ah wretched sonne of wofull syre

And sluggish german doest thy forces slake
To after-send his foe , that him may ouertake

That I his shield haue quit from dying foe
Therewith vpon his crest he stroke him so

The lookers on , and lowd to him gan call
The false Duessa , Thine the shield , and I , and all

The creeping deadly cold away did shake
Tho mou 'd with wrath , and shame , and Ladies sake

That forced him to stoupe vpon his knee
Had he not stouped so , he should haue clouen bee

Goe say , his foe thy shield with his doth beare
Therewith his heauie hand he high gan reare

But vanisht is . The Elfe him cals alowd
But answer none receiues : the darknes him does shrowd

Let now abate the terror of your might
And quench the flame of furious despight

Haue borne him hence to Plutoes balefull bowres
The conquest yours , I yours , the shield , and glory yours

Who all that while lay hid in secret shade
He standes amazed , how he thence should fade

Greeting him goodly with new victorie
And to him brought the shield , the cause of enmitie

Which she accepts , with thankes , and goodly gree
Greatly aduauncing his gay cheualree

Shouting , and clapping all their hands on hight
That all the aire it fils , and flyes to heauen bright

In wine and oyle they wash his woundes wide
And softly can embalme on euery side

Him to beguile of griefe and agony
And all the while Duessa wept full bitterly

Doth meet a cruell craftie Crocodile
Which in false griefe hyding his harmefull guile

His mournefull plight , is swallowd vp vnwares
Forgetfull of his owne , that mindes anothers cares

But comes vnto the place , where th'Hethen knight
In slombring swownd nigh voyd of vitall spright

To wayle his woefull case she would not stay
But to the easterne coast of heauen makes speedy way

She findes forth comming from her darkesome mew
Where she all day did hide her hated hew

And coleblacke steedes yborne of hellish brood
That on their rustie bits did champ , as they were wood

And th'vnacquainted light began to feare
For neuer did such brightnesse there appeare

Saying , Yet ÃƒÂ´ thou dreaded Dame , I craue
Abide , till I haue told the message , which I haue

Or that great house of Gods cÃƒÂ¦lestiall
Which wast begot in DÃƒÂ¦mogorgons hall

With Elfin sword , most shamefully betrade
Lo where the stout Sansioy doth sleepe in deadly shade

Nor wayld of friends , nor laid on groning beare
That whylome was to me too dearely deare

Or who shall not great Nightes children scorne
When two of three her Nephews are so fowle forlorne

That dreaded Night in brightest day hath place
And can the children of faire light deface

Yet pittie in her hart was neuer proued
Till then : for euermore she hated , neuer loued

But who can turne the streame of destinee
Or breake the chayne of strong necessitee

And by my ruines thinkes to make them great
To make one great by others losse , is bad excheat

Shall with his owne bloud price that he hath spilt
But what art thou , that telst of Nephews kilt

And gorgeous gold arayd I to thee came
Duessa I , the daughter of Deceipt and Shame

Did closely lurke ; yet so true-seeming grace
It carried , that I scarse in darkesome place

O welcome child , whom I haue longd to see
And how haue seene vnwares . Lo now I go with thee

Her twyfold Teme , of which two blacke as pitch
And two were browne , yet each to each vnlich

Then foming tarre , their bridles they would champe
And trampling the fine element , would fiercely rampe

Couerd with charmed cloud from vew of day
And sight of men , since his late luckelesse fray

And handle softly , till they can be healed
So lay him in her charet , close in night concealed

With which her yron wheeles did them affray
And her darke griesly looke them much dismay

And hungry Wolues continually did howle
At her abhorred face , so filthy and so fowle

By that same hole an entrance darke and bace
With smoake and sulphure hiding all the place

But dreadfull Furies , which their chaines haue brast
And damned sprights sent forth to make ill men aghast

Which passing through , on euery side them stood
The trembling ghosts with sad amazed mood

Of feends infernall flockt on euery side
To gaze on earthly wight , that with the Night durst ride

Whereas the damned ghosts in torments fry
And with sharpe shrilling shriekes doe bootlesse cry

In which ten thousand sorts of punishment
The cursed creatures doe eternally torment

And lilled forth his bloudie flaming tong
At them he gan to reare his bristles strong

And suffered them to passen quietly
For she in hell and heauen had power equally

Against an hill , ne might from labour lin
There thirstie Tantalus hong by the chin

Theseus condemned to endlesse slouth by law
And fifty sisters water in leake vessels draw

Till they be come vnto the furthest part
Where was a Caue ywrought by wondrous art

Emprisond was in chaines remedilesse
For that Hippolytus rent corse he did redresse

But Ladies loue as losse of time forbore
His wanton stepdame loued him the more

His father fierce of treason false accused
And with her gealous termes his open eares abused

With dread whereof his chasing steedes aghast
Both charet swift and huntsman ouercast

Scattered on euery mountaine , as he went
That of Hippolytus was left no moniment

Which hearing his rash Syre , began to rend
His haire , and hastie tongue , that did offend

Them brought to Ãƒâ€ sculape , that by his art
Did heale them all againe , and ioyned euery part

Of endlesse life he might him not depriue
But vnto hell did thrust him downe aliue

Himselfe wilth salues to health for to restore
And slake the heauenly fire , that raged euermore

Whom hauing softly disarayd of armes
Tho gan to him discouer all his harmes

A fordonne wight from dore of death mote raise
He would at her request prolong her nephews daies

With like attempt to like end to renew
Is not enough , that thrust from heauen dew

Thou biddest me to eeke ? Can Night defray
The wrath of thundring Ioue , that rules both night and day

And fearest not , that more thee hurten might
Now in the powre of euerlasting Night

In medicine , that else hath to thee wonne
Great paines , & greater praise , both neuer to be donne

Which hauing seene , from thence arose away
The mother of dread darknesse , and let stay

To runne her timely race , whilst Phoebus pure
In westerne waues his wearie wagon did recure

Departed thence , albe his woundes wide
Not throughly heald , vnreadie were to ride

Where in a dongeon deepe huge numbers lay
Of caytiue wretched thrals , that wayled night and day

How mortgaging their liues to Couetise
Through wastfull Pride , and wanton Riotise

Condemned to that Dongeon mercilesse
Where they should liue in woe , & die in wretchednesse

Till through celestiall doome throwne out of dore
Into an Oxe he was transform 'd of yore

And proud Antiochus , the which aduaunst
His cursed hand gainst God , and on his altars daunst

In princely pompe , of all the world obayd
There also was that mightie Monarch layd

And would as Ammons sonne be magnifide
Till scornd of God and man a shamefull death he dide

The antique ruines of the Romaines fall
Great Romulus the Grandsyre of them all

Ambitious Sylla , and sterne Marius
High CÃƒÂ¦sar , great Pompey , and fierce Antonius

With sonnes owne blade , her fowle reproches spoke
Faire Sthenoboea , that her selfe did choke

Of Aspes sting her selfe did stoutly kill
And thousands moe the like , that did that dongeon fill

Through wicked pride , and wasted wealthes decay
But most of all , which in the Dongeon lay

Consumed had their goods , and thriftlesse howres
And lastly throwne themselues into these heauy stowres

There dwell in perill of like painefull plight
But early rose , and ere that dawning light

That of no enuious eyes he mote be spyde
For doubtlesse death ensewd , if any him descryde

Without remorse , or decent funerall
Which all through that great Princesse pride did fall

A donghill of dead carkases he spide
The dreadfull spectacle of that sad house of Pride

The Marriner yet halfe amazed stares
At perill past , and yet in doubt ne dares

The dreadlesse courage of this Elfin knight
Hauing escapt so sad ensamples in his sight

Her truth had staind with treason so vnkind
Yet crime in her could neuer creature find

Him for to seeke , ne euer would forsake
Till her vnwares the fierce Sansloy did ouertake

With beastly sin thought her to haue defilde
And made the vassall of his pleasures vilde

For greater conquest of hard loue he gaynes
That workes it to his will , then he that it constraines

But wordes , and lookes , and sighes she did abhore
As rocke of Diamond stedfast euermore

Then gan her beautie shine , as brightest skye
And burnt his beastly hart t'efforce her chastitye

Whereof he weend possessed soone to bee
And win rich spoile of ransackt chastetee

How can ye vengeance iust so long withhold
And hurle not flashing flames vpon that Paynim bold

And with loud plaints importuneth the skyes
That molten starres do drop like weeping eyes

And hides for shame . What wit of mortall wight
Can now deuise to quit a thrall from such a plight

From Lyons clawes to pluck the griped pray
Her shrill outcryes and shriekes so loud did bray

Within the wood were dauncing in a rownd
Whiles old Syluanus slept in shady arber sownd

To weet , what wight so loudly did lament
Vnto the place they come incontinent

Whose like he neuer saw , he durst not bide
But got his ready steed , and fast away gan ride

As her outrageous foe had left her late
And trembling yet through feare of former hate

All stand astonied at her beautie bright
In their rude eyes vnworthie of so wofull plight

A seely Lambe farre from the flocke does take
Of whom he meanes his bloudie feast to make

Which quit from death yet quakes in euery lim
With chaunge of feare , to see the Lyon looke so grim

And read her sorrow in her count'nance sad
Their frowning forheads with rough hornes yclad

To comfort her , and feare to put away
Their backward bent knees teach her humbly to obay

Late learnd what harme to hastie trust ensu'th
They in compassion of her tender youth

And all prostrate vpon the lowly plaine
Do kisse her feete , and fawne on her with count'nance faine

And walketh forth without suspect of crime
They all as glad , as birdes of ioyous Prime

And with greene braunches strowing all the ground
Do worship her , as Queene , with oliue girlond cround

Leaping like wanton kids in pleasant Spring
So towards old Syluanus they her bring

And aged limbs on Cypresse stadle stout
And with an yuie twyne his wast is girt about

They drawing nigh , vnto their God present
That flowre of faith and beautie excellent

His owne faire Dryope now he thinkes not faire
And Pholoe fowle , when her to this he doth compaire

To thinke of wight so faire , but gazing stood
In doubt to deeme her borne of earthly brood

Sometimes Diana he her takes to bee
But misseth bow , and shaftes , and buskins to her knee

How faire he was , and yet not faire to this
And how he slew with glauncing dart amisse

For griefe whereof the lad n'ould after ioy
But pynd away in anguish and selfe-wild annoy

Flocke all about to see her louely face
But when they vewed haue her heauenly grace

But all the Satyres scorne their woody kind
And henceforth nothing faire , but her on earth they find

To gather breath in many miseries
During which time her gentle wit she plyes

But when their bootlesse zeale she did restraine
FrÃƒÂµ her own worship , they her Asse would worship fayn

From whence he tooke his well deserued name
He had in armes abroad wonne muchell fame

And euer lou 'd to fight for Ladies right
But in vaine glorious frayes he litle did delight

Faire Thyamis the daughter of Labryde
That was in sacred bands of wedlocke tyde

And chase the saluage beast with busie payne
Then serue his Ladies loue , and wast in pleasures vayne

And seeke her spouse , that from her still does fly
And followes other game and venery

The loyall links of wedlocke did vnbind
And made her person thrall vnto his beastly kind

And bore a boy vnto that saluage sire
Then home he suffred her for to retire

He noursled vp in life and manners wilde
Emongst wild beasts and woods , from lawes of men exilde

Vpon the Lyon and the rugged Beare
And from the she Beares teats her whelps to teare

And the Robuckes in flight to ouertake
That euery beast for feare of him did fly and quake

And oft for dread of hurt would him aduise
The angry beasts not rashly to despise

( A lesson hard ) and make the Libbard sterne
Leaue roaring , when in rage he for reuenge did earne

The Pardale swift , and the Tigre cruell
The Antelope , and Wolfe both fierce and fell

And sturdie courage tame with dreadfull aw
That his beheast they feared , as tyrans law

After his sportes , and cruell pastime donne
When after him a Lyonesse did runne

The Lyon whelpes she saw how he did beare
And lull in rugged armes , withouten childish feare

She hardly yet perswaded was to stay
And then to him these womanish words gan say

To dally thus with death , is no fit toy
Go find some other play-fellowes , mine own sweet boy

Walkt in that forest , whom he had not taught
To feare his force : and then his courage haught

In which his might was neuer ouerthrowne
But through all Faery lond his famous worth was blown

To see his sire and offspring auncient
And now he thither came for like intent

Teaching the Satyres , which her sat around
Trew sacred lore , which from her sweet lips did redound

Gan her admire , and her sad sorrowes rew
Blaming of Fortune , which such troubles threw

Thenceforth he kept her goodly company
And learnd her discipline of faith and veritie

But her deare heart with anguish did torment
And all her wit in secret counsels spent

Who glad to gain such fauour , gan deuise
How with that pensiue Maid he best might thence arise

He led away with courage stout and bold
Too late it was , to Satyres to be told

So fast he carried her with carefull paine
That they the woods are past , & come now to the plaine

And towards him they gan in hast to ride
To weet of newes , that did abroad betide

For feare as seemd , or for some feigned losse
More greedy they of newes , fast towards him do crosse

And face all tand with scorching sunny ray
As he had traueild many a sommers day

His wearie limbes vpon : and eke behind
His scrip did hang , in which his needments he did bind

Then Vna gan to aske , if ought he knew
Or heard abroad of that her champion trew

To tell the sad sight , which mine eies haue red
These eyes did see that knight both liuing and eke ded

With dying fit , that downe she fell for paine
The knight her lightly reared vp againe

The further processe of her hidden griefe
The lesser pangs can beare , who hath endur 'd the chiefe

( A sory sight ) arraung 'd in battell new
Both breathing vengeaunce , both of wrathfull hew

That drunke with bloud , yet thristed after life
What more ? the Redcrosse knight was slaine with Paynim knife

The thing , that might not be , and yet was donne
Where is ( said Satyrane ) that Paynims sonne

Foreby a fountaine , where I late him left
Washing his bloudy wounds , that through the steele were cleft

And soone he came , as he the place had ghest
Whereas that Pagan proud him selfe did rest

Faire Vna : whom when Satyrane espide
With fowle reprochfull words he boldly him defide

That good knight of the Redcrosse to haue slain
Arise , and with like treason now maintain

And catching vp in hast his three square shield
And shining helmet , soone him buckled to the field

Yet ill thou blamest me , for hauing blent
My name with guile and traiterous intent

Th'enchaunter vaine his errour should not rew
But thou his errour shalt , I hope now prouen trew

That with their force they perst both plate and maile
And made wide furrowes in their fleshes fraile

But floods of bloud could not them satisfie
Both hungred after death : both chose to win , or die

As when two Bores with rancling malice met
Their gory sides fresh bleeding fiercely fret

And trample th'earth , the whiles they may respire
Then backe to fight againe , new breathed and entire

With heaped strokes more hugely , then before
That with their drerie wounds and bloudy gore

Led with their noise , which through the aire was thrown
Arriu 'd , where they in erth their fruitles bloud had sown

And left the doubtfull battell hastily
To catch her , newly offred to his eie

Then hunt the steps of pure vnspotted Maid
Wherewith he all enrag 'd , these bitter speaches said

Then that thou hadst repented it too late
Most sencelesse man he , that himselfe doth hate

So they to fight ; the whiles the royall Mayd
Fled farre away , of that proud Paynim sore afrayd

And much reioyced in their bloudy fray
But when he saw the Damsell passe away

But for to tell her lamentable cace
And eke this battels end , will need another place

And cast her colours dyed deepe in graine
To seeme like Truth , whose shape she well can faine

Great maistresse of her art was that false Dame
The false Duessa , cloked with Fidessaes name

Her hoped pray , she would no lenger bide
But forth she went , to seeke him far and wide

Disarmed all of yron-coted Plate
And by his side his steed the grassy forage ate

Wherein the cherefull birds of sundry kind
Do chaunt sweet musick , to delight his mind

Vpbrayd , for leauing her in place vnmeet
With fowle words tempring faire , soure gall with hony sweet

And with greene boughes decking a gloomy glade
About the fountaine like a girlond made

The sacred Nymph , which therein wont to dwell
Was out of Dianes fauour , as it then befell

Sat downe to rest in middest of the race
The goddesse wroth gan fowly her disgrace

Thenceforth her waters waxed dull and slow
And all that drunke thereof , did faint and feeble grow

Eftsoones his manly forces gan to faile
And mightie strong was turnd to feeble fraile

And chearefull bloud in faintnesse chill did melt
Which like a feuer fit through all his body swelt

Till at the last he heard a dreadfull sownd
Which through the wood loud bellowing , did rebownd

Vpstarted lightly from his looser make
And his vnready weapons gan in hand to take

An hideous Geant horrible and hye
That with his talnesse seemd to threat the skye

Ne durst behold : his stature did exceed
The hight of three the tallest sonnes of mortall seed

Her hollow womb did secretly inspire
And fild her hidden caues with stormie yre

Brought forth this monstrous masse of earthly slime
Puft vp with emptie wind , and fild with sinfull crime

All other powres and knighthood he did scorne
Such now he marcheth to this man forlorne

Out of his mothers bowelles , and it made
His mortall mace , wherewith his foemen he dismayde

Who haplesse , and eke hopelesse , all in vaine
Did to him pace , sad battaile to darrayne

Through that fraile fountaine , which him feeble made
That scarsely could he weeld his bootlesse single blade

He had beene pouldred all , as thin as flowre
But he was wary of that deadly stowre

That with the wind it did him ouerthrow
And all his sences stound , that still he lay full low

And ramd with bullet round , ordaind to kill
Conceiueth fire , the heauens it doth fill

Through smouldry cloud of duskish stincking smoke
That th'onely breath him daunts , who hath escapt the stroke

Vntill Duessa loud to him gan crye
O great Orgoglio , greatest vnder skye

But vanquisht thine eternall bondslaue make
And me thy worthy meed vnto thy Leman take

Who her as willingly to grace did take
And was possessed of his new found make

Him to his castle brought with hastie forse
And in a Dongeon deepe him threw without remorse

And triple crowne set on her head full hye
And her endowd with royall maiestye

A monstrous beast ybred in filthy fen
He chose , which he had kept long time in darksome den

Whose many heads out budding euer new
Did breed him endlesse labour to subdew

An yron brest , and backe of scaly bras
And all embrewd in bloud , his eyes did shine as glas

The euer-burning lamps from thence it braught
And prowdly threw to ground , as things of naught

Vpon this dreadfull Beast with seuenfold head
He set the false Duessa , for more aw and dread

When all was past , tooke vp his forlorne weed
His mightie armour , missing most at need

The ruefull moniments of heauinesse
And with them all departes , to tell his great distresse

Whilest Satyrane him from pursuit did let
Who when her eyes she on the Dwarf had set

And liuely breath her sad brest did forsake
Yet might her pitteous hart be seene to pant and quake

At last recouering hart , he does begin
To rub her temples , and to chaufe her chin

Vnto her natiue prison to retourne
Then gins her grieued ghost thus to lament and mourne

Or liking find to gaze on earthly mould
Sith cruell fates the carefull threeds vnfould

Perce to my hart , and pas through euery side
And let eternall night so sad [ sight ] fro me hide

Henceforth thy hated face for euer hyde
And shut vp heauens windowes shyning wyde

Mine eyes no more on vanitie shall feed
But seeled vp with death , shall haue their deadly meed

And thrise he her reviu 'd with busie paine
At last when life recouer 'd had the raine

Tell on ( quoth she ) the wofull Tragedie
The which these reliques sad present vnto mine eie

Then that I feele , and harbour in mine hart
Who hath endur 'd the whole , can beare each part

Begin , and end the bitter balefull stound
If lesse , then that I feare , more fauour I haue found

Bought with the bloud of vanquisht Paynim bold
The wretched payre transform 'd to treen mould

The lucklesse conflict with the Gyant stout
Wherein captiu 'd , of life or death he stood in doubt

And almost rent her tender hart in tway
And loue fresh coles vnto her fire did lay

Then she did loue the knight of the Redcrosse
For whose deare sake so many troubles her did tosse

All as the Dwarfe the way to her assynd
And euermore in constant carefull mind

High ouer hils , and low adowne the dale
She wandred many a wood , and measurd many a vale

His glitterand armour shined farre away
Like glauncing light of Phoebus brightest ray

Athwart his brest a bauldrick braue he ware
That shynd , like twinkling stars , with stons most pretious rare

Like Hesperus emongst the lesser lights
And stroue for to amaze the weaker sights

Whose hilts were burnisht gold , and handle strong
Of mother pearle , and buckled with a golden tong

With greedie pawes , and ouer all did spred
His golden wings : his dreadfull hideous hed

That suddeine horror to faint harts did show
And scaly tayle was stretcht adowne his backe full low

Did shake , and seem 'd to daunce for iollity
Like to an Almond tree ymounted hye

Whose tender locks do tremble euery one
At euery little breath , that vnder heauen is blowne

Such earthly mettals soone consumed bene
But all of Diamond perfect pure and cleene

That point of speare it neuer percen could
Ne dint of direfull sword diuide the substance would

Or when the flying heauens he would affray
For so exceeding shone his glistring ray

And siluer Cynthia wexed pale and faint
As when her face is staynd with magicke arts constraint

Before that shield did fade , and suddeine fall
And when him list the raskall routes appall

And when him list the prouder lookes subdew
He would them gazing blind , or turne to other hew

It Merlin was , which whylome did excell
All liuing wightes in might of magicke spell

But when he dyde , the Faerie Queene it brought
To Faerie lond , where yet it may be seene , if sought

Had riuen many a brest with pikehead square
A goodly person , and could menage faire

And chauft , that any on his backe should sit
The yron rowels into frothy fome he bit

Some secret sorrow did her heart distraine
Which to allay , and calme her storming paine

To tempt the cause it selfe for to bewray
Wherewith emmou 'd , these bleeding words she gan to say

The carefull cold beginneth for to creepe
And in my heart his yron arrow steepe

Then rip vp griefe , where it may not auaile
My last left comfort is , my woes to weepe and waile

Whiles thus I heare you of your sorrowes treat
But wofull Ladie let me you intrete

And counsell mittigates the greatest smart
Found neuer helpe , who neuer would his hurts impart

Could neuer : will to might giues greatest aid
But griefe ( quoth she ) does greater grow displaid

No faith so fast ( quoth she ) but flesh does paire
Flesh may empaire ( quoth he ) but reason can repaire

Which loue and fortune in her heart had wrought
And said ; faire Sir , I hope good hap hath brought

Or that your prowesse can me yield reliefe
Then heare the storie sad , which I shall tell you briefe

Whose parents deare , whilest equall destinies
Did runne about , and their felicities

Which Phison and Euphrates floweth by
And Gehons golden waues doe wash continually

With murdrous rauine , and deuouring might
Their kingdome spoild , and countrey wasted quight

Where fast embard in mightie brasen wall
He has them now foure yeres besiegd to make thÃ¡ÂºÂ½ thrall

Haue thither come the noble Martiall crew
That famous hard atchieuements still pursew

All they for want of faith , or guilt of sin
The pitteous pray of his fierce crueltie haue bin

That noble order hight of Maidenhed
Forthwith to court of Gloriane I sped

There to obtaine some such redoubted knight
That Parents deare from tyrants powre deliuer might

Had neuer bene , ne euer by his might
Had throwne to ground the vnregarded right

The groning ghosts of many one dismaide
Haue felt the bitter dint of his auenging blade

Can speake his prowesse , that did earst you beare
And well could rule : now he hath left you heare

O heauie record of the good Redcrosse
Where haue you left your Lord , that could so well you tosse

His sence abusd , and made him to misdeeme
My loyalty , not such as it did seeme

How I him lou 'd , and loue with all my might
So thought I eke of him , and thinke I thought aright

Where neuer foot of liuing wight did tread
That brought not backe the balefull body dead

Who with her witchcraft and misseeming sweete
Inueigled him to follow her desires vnmeete

Vnwares surprised , and with mightie mall
The monster mercilesse him made to fall

Remedilesse , for aie he doth him hold
This is my cause of griefe , more great , then may be told

That stoutest heart , I weene , could cause to quake
But be of cheare , and comfort to you take

His chearefull words reuiu 'd her chearelesse spright
So forth they went , the Dwarfe them guiding euer right

And stedfast truth acquite him out of all
Her loue is firme , her care continuall

Else should this Redcrosse knight in bands haue dyde
For whose deliuerÃƒÂ£ce she this Prince doth thither guide

In which my Lord my liege doth lucklesse lie
Thrall to that Gyants hatefull tyrannie

From loftie steede , and bad the Ladie stay
To see what end of fight should him befall that day

To ward the same , nor answere commers call
Then tooke that Squire an horne of bugle small

Of that same hornes great vertues weren told
Which had approued bene in vses manifold

And Ecchoes three answerd it selfe againe
No false enchauntment , nor deceiptfull traine

No gate so strong , no locke so firme and fast
But with that percing noise flew open quite , or brast

The Gyant selfe dismaied with that sownd
Where he with his Duessa dalliance fownd

And staggering steps , to weet , what suddein stowre
Had wrought that horror strange , and dar 'd his dreaded powre

And euery head was crowned on his creast
And bloudie mouthed with late cruell feast

And at him fiercely flew , with courage fild
And eger greedinesse through euery member thrild

All arm 'd with ragged snubbes and knottie graine
Him thought at first encounter to haue slaine

Did faire auoide the violence him nere
It booted nought , to thinke , such thunderbolts to beare

Did fall to ground , and with his heauie sway
So deepely dinted in the driuen clay

Did grone full grieuous vnderneath the blow
And trembling with strange feare , did like an earthquake show

Enrold in flames , and smouldring dreriment
Through riuen cloudes and molten firmament

And all that might his angrie passage stay
And shooting in the earth , casts vp a mount of clay

And whiles he stroue his combred clubbe to quight
Out of the earth , with blade all burning bright

Large streames of bloud out of the truncked stocke
Forth gushed , like fresh water streame from riuen rocke

That all the fields rebellowed againe
As great a noyse , as when in Cymbrian plaine

And fill the fields with troublous bellowing
The neighbour woods around with hollow murmur ring

Her dreadfull beast , who swolne with bloud of late
Came ramping forth with proud presumpteous gate

Encountring fierce with single sword in hand
And twixt him and his Lord did like a bulwarke stand

That stop out of the way to ouerthroe
Scorning the let of so vnequall foe

But with outrageous strokes did him restraine
And with his bodie bard the way atwixt them twaine

And secret poyson through their inner parts
Th'eternall bale of heauie wounded harts

Therewith his sturdie courage soone was quayd
And all his senses were with suddeine dread dismayd

No powre he had to stirre , nor will to rize
That when the carefull knight gan well auise

For wondrous anguish in his hart it wrought
To see his loued Squire into such thraldome brought

His monstrous scalpe downe to his teeth it tore
And that misformed shape mis-shaped more

And ouerflowed all the field around
That ouer shoes in bloud he waded on the ground

Through great impatience of his grieued hed
His gorgeous ryder from her loftie sted

Who all enrag 'd with smart and franticke yre
Came hurtling in full fierce , and forst the knight retyre

With which his hideous club aloft he dites
And at his foe with furious rigour smites

That to the ground it doubleth him full low
What mortall wight could euer beare so monstrous blow

Such blazing brightnesse through the aier threw
That eye mote not the same endure to vew

His weapon huge , that heaued was on hye
For to haue slaine the man , that on the ground did lye

That downe he tumbled on the durtie field
And seem 'd himselfe as conquered to yield

Vnto the Gyant loudly she gan call
O helpe Orgoglio , helpe , or else we perish all

But all in vaine : for he has read his end
In that bright shield , and all their forces spend

As where th'Almighties lightning brond does light
It dimmes the dazed eyen , and daunts the senses quight

And smote off quite his right leg by the knee
That downe he tombled ; as an aged tree

The mightie trunck halfe rent , with ragged rift
Doth roll adowne the rocks , and fall with fearefull drift

And her foundation forst , and feebled quight
At last downe falles , and with her heaped hight

Such was this Gyaunts fall , that seemd to shake
The stedfast globe of earth , as it for feare did quake

All wallowd in his owne fowle bloudy gore
Which flowed from his wounds in wondrous store

Was vanisht quite , and of that monstrous mas
Was nothing left , but like an emptie bladder was

Such percing griefe her stubborne hart did wound
That she could not endure that dolefull stound

And by hard meanes enforcing her to stay
So brought vnto his Lord , as his deserued pray

Came running fast to greet his victorie
With sober gladnesse , and myld modestie

That with your worth the world amazed make
How shall I quite the paines , ye suffer for my sake

Wherewith you to reward ? Accept therefore
My simple selfe , and seruice euermore

Behold what ye this day haue done for mee
And what I can not quite , requite with vsuree

And well begun end all so well , I pray
Ne let that wicked woman scape away

Where he his better dayes hath wasted all
O heare , how piteous he to you for ayd does call

Into the Castle entred forcibly
Where liuing creature none he did espye

There raignd a solemne silence ouer all
Nor voice was heard , nor wight was seene in bowre or hall

And guide his wearie gate both too and fro
For his eye sight him failed long ygo

Those were the keyes of euery inner dore
But he could not them vse , but kept them still in store

So backward still was turnd his wrincled face
Vnlike to men , who euer as they trace

And foster father of the Gyant dead
His name Ignaro did his nature right aread

Which in that stately building wont to dwell
Who answerd him full soft , he could not tell

Had made his caytiue thrall ; againe he sayde
He could not tell : ne euer other answere made

And said , Old sire , it seemes thou hast not red
How ill it sits with that same siluer hed

With natures pen , in ages graue degree
Aread in grauer wise , what I demaund of thee

He ghest his nature by his countenance
And calmd his wrath with goodly temperance

Each dore he opened without any breach
There was no barre to stop , nor foe him to empeach

That greatest Princes presence might behold
But all the floore ( too filthy to be told

Defiled was , that dreadfull was to vew
And sacred ashes ouer it was strowed new

And holy Martyrs often doen to dye
With cruell malice and strong tyranny

And with great griefe were often heard to grone
That hardest heart would bleede , to heare their piteous mone

That fast was lockt , but key found not at all
Emongst that bounch , to open it withall

With all his powre , to weet , if liuing wight
Were housed therewithin , whom he enlargen might

Of death , that here lye dying euery stound
Yet liue perforce in balefull darkenesse bound

Since I the heauens chearefull face did vew
O welcome thou , that doest of death bring tydings trew

For ruth of gentle knight so fowle forlore
Which shaking off , he rent that yron dore

But all a deepe descent , as darke as hell
That breathed euer forth a filthie banefull smell

But that with constant zeale , and courage bold
After long paines and labours manifold

His pined corse , him scarse to light could beare
A ruefull spectacle of death and ghastly drere

And empty sides deceiued of their dew
Could make a stony hart his hap to rew

Were cleane consum 'd , and all his vitall powres
Decayd , and all his flesh shronk vp like withered flowres

Who earst in flowres of freshest youth was clad
Tho when her well of teares she wasted had

That of your selfe ye thus berobbed arre
And this misseeming hew your manly looks doth marre

Whose wrathfull wreakes them selues do now alay
And for these wrongs shall treble penaunce pay

Had no delight to treaten of his griefe
His long endured famine needed more reliefe

Best musicke breeds delight in loathing eare
But th'onely good , that growes of passed feare

Deepe written in my heart with yron pen
That blisse may not abide in state of mortall men

And loe that wicked woman in your sight
The roote of all your care , and wretched plight

And shame t'auenge so weake an enimy
But spoile her of her scarlot robe , and let her fly

Ne spared they to strip her naked all
Then when they had despoild her tire and call

A loathly , wrinckled hag , ill fauoured , old
Whose secret filth good manners biddeth not be told

Her teeth out of her rotten gummes were feld
And her sowre breath abhominably smeld

Her wrizled skin as rough , as maple rind
So scabby was , that would haue loathd all womankind

A foxes taile , with dong all fowly dight
And eke her feete most monstrous were in sight

The other like a Beares vneuen paw
More vgly shape yet neuer liuing creature saw

Such is the face of falshood , such the sight
Of fowle Duessa , when her borrowed light

And all her filthy feature open showne
They let her goe at will , and wander wayes vnknowne

From liuing eyes her open shame to hide
And lurkt in rocks and caues long vnespide

To rest them selues , and weary powres repaire
Where store they found of all , that dainty was and rare

In braue poursuit of cheualrous emprize
That none did others safety despize

How to aduaunce with fauourable hands
As this good Prince redeemd the Redcrosse knight from bands

Them list no lenger there at leasure dwell
But forward fare , as their aduentures fell

Least so great good , as he for her had wrought
Should die vnknown , & buried be in thanklesse thought

From which I sprong , from me are hidden yit
For all so soone as life did me admit

And streight deliuered to a Faery knight
To be vpbrought in gentle thewes and martiall might

And is the wisest now on earth I weene
His dwelling is low in a valley greene

His tombling billowes rolls with gentle rore
There all my dayes he traind me vp in vertuous lore

And Tutours nouriture to ouersee
Him oft and oft I askt in priuitie

That I was sonne and heire vnto a king
As time in her iust terme the truth to light should bring

Hath brought you hither into Faery land
Aread Prince Arthur , crowne of Martiall band

The secret meaning of th'eternall might
That rules mens wayes , and rules the thoughts of liuing wight

Whilome doth rancle in my riuen brest
With forced fury following his behest

Ah curteous knight ( quoth she ) what secret wound
Could euer find , to grieue the gentlest hart on ground

Till liuing moysture into smoke do flow
And wasted life do lye in ashes low

I will reuele , what ye so much desire
Ah Loue , lay downe thy bow , the whiles I may respire

To kindle loue in euery liuing brest
But me had warnd old Timons wise behest

As miserable louers vse to rew
Which still wex old in woe , whiles woe still wexeth new

In middest of their mournfull Tragedy
Ay wont to laugh , when them I heard to cry

Shot many a dart at me with fiers intent
But I them warded all with wary gouernment

Or vnawares at disauantage found
Nothing is sure , that growes on earthly ground

Doth soonest fall in disauentrous fight
And yeeldes his caytiue neck to victours most despight

Did soone pluck downe , and curbd my libertie
For on a day prickt forth with iollitie

The fields , the floods , the heauens with one consent
Did seeme to laugh on me , and fauour mine intent

And pillow was my helmet faire displayd
Whiles euery sence the humour sweet embayd

Her daintie limbes full softly down did lay
So faire a creature yet saw neuer sunny day

As when iust time expired should appeare
But whether dreames delude , or true it were

As she to me deliuered all that night
And at her parting said , She Queene of Faeries hight

And washed all her place with watry eyen
From that day forth I lou 'd that face diuine

And neuer vow to rest , till her I find
Nine monethes I seeke in vaine yet ni 'll that vow vnbind

And hide the smoke , that did his fire display
Till gentle Vna thus to him gan say

Defend thine honour , and thy foes confound
True Loues are oftÃ¡ÂºÂ½ sown , but seldom grow on ground

Whose wondrous faith , exceeding earthly race
Was firmest fixt in mine extremest case

For onely worthy you through prowes priefe
Yf liuing man mote worthy be , to be her liefe

With fresh desire his voyage to pursew
Als Vna earnd her traueill to renew

Gaue goodly gifts , the signes of gratefull mynd
And eke as pledges firme , right hands together ioynd

Of wondrous worth , and vertue excellent
That any wound could heale incontinent

Was writ with golden letters rich and braue
A worke of wondrous grace , and able soules to saue

But she now weighing the decayed plight
And shrunken synewes of her chosen knight

Till he recouered had his former hew
For him to be yet weake and wearie well she knew

Or other griesly thing , that him agast
Still as he fled , his eye was backward cast

And with his winged heeles did tread the wind
As he had beene a fole of Pegasus his kind

Nor drop of bloud in all his face appeares
Nor life in limbe : and to increase his feares

That with his glistring armes does ill agree
But he of rope or armes has now no memoree

That of him selfe he seemd to be afrayd
Whom hardly he from flying forward stayd

And eke from whom make ye this hasty flight
For neuer knight I saw in such misseeming plight

Astonisht stood , as one that had aspide
Infernall furies , with their chaines vntide

But trembling euery ioynt did inly quake
And foltring tongue at last these words seemd forth to shake

But he him forst to stay , and tellen free
The secret cause of his perplexitie

But through his boldnesse rather feare did reach
Yet forst , at last he made through silence suddein breach

That I may tell this haplesse history
Feare nought : ( quoth he ) no daunger now is nye

I late beheld , and had not greater grace
Me reft from it , had bene partaker of the place

In all affaires , and was both bold and free
But not so happie as mote happie bee

For she was proud , and of too high intent
And ioyd to see her louer languish and lament

That cursed wight , from whom I scapt whyleare
A man of hell , that cals himselfe Despaire

So creeping close , as Snake in hidden weedes
Inquireth of our states , and of our knightly deedes

With wounding words and termes of foule repriefe
He pluckt from vs all hope of due reliefe

Perswade vs die , to stint all further strife
To me he lent this rope , to him a rustie knife

But I more fearefull , or more luckie wight
Dismayd with that deformed dismall sight

Whose like infirmitie like chaunce may beare
But God you neuer let his charmed speeches heare

That like would not for all this worldes wealth
His subtill tongue , like dropping honny , mealt'th

His powre is reft , and weaknesse doth remaine
O neuer Sir desire to try his guilefull traine

Of grace do me vnto his cabin guide
I that hight Treuisan ( quoth he ) will ride

By you , when ye arriue in that same place
For leuer had I die , then see his deadly face

Darke , dolefull , drearie , like a greedie graue
That still for carrion carcases doth craue

Farre from that haunt all other chearefull fowle
And all about it wandring ghostes did waile and howle

On which had many wretches hanged beene
Whose carcases were scattered on the greene

Would faine haue fled , ne durst approchen neare
But th'other forst him stay , and comforted in feare

His griesie lockes , long growen , and vnbound
Disordred hong about his shoulders round

His raw-bone cheekes through penurie and pine
Were shronke into his iawes , as he did neuer dine

And him beside there lay vpon the gras
A drearie corse , whose life away did pas

In which a rustie knife fast fixed stood
And made an open passage for the gushing flood

With firie zeale he burnt in courage bold
Him to auenge , before his bloud were cold

What iustice can but iudge against thee right
With thine owne bloud to price his bloud , here shed in sight

But he should die , who merites not to liue
None else to death this man despayring driue

Or let him die , that loatheth liuing breath
Or let him die at ease , that liueth here vneath

Is not great grace to helpe him ouer past
Or free his feet , that in the myre sticke fast

Why wilt not let him passe , that long hath stood
Vpon the banke , yet wilt thy selfe not passe the flood

What if some litle paine the passage haue
That makes fraile flesh to feare the bitter waue

Sleepe after toyle , port after stormie seas
Ease after warre , death after life does greatly please

The souldier may not moue from watchfull sted
Nor leaue his stand , vntill his Captaine bed

And he , that points the Centonell his roome
Doth license him depart at sound of morning droome

Their times in his eternall booke of fate
Are written sure , and haue their certaine date

Or shunne the death ordaynd by destinie
WhÃ¡ÂºÂ½ houre of death is come , let none aske whence , nor why

Through strife , and bloud-shed , and auengement
Now praysd , hereafter deare thou shalt repent

For he , that once hath missed the right way
The further he doth goe , the further he doth stray

For what hath life , that may it loued make
And giues not rather cause it to forsake

And euer fickle fortune rageth rife
All which , and thousands mo do make a loathsome life

More lucklesse disauentures did amate
Witnesse the dongeon deepe , wherein of late

Yet death then , would the like mishaps forestall
Into the which hereafter thou maiest happen fall

High heaped vp with huge iniquitie
Against the day of wrath , to burden thee

And sold thy selfe to serue Duessa vilde
With whom in all abuse thou hast thy selfe defilde

And guiltie be of thine impietie
Is not his law , Let euery sinner die

Then linger , till the glasse be all out ronne
Death is the end of woes : die soone , O faeries sonne

Well knowing true all , that he did reherse
And to his fresh remembrance did reuerse

As he were charmed with inchaunted rimes
That oftentimes he quakt , and fainted oftentimes

And hellish anguish did his soule assaile
To driue him to despaire , and quite to quaile

And thousand feends that doe them endlesse paine
With fire and brimstone , which for euer shall remaine

By righteous sentence of th'Almighties law
Then gan the villein him to ouercraw

And bad him choose , what death he would desire
For death was due to him , that had prouokt Gods ire

And tremble like a leafe of Aspin greene
And troubled bloud through his pale face was seene

At last resolu 'd to worke his finall smart
He lifted vp his hand , that backe againe did start

Out of his hand she snatcht the cursed knife
And threw it to the ground , enraged rife

Is this the battell , which thou vauntst to fight
With that fire-mouthed Dragon , horrible and bright

In heauenly mercies hast thou not a part
Why shouldst thou then despeire , that chosen art

And that accurst hand-writing doth deface
Arise , Sir knight arise , and leaue this cursed place

He chose an halter from among the rest
And with it hung himselfe , vnbid vnblest

Yet nathelesse it could not doe him die
Till he should die his last , that is eternally

Against spirituall foes , yeelds by and by
Or from the field most cowardly doth fly

If any strength we haue , it is to ill
But all the good is Gods , both power and eke will

Through long enprisonment , and hard constraint
Which he endured in his late restraint

She cast to bring him , where he chearen might
Till he recouered had his late decayed plight

It gouernd was , and guided euermore
Through wisedome of a matrone graue and hore

All night she spent in bidding of her bedes
And all the day in doing good and godly deedes

In goodly thewes , and godly exercise
The eldest two most sober , chast , and wise

But faire Charissa to a louely fere
Was lincked , and by him had many pledges dere

The Porter opened vnto them streight way
He was an aged syre , all hory gray

Hight HumiltÃƒÂ¡ . They passe in stouping low
For streight & narrow was the way , which he did show

Where them does meete a francklin faire and free
And entertaines with comely courteous glee

Did labour liuely to expresse the same
And gladly did them guide , till to the Hall they came

In word and deede that shew 'd great modestie
And knew his good to all of each degree

But simple true , and eke vnfained sweet
As might become a Squire so great persons to greet

Which doen , she vp arose with seemely grace
And toward them full matronely did pace

Her hart with ioy vnwonted inly sweld
As feeling wondrous comfort in her weaker eld

That to redeeme thy woefull parents head
From tyrans rage , and euer-dying dread

What grace hath thee now hither brought this way
Or doen thy feeble feet vnweeting hither stray

That chose the narrow path , or seeke the right
All keepe the broad high way , and take delight

Then with a few to walke the rightest way
O foolish men , why haste ye to your owne decay

Led with thy prayses and broad-blazed fame
That vp to heauen is blowne . The auncient Dame

With all the court'sies , that she could deuise
Ne wanted ought , to shew her bounteous or wise

With countenance demure , and modest grace
They numberd euen steps and equall pace

That could haue dazd the rash beholders sight
And round about her head did shine like heauens light

In which a Serpent did himselfe enfold
That horrour made to all , that did behold

A booke , that was both signd and seald with blood
Wherein darke things were writ , hard to be vnderstood

As was her sister ; whether dread did dwell
Or anguish in her hart , is hard to tell

And euer vp to heauen , as she did pray
Her stedfast eyes were bent , ne swarued other way

And greatly ioy each other well to see
Then to the knight with shamefast modestie

Who faire them quites , as him beseemed best
And goodly gan discourse of many a noble gest

Ah no , said they , but forth she may not come
For she of late is lightned of her wombe

Indeede ( quoth she ) that should her trouble sore
But thankt be God , and her encrease so euermore

Ye both forwearied be : therefore a whyle
I read you rest , and to your bowres recoyle

Of puissant armes , and laid in easie bed
His name was meeke Obedience rightfully ared

To haue her knight into her schoolehouse plaste
That of her heauenly learning he might taste

That she him taught celestiall discipline
And opened his dull eyes , that light mote in them shine

And heauenly documents thereout did preach
That weaker wit of man could neuer reach

For she was able , with her words to kill
And raise againe to life the hart , that she did thrill

Sometimes great hostes of men she could dismay
Dry-shod to passe , she parts the flouds in tway

And throw in raging sea with roaring threat
Almightie God her gaue such powre , and puissance great

That wretched world he gan for to abhore
And mortall life gan loath , as thing forlore

That he desirde to end his wretched dayes
So much the dart of sinfull guilt the soule dismayes

Else had his sinnes so great , and manifold
Made him forget all that Fidelia told

Disdeining life , desiring leaue to die
She found her selfe assayld with great perplexitie

Her wisely comforted all that she might
With goodly counsell and aduisement right

In that disease of grieued conscience
And well could cure the same ; His name was Patience

Well searcht , eftsoones he gan apply reliefe
Of salues and med'cines , which had passing priefe

And much asswag 'd the passion of his plight
That he his paine endur 'd , as seeming now more light

And festring sore did rankle yet within
Close creeping twixt the marrow and the skin

Whereas he meant his corrosiues to apply
And with streight diet tame his stubborne malady

The swelling of his wounds to mitigate
And made him pray both earely and eke late

To pluck it out with pincers firie whot
That soone in him was left no one corrupted iot

That drops of bloud thence like a well did play
And sad Repentance vsed to embay

So in short space they did to health restore
The man that would not liue , but earst lay at deathes dore

His owne deare Vna hearing euermore
His ruefull shriekes and gronings , often tore

Yet all with patience wisely she did beare
For well she wist , his crime could else be neuer cleare

Him dearely kist , and fairely eke besought
Himselfe to chearish , and consuming thought

Was woxen strong , and left her fruitfull nest
To her faire Vna brought this vnacquainted guest

That was on earth not easie to compare
Full of great loue , but Cupids wanton snare

That ay thereof her babes might sucke their fill
The rest was all in yellow robes arayed still

But thrust them forth still , as they wexed old
And on her head she wore a tyre of gold

And by her side there sate a gentle paire
Of turtle doues , she sitting in an yuorie chaire

And entertaines with friendly chearefull mood
Then Vna her besought , to be so good

In that sad house of Penaunce , where his spright
Had past the paines of hell , and long enduring night

Of loue , and righteousnesse , and well to donne
And wrath , and hatred warely to shonne

In which when him she well instructed hath
From thence to heauen she teacheth him the ready path

Her name was Mercie , well knowne ouer all
To be both gratious , and eke liberall

In all his wayes through this wide worldes waue
That Mercy in the end his righteous soule might saue

Which still before him she remou 'd away
That nothing might his ready passage stay

She held him fast , and firmely did vpbeare
As carefull Nourse her child from falling oft does reare

Their life to seruice of high heauens king
Did spend their dayes in doing godly thing

And one sate wayting euer them before
To call in-commers by , that needy were and pore

His office was to giue entertainement
And lodging , vnto all that came , and went

But such , as want of harbour did constraine
Those for Gods sake his dewty was to entertaine

He feard not once him selfe to be in need
Ne car 'd to hoord for those , whom he did breede

He had enough , what need him care for more
And had he lesse , yet some he would giue to the pore

But clothes meet to keepe keene could away
And naked nature seemely to aray

And if that no spare cloths to giue he had
His owne coate he would cut , and it distribute glad

From Turkes and Sarazins , which them had stayd
And though they faultie were , yet well he wayd

And he that harrowd hell with heauie stowre
The faultie soules from thence brought to his heauenly bowre

When sin , and hell , and death do most dismay
The feeble soule departing hence away

O man haue mind of that last bitter throw
For as the tree does fall , so lyes it euer low

That to their heauenly spouse both sweet and braue
They might appeare , when he their soules shall saue

All in his hand , euen dead we honour should
Ah dearest God me graunt , I dead be not defould

In face of iudgement he their right would plead
Ne ought the powre of mighty men did dread

And when they stood in most necessitee
He did supply their want , and gaue them euer free

Where seeing Mercie , that his steps vp bare
And alwayes led , to her with reuerence rare

For of their order she was Patronesse
Albe Charissa were their chiefest founderesse

And godly worke of Almes and charitee
She him instructed with great industree

His mortall life he learned had to frame
In holy righteousnesse , without rebuke or blame

And eke a litle Hermitage thereby
Wherein an aged holy man did lye

His name was heauenly Contemplation
Of God and goodnesse was his meditation

And through great age had lost their kindly sight
Yet wondrous quick and persant was his spright

That his frayle thighes nigh wearie and fordonne
Gan faile , but by her helpe the top at last he wonne

The mossy braunches of an Oke halfe ded
Each bone might through his body well be red

His mind was full of spirituall repast
And pyn 'd his flesh , to keepe his body low and chast

And had he not that Dame respected more
Whom highly he did reuerence and adore

Who well them greeting , humbly did requight
And asked , to what end they clomb that tedious height

Is not from hence the way , that leadeth right
To that most glorious house , that glistreth bright

By wise Fidelia ? she doth thee require
To shew it to this knight , according his desire

Who better can the way to heauen aread
Then thou thy selfe , that was both borne and bred

Present before the maiestie diuine
And his auenging wrath to clemencie incline

That neuer leads the traueiler astray
But after labours long , and sad delay

Till from her bands the spright assoiled is
And haue her strength recur 'd from fraile infirmitis

On either side disparted with his rod
Till that his army dry-foot through them yod

The bitter doome of death and balefull mone
He did receiue , whiles flashing fire about him shone

Of that deare Lord , who oft thereon was fownd
For euer with a flowring girlond crownd

On which the thrise three learned Ladies play
Their heauenly notes , and make full many a louely lay

Whose wals and towres were builded high and strong
Of perle and precious stone , that earthly tong

The Citie of the great king hight it well
Wherein eternall peace and happinesse doth dwell

And with great ioy into that Citie wend
As commonly as friend does with his frend

Her loftie towres vnto the starry sphere
And what vnknowen nation there empeopled were

His chosen people purg 'd from sinfull guilt
With pretious bloud , which cruelly was spilt

Now are they Saints all in that Citie sam
More deare vnto their God , then yoÃ…Â©glings to their dam

The fairest Citie was , that might be seene
And that bright towre all built of christall cleene

For this great Citie that does far surpas
And this bright Angels towre quite dims that towre of glas

And well beseemes all knights of noble name
That couet in th'immortall booke of fame

That glorie does to them for guerdon graunt
For she is heauenly borne , and heauen may iustly vaunt

To aide a virgin desolate foredonne
But when thou famous victorie hast wonne

And wash thy hands from guilt of bloudy field
For bloud can nought but sin , & wars but sorrowes yield

To yonder same Hierusalem do bend
Where is for thee ordaind a blessed end

And Patrone : thou Saint George shalt called bee
Saint George of mery England , the signe of victoree

( Quoth he ) as wretched , and liu 'd in like paine
But deeds of armes must I at last be faine

( Said he ) and battailes none are to be fought
As for loose loues they are vaine , and vanish into nought

Or streight way on that last long voyage fare
That nothing may my present hope empare

Who did her cause into thy hand commit
Till from her cursed foe thou haue her freely quit

To walke this way in Pilgrims poore estate
But now aread , old father , why of late

That word shall I ( said he ) auouchen good
Sith to thee is vnknowne the cradle of thy brood

High reard their royall throne in Britane land
And vanquisht them , vnable to withstand

And her base Elfin brood there for thee left
Such men do Chaungelings call , so chaungd by Faeries theft

As he his toylesome teme that way did guyde
And brought thee vp in ploughmans state to byde

To Faery court thou cam'st to seeke for fame
And proue thy puissaunt armes , as seemes thee best became

And taught the way that does to heauen bound
This said , adowne he looked to the ground

His feeble sence , and too exceeding shyne
So darke are earthly things compard to things diuine

Great thankes and goodly meed to that good syre
He thence departing gaue for his paines hyre

Of her aduenture mindfull for to bee
So leaue they take of Coelia , and her daughters three

Whereto whenas they now approched neare
With hartie words her knight she gan to cheare

That all these sorrowes suffer for my sake
High heauen behold the tedious toyle , ye for me take

Therefore henceforth be at your keeping well
And euer ready for your foeman fell

That shall ye euermore renowmed make
Aboue all knights on earth , that batteill vndertake

Whom I from far see on the walles appeare
Whose sight my feeble soule doth greatly cheare

That ÃƒÂ´ my parents might I happily
Vnto you bring , to ease you of your misery

Eftsoones that dreadfull Dragon they espide
Where stretcht he lay vpon the sunny side

Those glistring armes , that heauen with light did fill
He rousd himselfe full blith , and hastned them vntill

And eke be safe from daunger far descryde
She him obayd , and turnd a little wyde

The Nourse of time , and euerlasting fame
That warlike hands ennoblest with immortall name

And harts of great HeroÃƒ Â« s doest enrage
That nought their kindled courage may aswage

Thou doest awake , sleepe neuer he so sownd
And scared nations doest with horrour sterne astownd

Twixt that great faery Queene and Paynim king
That with their horrour heauen and earth did ring

And to my tunes thy second tenor rayse
That I this man of God his godly armes may blaze

And made wide shadow vnder his huge wast
As mountaine doth the valley ouercast

Which to increase his wondrous greatnesse more
Was swolne with wrath , & poyson , & with bloudy gore

With dint of sword , nor push of pointed speare
Which as an Eagle , seeing pray appeare

For as the clashing of an Armour bright
Such noyse his rouzed scales did send vnto the knight

And eke the pennes , that did his pineons bynd
Were like mayne-yards , with flying canuas lynd

The cloudes before him fled for terrour great
And all the heauens stood still amazed with his threat

And thicke entangled knots adown does slacke
Bespotted all with shields of red and blacke

And at the point two stings in-fixed arre
Both deadly sharpe , that sharpest steele exceeden farre

What euer thing does touch his rauenous pawes
Or what within his reach he euer drawes

Wide gaped , like the griesly mouth of hell
Through which into his darke abisse all rauin fell

Of late deuoured bodies did appeare
That sight thereof bred cold congealed feare

Out of his stinking gorge forth steemed still
That all the ayre about with smoke and stench did fill

Send forth their flames farre off to euery shyre
And warning giue , that enemies conspyre

But farre within , as in a hollow glade
Those glaring lampes were set , that made a dreadfull shade

As for great ioyance of his newcome guest
Eftsoones he gan aduance his haughtie crest

That made the Redcrosse knight nigh quake for feare
As bidding bold defiance to his foeman neare

His harder hide would neither perce , nor bight
But glauncing by forth passed forward right

And him so rudely passing by , did brush
With his long tayle , that horse and man to ground did rush

And found no place his deadly point to rest
Exceeding rage enflam 'd the furious beast

So wondrous force , from hand of liuing wight
Yet had he prou 'd the powre of many a puissant knight

The yielding aire , which nigh too feeble found
Her flitting partes , and element vnsound

At last low stouping with vnweldie sway
Snatcht vp both horse & man , to beare them quite away

To let them downe before his flightes end
As hagard hauke presuming to contend

To trusse the pray too heauie for his flight
Which comming downe to ground , does free it selfe by fight

And three mens strength vnto the stroke he layd
Wherewith the stiffe beame quaked , as affrayd

The percing steele there wrought a wound full wyde
That with the vncouth smart the Monster lowdly cryde

As they the earth would shoulder from her seat
And greedie gulfe does gape , as he would eat

To moue the world from off his stedfast henge
And boystrous battell make , each other to auenge

A gushing riuer of blacke goarie blood
That drowned all the land , whereon he stood

With bitter sense of his deepe rooted ill
That flames of fire he threw forth frÃƒÂµ his large nosethrill

Striuing to loose the knot , that fast him tyes
Himselfe in streighter bandes too rash implyes

From off the earth , with durty bloud distaynd
For that reprochfull fall right fowly he disdaynd

Vpon his crest the hardned yron fell
But his more hardned crest was armd so well

That from thenceforth he shund the like to take
But when he saw them come , he did them still forsake

And left not any marke , where it did light
As if in Adamant rocke it had bene pight

Thought with his wings to stye aboue the ground
But his late wounded wing vnseruiceable found

A flake of fire , that flashing in his beard
Him all amazd , and almost made affeard

That he could not endure so cruell cace
But thought his armes to leaue , and helmet to vnlace

So many furies and sharpe fits did haunt
When him the poysoned garment did enchaunt

Whom fyrie steele now burnt , that earst him armed
That erst him goodly arm 'd , now most of all him harmed

Death better were , death did he oft desire
But death will neuer come , when needes require

But gan his sturdie sterne about to weld
And him so strongly stroke , that to the ground him feld

From which fast trickled forth a siluer flood
Full of great vertues , and for med'cine good

Defyld those sacred waues , it rightly hot
The well of life , ne yet his vertues had forgot

It could recure , and aged long decay
Renew , as one were borne that very day

Ne can Cephise , nor Hebrus match this well
Into the same the knight backe ouerthrowen , fell

Whiles from their iournall labours they did rest
When that infernall Monster , hauing kest

Aboue his wonted pitch , with countenance fell
And clapt his yron wings , as victor he did dwell

And gan to highest God entirely pray
That feared chance from her to turne away

Her daintie limbs in her sad dreriment
But praying still did wake , and waking did lament

Out of the sea faire Titans deawy face
Vp rose the gentle virgin from her place

For she had great doubt of his safety
Since late she saw him fall before his enemy

Where he hath left his plumes all hoary gray
And deckt himselfe with feathers youthly gay

And marueiles at himselfe , still as he flies
So new this new-borne knight to battell new did rise

It were , or other new supplied knight
He , now to proue his late renewed might

That to the scull a yawning wound it made
The deadly dint his dulled senses all dismaid

Or his baptized hands now greater grew
Or other secret vertue did ensew

For till that stownd could neuer wight him harme
By subtilty , nor slight , nor might , nor mighty charme

Whom rauenous hunger did thereto constraine
Then gan he tosse aloft his stretched traine

Ne ought his sturdie strokes might stand afore
That high trees ouerthrew , and rocks in peeces tore

Ne liuing wight would haue him life behot
The mortall sting his angry needle shot

The griefe thereof him wondrous sore diseasd
Ne might his ranckling paine with patience be appeasd

And stroue to loose the farre infixed sting
Which when in vaine he tryde with struggeling

Of his huge taile he quite a sunder cleft
Fiue ioynts thereof he hewd , and but the stump him left

That all was couered with darknesse dire
Then fraught with rancour , and engorged ire

With his vneuen wings did fiercely fall
Vpon his sunne-bright shield , and gript it fast withall

Nor harder was from Cerberus greedie iaw
To plucke a bone , then from his cruell claw

And thrise in vaine to draw it did assay
It booted nought to thinke , to robbe him of his pray

And double blowes about him stoutly laid
That glauncing fire out of the yron plaid

Therewith at last he forst him to vnty
One of his grasping feete , him to defend thereby

He smot thereat with all his might and maine
That nought so wondrous puissance might sustaine

The paw yet missed not his minisht might
But hong still on the shield , as it at first was pight

Enrold in duskish smoke and brimstone blew
As burning Aetna from his boyling stew

Enwrapt in coleblacke clouds and filthy smoke
That all the land with stench , and heauen with horror choke

To saue his bodie from the scorching fire
Which he from hellish entrailes did expire

His nigh forwearied feeble feet did slide
And downe he fell , with dread of shame sore terrifide

Whereof great vertues ouer all were red
For happie life to all , which thereon fed

With his almightie hand , and did it call
The tree of life , the crime of our first fathers fall

As incorrupted Nature did them sow
Till that dread Dragon all did ouerthrow

Both good and ill : O mornefull memory
That tree through one mans fault hath doen vs all to dy

And ouerflowed all the fertill plaine
As it had deawed bene with timely raine

The senselesse corse appointed for the graue
Into that same he fell : which did from death him saue

Yet he it oft aduentur 'd to inuade
By this the drouping day-light gan to fade

The face of earth , and wayes of liuing wight
And high her burning torch set vp in heauen bright

But lay as in a dreame of deepe delight
Besmeard with pretious Balme , whose vertuous might

And for his safetie gan deuoutly pray
And watch the noyous night , and wait for ioyous day

With rosie cheekes , for shame as blushing red
Her golden lockes for haste were loosely shed

From heauen high to chase the chearelesse darke
With merry note her loud salutes the mounting larke

Whose early foe awaiting him beside
To haue deuourd , so soone as day he spyde

He woxe dismayd , and gan his fate to feare
Nathlesse with wonted rage he him aduaunced neare

Who him r'encountring fierce , as hauke in flight
Perforce rebutted backe . The weapon bright

That deepe emperst his darksome hollow maw
And back retyrd , his life bloud forth with all did draw

Did grone , as feeble so great load to lift
So downe he fell , as an huge rockie clift

And rolling downe , great Neptune doth dismay
So downe he fell , and like an heaped mountaine lay

Durst not approch for dread , which she misdeemed
But yet at last , when as the direfull feend

Then God she praysd , and thankt her faithfull knight
That had atchieu 'd so great a conquest by his might

The which afore is fairely to be kend
And seemeth safe from stormes , that may offend

There eke my feeble barke a while may stay
Till merry wind and weather call her thence away

When the last deadly smoke aloft did steeme
That signe of last outbreathed life did seeme

And to his Lord and Ladie lowd gan call
To tell , how he had seene the Dragons fatall fall

Those tydings were , as he did vnderstand
Which whenas true by tryall he out fond

Proclaymed ioy and peace through all his state
For dead now was their foe , which them forrayed late

Gainst him , that had them long opprest with tort
And fast imprisoned in sieged fort

Reioycing at the fall of that great beast
From whose eternall bondage now they were releast

A noble crew about them waited round
Of sage and sober Peres , all grauely gownd

But now they laurell braunches bore in hand
Glad signe of victorie and peace in all their land

And at his feet their laurell boughes did throw
Soone after them all dauncing on a row

When morning deaw vpon their leaues doth light
And in their hands sweet Timbrels all vpheld on hight

In well attuned notes , a ioyous lay
And made delightfull musicke all the way

Beholds her Nymphes , enraung 'd in shadie wood
Some wrestle , some do run , some bathe in christall flood

And her ador 'd by honorable name
Lifting to heauen her euerlasting fame

Who in her selfe-resemblance well beseene
Did seeme such , as she was , a goodly maiden Queene

Whom all admired , as from heauen sent
And gazd vpon with gaping wonderment

The sight with idle feare did them dismay
Ne durst approch him nigh , to touch , or once assay

Some lingring life within his hollow brest
Or in his wombe might lurke some hidden nest

Yet sparckling fire , and bad thereof take heed
Another said , he saw him moue his eyes indeed

And to her gossips gan in counsell say
How can I tell , but that his talants may

Whiles some more bold , to measure him nigh stand
To proue how many acres he did spread of land

After his foes defeasance did remaine
Him goodly greetes , and faire does entertaine

Then when his daughter deare he does behold
Her dearely doth imbrace , and kisseth manifold

And with their garments strowes the paued street
Whence mounting vp , they find purueyance meet

Bespred with costly scarlot of great name
On which they lowly sit , and fitting purpose frame

Of comely seruices , or courtly trayne
My narrow leaues can not in them containe

For th'antique world excesse and pride did hate
Such proud luxurious pompe is swollen vp but late

Of straunge aduentures , and of perils sad
Which in his trauell him befallen had

From point to point , as is before exprest
Discourst his voyage long , according his request

That oft they did lament his lucklesse state
And often blame the too importune fate

So tossed was in fortunes cruell freakes
And all the while salt teares bedeawd the hearers cheaks

That I note , whether prayse , or pitty more
For neuer liuing man , I weene , so sore

And well arriued are , ( high God be blest
Let vs deuize of ease and euerlasting rest

I bounden am streight after this emprize
As that your daughter can ye well aduize

Gainst that proud Paynim king , that workes her teene
Therefore I ought craue pardon , till I there haue beene

Ne I against the same can iustly preace
But since that band ye can not now release

Ye then shall hither backe returne againe
The marriage to accomplish vowd betwixt you twain

And him in hardy battaile ouercame
Should haue mine onely daughter to his Dame

By dew desert of noble cheualree
Both daughter and eke kingdome , lo I yield to thee

Who forth proceeding with sad sober cheare
As bright as doth the morning starre appeare

And to the world does bring long wished light
So faire and fresh that Lady shewd her selfe in sight

Wherewith her heauenly beautie she did hide
Whiles on her wearie iourney she did ride

That seemd like silke and siluer wouen neare
But neither silke nor siluer therein did appeare

My ragged rimes are all too rude and bace
Her heauenly lineaments for to enchace

Did wonder much at her celestiall sight
Oft had he seene her faire , but neuer so faire dight

And added grace vnto her excellence
Who with great wisedome , and graue eloquence

Came running in , much like a man dismaid
A Messenger with letters , which his message said

But he for nought would stay his passage right
Till fast before the king he did alight

Then to his hands that writ he did betake
Which he disclosing , red thus , as the paper spake

Of that great Emperour of all the West
And bids thee be aduized for the best

For he already plighted his right hand
Vnto another loue , and to another land

False erraunt knight , infamous , and forswore
Witnesse the burning Altars , which he swore

Yet I to them for iudgement iust do fly
And them coniure t'auenge this shamefull iniury

From knitting league with him , I you aread
Ne weene my right with strength adowne to tread

And shall find friends , if need requireth soe
So bids thee well to fare , Thy neither friend , nor foe , Fidessa

As in great muse , ne word to creature spake
At last his solemne silence thus he brake

Thy life and honour late aduenturest
Let nought be hid from me , that ought to be exprest

Here heaped vp with termes of loue vnkind
My conscience cleare with guilty bands would bind

Or wrapped be in loues of former Dame
With crime do not it couer , but disclose the same

What woman , and wherefore doth me vpbrayd
With breach of loue , and loyalty betrayd

Out of my way , through perils straunge and hard
That day should faile me , ere I had them all declard

Most false Duessa , royall richly dight
That easie was t'inuegle weaker sight

Vnwares me wrought vnto her wicked will
And to my foe betrayd , when least I feared ill

O pardon me , my soueraigne Lord , to show
The secret treasons , which of late I know

This gentle knight into so great distresse
That death him did awaite in dayly wretchednesse

By breaking of the band betwixt vs twaine
Wherein she vsed hath the practicke paine

Ye shall him Archimago find , I ghesse
The falsest man aliue ; who tries shall find no lesse

Eftsoones the Gard , which on his state did wait
Attacht that faitor false , and bound him strait

With idle force did faine them to withstand
And often semblaunce made to scape out of their hand

Who then would thinke , that by his subtile trains
He could escape fowle death or deadly paines

And to the knight his daughter deare he tyde
With sacred rites and vowes for euer to abyde

The housling fire did kindle and prouide
And holy water thereon sprinckled wide

Where it should not be quenched day nor night
For feare of euill fates , but burnen euer bright

And precious odours fetcht from far away
That all the house did sweat with great aray

To driue away the dull Melancholy
The whiles one sung a song of loue and iollity

Singing before th'eternall maiesty
In their trinall triplicities on hye

Himselfe thereby reft of his sences meet
And rauished with rare impression in his sprite

Suffice it heare by signes to vnderstand
The vsuall ioyes at knitting of loues band

And euer , when his eye did her behold
His heart did seeme to melt in pleasures manifold

His deare delights were able to annoy
Yet swimming in that sea of blisfull ioy

Vnto his Farie Queene backe to returne
The which he shortly did , and Vna left to mourne

And light this wearie vessell of her lode
Here she a while may make her safe abode

On the long voyage whereto she is bent
Well may she speede and fairely finish her intent

How shall we search Thee in a battle gained
Or a weak argument by force maintained

In dagger contests , and th'artillery of words
( For swords are madmen 's tongues , and tongues are madmen 's swords

Contrived to tire all patience out
And not to satisfy the doubt

For this inferior world is but Heaven 's dusky shade
By dark reverted rays from its reflection made

Whence the weak shapes wild and imperfect pass
Like sunbeams shot at too far distance from a glass

Which all the mimic forms express
Though in strange uncouth postures , and uncomely dress

The figures all inverted show
And colours of a faded hue

Here a pale shape with upward footstep treads
And men seem walking on their heads

There whole herds suspended lie
Ready to tumble down into the sky

Such are the ways ill-guided mortals go
To judge of things above by things below

Disjointing shapes as in the fairy land of dreams
Or images that sink in streams

No wonder , then , we talk amiss
Of truth , and what , or where it is

Say , Muse , for thou , if any , know'st
Since the bright essence fled , where haunts the reverend ghost

If all that our weak knowledge titles virtue , be
( High Truth ) the best resemblance of exalted Thee

Be not the brightest pattern earth can show
Of heaven-born Truth below

Following opinion , dark and blind
That vagrant leader of the mind

And some , to be large ciphers in a state
Pleased with an empty swelling to be counted great

Rapt through the wide expanse of thought
And oft in contradiction 's vortex caught

Errors like this did old astronomers misguide
Led blindly on by gross philosophy and pride

Who , like hard masters , taught the sun
Through many a heedless sphere to run

Many an eccentric and unthrifty motion make
And thousand incoherent journeys take

Whilst all th'advantage by it got
Was but to light earth 's inconsiderable spot

Hung loosely on the church 's pinnacle
Believe it firm , because perhaps the day is mild and still

By gazing upward giddy grow
And think the church itself does so

Thus fools , for being strong and num'rous known
Suppose the truth , like all the world , their own

And holy Sancroft 's motion quite irregular appears
Because 't is opposite to theirs

In vain then would the Muse the multitude advise
Whose peevish knowledge thus perversely lies

And some kind power for once dispense
Through the dark mass , the dawn of so much sense

The muse and I no more revenge desire
Each line shall stab , shall blast , like daggers and like fire

( Say , hapless isle , although
It is a bloody list we know

Sin and the plague ever abound
In governments too easy , and too fruitful ground

Evils which a too gentle king
Too flourishing a spring

Our British soil is over rank , and breeds
Among the noblest flowers a thousand pois'nous weeds

And every stinking weed so lofty grows
As if 'twould overshade the Royal Rose

The Royal Rose , the glory of our morn
But , ah ! too much without a thorn

Alas , the occasions are so few
None e'er but you

With heavenly peace of mind to bear
( Free from our tyrant passions , anger , scorn , or fear

The giddy turns of popular rage
And all the contradictions of a poison 'd age

The Son of God pronounced by the same breath
Which straight pronounced his death

But zeal is weak and ignorant , though wondrous proud
Though very turbulent and very loud

The crazy composition shows
Like that fantastic medley in the idol 's toes

This crumbles into dust
That moulders into rust

Nothing is fix 'd that mortals see or know
Unless , perhaps , some stars above be so

And those , alas , do show
Like all transcendent excellence below

In both , false mediums cheat our sight
And far exalted objects lessen by their height

Thus primitive Sancroft moves too high
To be observed by vulgar eye

And rolls the silent year
On his own secret regular sphere

Necessity , thou tyrant conscience of the great
Say , why the church is still led blindfold by the state

Why should the first be ruin 'd and laid waste
To mend dilapidations in the last

And yet the world , whose eyes are on our mighty Prince
Thinks Heaven has cancell 'd all our sins

Follow the model close , for so I 'm sure they should
But wicked kings draw more examples than the good

Finding the mitre almost grown
A load as heavy as the crown

Swept up whole churches as it list
Wrapp 'd in a whirlwind and a mist

Such were the storms good Sancroft long has borne
The mitre , which his sacred head has worn

Death 's sting is swallow 'd up in victory at last
The bitter cup is from him past

Though blasts from contrariety of winds
Yet to firm heavenly minds

And even the sharpest eye that has the prospect seen
Confesses ignorance to judge between

And must to human reasoning opposite conclude
To point out which is moderation , which is fortitude

Thus Sancroft , in the exaltation of retreat
Shows lustre that was shaded in his seat

Short glimm'rings of the prelate glorified
Which the disguise of greatness only served to hide

Why should the Sun , alas ! be proud
To lodge behind a golden cloud

Though fringed with evening gold the cloud appears so gay
'T is but a low-born vapour kindled by a ray

At length 't is overblown and past
Puff 'd by the people 's spiteful blast

The dazzling glory dims their prostituted sight
No deflower 'd eye can face the naked light

Yet does this high perfection well proceed
From strength of its own native seed

This wilderness , the world , like that poetic wood of old
Bears one , and but one branch of gold

Where the bless 'd spirit lodges like the dove
And which ( to heavenly soil transplanted ) will improve

There are degrees above , I know
As well as here below

Where high patrician souls , dress 'd heavenly gay
Sit clad in lawn of purer woven day

There some high-spirited throne to Sancroft shall be given
In the metropolis of Heaven

Chief of the mitred saints , and from archprelate here
Translated to archangel there

Since , happy saint , since it has been of late
Either our blindness or our fate

To lose the providence of thy cares
Pity a miserable church 's tears

Some angel , say , what were the nation 's crimes
That sent these wild reformers to our times

To tear religion 's lovely face
Strip her of every ornament and grace

Religion now does on her death-bed lie
Heart-sick of a high fever and consuming atrophy

How the physicians swarm to show their mortal skill
And by their college arts methodically kill

Reformers and physicians differ but in name
One end in both , and the design the same

Cordials are in their talk , while all they mean
Is but the patient 's death , and gain

Check in thy satire , angry Muse
Or a more worthy subject choose

Let not the outcasts of an outcast age
Provoke the honour of my Muse 's rage

Nor be thy mighty spirit raised
Since Heaven and Cato both are pleased

And thus undoubtedly 'twill fare
With what unhappy men shall dare

To be successors to these great unknown
On learning 's high-establish 'd throne

Censure , and Pedantry , and Pride
Numberless nations , stretching far and wide

Shall ( I foresee it ) soon with Gothic swarms come forth
From Ignorance 's universal North

And to all future mankind shew
How strange a paradox is true

That men who lived and died without a name
Are the chief heroes in the sacred lists of fame

Thrice , with a prophet 's voice , and prophet 's power
The Muse was called in a poetic hour

And insolently thrice the slighted maid
Dared to suspend her unregarded aid

Then with that grief we form in spirits divine
Pleads for her own neglect , and thus reproaches mine

Once highly honoured ! false is the pretence
You make to truth , retreat , and innocence

Who , to pollute my shades , bring'st with thee down
The most ungenerous vices of the town

Ne'er sprung a youth from out this isle before
I once esteem 'd , and loved , and favour 'd more

Nor ever maid endured such courtlike scorn
So much in mode , so very city-born

'T is with a foul design the Muse you send
Like a cast mistress , to your wicked friend

But find some new address , some fresh deceit
Nor practise such an antiquated cheat

These are the beaten methods of the stews
Stale forms , of course , all mean deceivers use

Who barbarously think to 'scape reproach
By prostituting her they first debauch

Thus did the Muse severe unkindly blame
This offering long design 'd to Congreve 's fame

First chid the zeal as unpoetic fire
Which soon his merit forced her to inspire

Then call this verse , that speaks her largest aid
The greatest compliment she ever made

And wisely judge , no power beneath divine
Could leap the bounds which part your world and mine

For , youth , believe , to you unseen , is fixed
A mighty gulf , unpassable betwixt

Nor tax the goddess of a mean design
To praise your parts by publishing of mine

That be my thought when some large bulky writ
Shows in the front the ambition of my wit

There to surmount what bears me up , and sing
Like the victorious wren perch 'd on the eagle 's wing

This could I do , and proudly o'er him tower
Were my desires but heighten 'd to my power

Godlike the force of my young Congreve 's bays
Softening the Muse 's thunder into praise

Sent to assist an old unvanquish 'd pride
That looks with scorn on half mankind beside

A pride that well suspends poor mortals ' fate
Gets between them and my resentment 's weight

Stands in the gap 'twixt me and wretched men
T'avert th'impending judgments of my pen

Thus I look down with mercy on the age
By hopes my Congreve will reform the stage

For never did poetic mind before
Produce a richer vein , or cleaner ore

The bullion stamp 'd in your refining mind
Serves by retail to furnish half mankind

With indignation I behold your wit
Forced on me , crack 'd , and clipp 'd , and counterfeit

By vile pretenders , who a stock maintain
From broken scraps and filings of your brain

Through native dross your share is hardly known
And by short views mistook for all their own

So small the gains those from your wit do reap
Who blend it into folly 's larger heap

Like the sun 's scatter 'd beams which loosely pass
When some rough hand breaks the assembling glass

Yet want your critics no just cause to rail
Since knaves are ne'er obliged for what they steal

These pad on wit 's high road , and suits maintain
With those they rob , by what their trade does gain

Thus censure seems that fiery froth which breeds
O'er the sun 's face , and from his heat proceeds

Crusts o'er the day , shadowing its partent beam
As ancient nature 's modern masters dream

This bids some curious praters here below
Call Titan sick , because their sight is so

And well , methinks , does this allusion fit
To scribblers , and the god of light and wit

Those who by wild delusions entertain
A lust of rhyming for a poet 's vein

Raise envy 's clouds to leave themselves in night
But can no more obscure my Congreve 's light

Than swarms of gnats , that wanton in a ray
Which gave them birth , can rob the world of day

What northern hive pour 'd out these foes to wit
Whence came these Goths to overrun the pit

How would you blush the shameful birth to hear
Of those you so ignobly stoop to fear

For , ill to them , long have I travell 'd since
Round all the circles of impertinence

Search 'd in the nest where every worm did lie
Before it grew a city butterfly

I 'm sure I found them other kind of things
Than those with backs of silk and golden wings

A search , no doubt , as curious and as wise
As virtuosoes ' in dissecting flies

For , could you think ? the fiercest foes you dread
And court in prologues , all are country bred

Bred in my scene , and for the poet 's sins
Adjourn 'd from tops and grammar to the inns

Those beds of dung , where schoolboys sprout up beaux
Far sooner than the nobler mushroom grows

These are the lords of the poetic schools
Who preach the saucy pedantry of rules

Those powers the critics , who may boast the odds
O'er Nile , with all its wilderness of gods

Nor could the nations kneel to viler shapes
Which worshipp 'd cats , and sacrificed to apes

And can you think the wise forbear to laugh
At the warm zeal that breeds this golden calf

Haply you judge these lines severely writ
Against the proud usurpers of the pit

Stay while I tell my story , short , and true
To draw conclusions shall be left to you

Nor need I ramble far to force a rule
But lay the scene just here at Farnham school

Last year , a lad hence by his parents sent
With other cattle to the city went

Where having cast his coat , and well pursued
The methods most in fashion to be lewd

Return 'd a finish 'd spark this summer down
Stock 'd with the freshest gibberish of the town

A jargon form 'd from the lost language , wit
Confounded in that Babel of the pit

Form 'd by diseased conceptions , weak and wild
Sick lust of souls , and an abortive child

Born between whores and fops , by lewd compacts
Before the play , or else between the acts

Nor wonder , if from such polluted minds
Should spring such short and transitory kinds

Or crazy rules to make us wits by rote
Last just as long as every cuckoo 's note

What bungling , rusty tools are used by fate
'T was in an evil hour to urge my hate

My hate , whose lash just Heaven has long decreed
Shall on a day make sin and folly bleed

When man 's ill genius to my presence sent
This wretch , to rouse my wrath , for ruin meant

Who in his idiom vile , with Gray's-Inn grace
Squander 'd his noisy talents to my face

Named every player on his fingers ' ends
Swore all the wits were his peculiar friends

Talk 'd with that saucy and familiar ease
Of Wycherly , and you , and Mr. Bayes

Said , how a late report your friends had vexed
Who heard you meant to write heroics next

For , tragedy , he knew , would lose you quite
And told you so at Will 's but t'other night

Thus are the lives of fools a sort of dreams
Rendering shades things , and substances of names

Such high companions may delusion keep
Lords are a footboy 's cronies in his sleep

As a fresh miss , by fancy , face , and gown
Render 'd the topping beauty of the town

Draws every rhyming , prating , dressing sot
To boast of favours that he never got

Of which , whoe'er lacks confidence to prate
Brings his good parts and breeding in debate

And not the meanest coxcomb you can find
But thanks his stars , that Phillis has been kind

Thus prostitute my Congreve 's name is grown
To every lewd pretender of the town

Troth , I could pity you ; but this is it
You find , to be the fashionable wit

These are the slaves whom reputation chains
Whose maintenance requires no help from brains

For , should the vilest scribbler to the pit
Whom sin and want e'er furnish 'd out a wit

Whose name must not within my lines be shown
Lest here it live , when perish 'd with his own

Should such a wretch usurp my Congreve 's place
And choose out wits who ne'er have seen his face

I 'll bet my life but the dull cheat would pass
Nor need the lion 's skin conceal the ass

Yes , that beau 's look , that vice , those critic ears
Must needs be right , so well resembling theirs

Perish the Muse 's hour thus vainly spent
In satire , to my Congreve 's praises meant

In how ill season her resentments rule
What 's that to her if mankind be a fool

Happy beyond a private Muse 's fate
In pleasing all that 's good among the great

Where though her elder sisters crowding throng
She still is welcome with her innocent song

Whom were my Congreve blest to see and know
What poor regards would merit all below

How proudly would he haste the joy to meet
And drop his laurel at Apollo 's feet

Here by a mountain 's side , a reverend cave
Gives murmuring passage to a lasting wave

'T is the world 's watery hour-glass streaming fast
Time is no more when th'utmost drop is past

Here , on a better day , some druid dwelt
And the young Muse 's early favour felt

Druid , a name she does with pride repeat
Confessing Albion once her darling seat

Far in this primitive cell might we pursue
Our predecessors ' footsteps still in view

Here would we sing -- But , ah ! you think I dream
And the bad world may well believe the same

Yes : you are all malicious slanders by
While two fond lovers prate , the Muse and I

Since thus I wander from my first intent
Nor am that grave adviser which I meant

Take this short lesson from the god of bays
And let my friend apply it as he please

Nor shall the bubbled virtuoso find
More than _fade_ insipid mixture left behind

While thus I write , vast shoals of critics come
And on my verse pronounce their saucy doom

The Muse like some bright country virgin shows
Fallen by mishap among a knot of beaux

They , in their lewd and fashionable prate
Rally her dress , her language , and her gait

Spend their base coin before the bashful maid
Current like copper , and as often paid

She , who on shady banks has joy 'd to sleep
Near better animals , her father 's sheep

Shamed and amazed , beholds the chattering throng
To think what cattle she is got among

But with the odious smell and sight annoyed
In haste she does th'offensive herd avoid

'T is time to bid my friend a long farewell
The muse retreats far in yon crystal cell

Faint inspiration sickens as she flies
Like distant echo spent , the spirit dies

In this descending sheet you 'll haply find
Some short refreshment for your weary mind

Nought it contains is common or unclean
And once drawn up , is ne'er let down again

Strange to conceive , how the same objects strike
At distant hours the mind with forms so like

Whether in time , Deduction 's broken chain
Meets , and salutes her sister link again

Or haunted Fancy , by a circling flight
Comes back with joy to its own seat at night

Or whether dead Imagination 's ghost
Oft hovers where alive it haunted most

Or if Thought 's rolling globe , her circle run
Turns up old objects to the soul her sun

Or loves the Muse to walk with conscious pride
O'er the glad scene whence first she rose a bride

Be what it will ; late near yon whispering stream
Where her own Temple was her darling theme

There first the visionary sound was heard
When to poetic view the Muse appeared

Such seem 'd her eyes , as when an evening ray
Gives glad farewell to a tempestuous day

Weak is the beam to dry up Nature 's tears
Still every tree the pendent sorrow wears

Such are the smiles where drops of crystal show
Approaching joy at strife with parting woe

As when , to scare th'ungrateful or the proud
Tempests long frown , and thunder threatens loud

Till the blest sun , to give kind dawn of grace
Darts weeping beams across Heaven 's watery face

When soon the peaceful bow unstring 'd is shown
A sign God 's dart is shot , and wrath o'erblown

Such to unhallow 'd sight the Muse divine
Might seem , when first she raised her eyes to mine

What mortal change does in thy face appear
Lost youth , she cried , since first I met thee here

With how undecent clouds are overcast
Thy looks , when every cause of grief is past

Unworthy the glad tidings which I bring
Listen while the Muse thus teaches thee to sing

As parent earth , burst by imprison 'd winds
Scatters strange agues o'er men 's sickly minds

And shakes the atheist 's knees ; such ghastly fear
Late I beheld on every face appear

Mild Dorothea , peaceful , wise , and great
Trembling beheld the doubtful hand of fate

Mild Dorothea , whom we both have long
Not dared to injure with our lowly song

Sprung from a better world , and chosen then
The best companion for the best of men

As some fair pile , yet spared by zeal and rage
Lives pious witness of a better age

So men may see what once was womankind
In the fair shrine of Dorothea 's mind

You that would grief describe , come here and trace
Its watery footsteps in Dorinda 's face

Grief from Dorinda 's face does ne'er depart
Farther than its own palace in her heart

Ah , since our fears are fled , this insolent expel
At least confine the tyrant to his cell

And if so black the cloud that Heaven 's bright queen
Shrouds her still beams ; how should the stars be seen

Thus when Dorinda wept , joy every face forsook
And grief flung sables on each menial look

The humble tribe mourn 'd for the quick'ning soul
That furnish 'd spirit and motion through the whole

So would earth 's face turn pale , and life decay
Should Heaven suspend to act but for a day

So nature 's crazed convulsions make us dread
That time is sick , or the world 's mind is dead.

Take , youth , these thoughts , large matter to employ
The fancy furnish 'd by returning joy

And to mistaken man these truths rehearse
Who dare revile the integrity of verse

Ah , favourite youth , how happy is thy lot
But I 'm deceived , or thou regard'st me not

Speak , for I wait thy answer , and expect
Thy just submission for this bold neglect

Unknown the forms we the high-priesthood use
At the divine appearance of the Muse

Which to divulge might shake profane belief
And tell the irreligion of my grief

Grief that excused the tribute of my knees
And shaped my passion in such words as these

Malignant goddess ! bane to my repose
Thou universal cause of all my woes

Say whence it comes that thou art grown of late
A poor amusement for my scorn and hate

The malice thou inspirest I never fail
On thee to wreak the tribute when I rail

Fool 's commonplace thou art , their weak ensconcing fort
Th'appeal of dulness in the last resort

Heaven , with a parent 's eye regarding earth
Deals out to man the planet of his birth

But sees thy meteor blaze about me shine
And passing o'er , mistakes thee still for mine

Ah , should I tell a secret yet unknown
That thou ne'er hadst a being of thy own

But a wild form dependent on the brain
Scattering loose features o'er the optic vein

Troubling the crystal fountain of the sight
Which darts on poets ' eyes a trembling light

Kindled while reason sleeps , but quickly flies
Like antic shapes in dreams , from waking eyes

In sum , a glitt'ring voice , a painted name
A walking vapour , like thy sister fame

But if thou be'st what thy mad votaries prate
A female power , loose govern 'd thoughts create

Why near the dregs of youth perversely wilt thou stay
So highly courted by the brisk and gay

Wert thou right woman , thou should'st scorn to look
On an abandon 'd wretch by hopes forsook

Forsook by hopes , ill fortune 's last relief
Assign 'd for life to unremitting grief

For , let Heaven 's wrath enlarge these weary days
If hope e'er dawns the smallest of its rays

Time o'er the happy takes so swift a flight
And treads so soft , so easy , and so light

That we the wretched , creeping far behind
Can scarce th'impression of his footsteps find

Smooth as that airy nymph so subtly born
With inoffensive feet o'er standing corn

Which bow 'd by evening breeze with bending stalks
Salutes the weary traveller as he walks

But o'er the afflicted with a heavy pace
Sweeps the broad scythe , and tramples on his face

Down falls the summer 's pride , and sadly shows
Nature 's bare visage furrow 'd as he mows

See , Muse , what havoc in these looks appear
These are the tyrant 's trophies of a year

Since hope his last and greatest foe is fled
Despair and he lodge ever in its stead

March o'er the ruin 'd plain with motion slow
Still scattering desolation where they go

To thee I owe that fatal bent of mind
Still to unhappy restless thoughts inclined

To thee , what oft I vainly strive to hide
That scorn of fools , by fools mistook for pride

From thee whatever virtue takes its rise
Grows a misfortune , or becomes a vice

Such were thy rules to be poetically great
`` Stoop not to interest , flattery , or deceit

Nor with hired thoughts be thy devotion paid
Learn to disdain their mercenary aid

Be this thy sure defence , thy brazen wall
Know no base action , at no guilt turn pale

And since unhappy distance thus denies
T'expose thy soul , clad in this poor disguise

Since thy few ill-presented graces seem
To breed contempt where thou hast hoped esteem

Madness like this no fancy ever seized
Still to be cheated , never to be pleased

Since one false beam of joy in sickly minds
Is all the poor content delusion finds.

There thy enchantment broke , and from this hour
I here renounce thy visionary power

And since thy essence on my breath depends
Thus with a puff the whole delusion ends

Peruse my leaves thro ' ev'ry part
And think thou seest my owner 's heart

Scrawl 'd o'er with trifles thus , and quite
As hard , as senseless , and as light

Expos 'd to ev'ry coxcomb 's eyes
But hid with caution from the wise

Here you may read , `` Dear charming saint
Beneath , `` A new receipt for paint

Here , in beau-spelling , `` Tru tel deth
There , in her own , `` For an el breth

Here , `` Lovely nymph , pronounce my doom
There , `` A safe way to use perfume

Here , a page fill 'd with billets-doux
On t'other side , `` Laid out for shoes

`` Madam , I die without your grace
`` Item , for half a yard of lace

Who that had wit would place it here
For ev'ry peeping fop to jeer

To think that your brains ' issue is
Exposed to th'excrement of his

In pow ' r of spittle and a clout
Whene'er he please , to blot it out

And then , to heighten the disgrace
Clap his own nonsense in the place

Whoe'er expects to hold his part
In such a book , and such a heart

If he be wealthy , and a fool
Is in all points the fittest tool

Of whom it may be justly said
He 's a gold pencil tipp 'd with lead

Then all in the place
He left a void space

When behold the next morning a wonderful riddle
He found it was strangely fill 'd up in the middle

CHO . Let censuring critics then think what they list o n't
Who would not write verses with such an assistant

Yet he did not know
If it were friend or foe

Howe'er , it was civil , in angel or elf
For he ne'er could have fill 'd it so well of himself

Then , good Doctor Swift
Pay thanks for the gift

And , though some malicious young spirit did do't
You may know by the hand it had no cloven foot

Did ever problem thus perplex
Or more employ the female sex

So sweet a passion who would think
Jove ever form 'd to make a stink

The ladies vow and swear , they 'll try
Whether it be a truth or lie

Love 's fire , it seems , like inward heat
Works in my lord by stool and sweat

Which brings a stink from every pore
And from behind and from before

Yet what is wonderful to tell it
None but the favourite nymph can smell it

But now , to solve the natural cause
By sober philosophic laws

Whether all passions , when in ferment
Work out as anger does in vermin

So , when a weasel you torment
You find his passion by his scent

We read of kings , who , in a fright
Though on a throne , would fall to shite

Beside all this , deep scholars know
That the main string of Cupid 's bow

Once on a time was an a -- gut
Now to a nobler office put

By favour or desert preferred
From giving passage to a t

But still , though fix 'd among the stars
Does sympathize with human a

Thus , when you feel a hard-bound breech
Conclude love 's bow-string at full stretch

Till the kind looseness comes , and then
Conclude the bow relax 'd again

And now , the ladies all are bent
To try the great experiment

Ambitious of a regent 's heart
Spread all their charms to catch a fart

Watching the first unsavoury wind
Some ply before , and some behind

My lord , on fire amid the dames
F -- ts like a laurel in the flames

The fair approach the speaking part
To try the back-way to his heart

For , as when we a gun discharge
Although the bore be none so large

Before the flame from muzzle burst
Just at the breech it flashes first

So from my lord his passion broke
He f -- d first and then he spoke

The ladies vanish in the smother
To confer notes with one another

And now they all agreed to name
Whom each one thought the happy dame

Quoth Neal , whate'er the rest may think
I 'm sure 't was I that smelt the stink

You smell the stink ! by G -- d , you lie
Quoth Ross , for I 'll be sworn 't was I

Ladies , quoth Levens , pray forbear
Let 's not fall out ; we all had share

And , by the most I can discover
My lord 's a universal lover

As mastiff dogs , in modern phrase , are
Call 'd _Pompey , Scipio_ , and _Caesar

As pies and daws are often styled
With Christian nicknames , like a child

As we say _Monsieur_ to an ape
Without offence to human shape

So men have got , from bird and brute
Names that would best their nature suit

The _Lion , Eagle , Fox_ , and _Boar_
Were heroes ' titles heretofore

Bestow 'd as hi'roglyphics fit
To show their valour , strength , or wit

For what is understood by _fame_
Besides the getting of a _name

But , e'er since men invented guns
A diff'rent way their fancy runs

To paint a hero , we inquire
For something that will conquer _fire._

Would you describe _Turenne_ or _Trump
Think of a _bucket_ or a _pump._

Are these too low ? -- then find out grander
Call my LORD CUTTS a _Salamander._

'T is well ; -- but since we live among
Detractors with an evil tongue

Who may object against the term
Pliny shall prove what we affirm

Pliny shall prove , and we 'll apply
And I 'll be judg 'd by standers by

First , then , our author has defined
This reptile of the serpent kind

With gaudy coat , and shining train
But loathsome spots his body stain

Out from some hole obscure he flies
When rains descend , and tempests rise

Till the sun clears the air ; and then
Crawls back neglected to his den

So , when the war has raised a storm
I 've seen a snake in human form

All stain 'd with infamy and vice
Leap from the dunghill in a trice

Burnish and make a gaudy show
Become a general , peer , and beau

Till peace has made the sky serene
Then shrink into its hole again

`` All this we grant -- why then , look yonder
Sure that must be a Salamander

Further , we are by Pliny told
This serpent is extremely cold

So cold , that , put it in the fire
'Twill make the very flames expire

Besides , it spues a filthy froth
( Whether thro ' rage or lust or both

Of matter purulent and white
Which , happening on the skin to light

And there corrupting to a wound
Spreads leprosy and baldness round

So have I seen a batter 'd beau
By age and claps grown cold as snow

Whose breath or touch , where'er he came
Blew out love 's torch , or chill 'd the flame

And should some nymph , who ne'er was cruel
Like Carleton cheap , or famed Du-Ruel

Receive the filth which he ejects
She soon would find the same effects

Her tainted carcass to pursue
As from the Salamander 's spue

A dismal shedding of her locks
And , if no leprosy , a pox

`` Then I 'll appeal to each bystander
If this be not a Salamander

Mordanto fills the trump of fame
The Christian world his deeds proclaim

In journeys he outrides the post
Sits up till midnight with his host

Knows every prince in Europe 's face
Flies like a squib from place to place

From Paris gazette Ãƒ -la-main
This day arriv 'd , without his train

A messenger comes all a-reek
Mordanto at Madrid to seek

Next day the post-boy winds his horn
And rides through Dover in the morn

Mordanto gallops on alone
The roads are with his followers strewn

His body active as his mind
Returning sound in limb and wind

A skeleton in outward figure
His meagre corps , though full of vigour

So wonderful his expedition
When you have not the least suspicion

Shines in all climates like a star
In senates bold , and fierce in war

Heroic actions early bred in
Ne'er to be match 'd in modern reading

The queen has lately lost a part
Of her ENTIRELY-ENGLISH heart

For want of which , by way of botch
She pieced it up again with SCOTCH

Blest revolution ! which creates
Divided hearts , united states

See how the double nation lies
Like a rich coat with skirts of frize

As if a man , in making posies
Should bundle thistles up with roses

Who ever yet a union saw
Of kingdoms without faith or law

Henceforward let no statesman dare
A kingdom to a ship compare

Lest he should call our commonweal
A vessel with a double keel

Which , just like ours , new rigg 'd and manned
And got about a league from land

By change of wind to leeward side
The pilot knew not how to guide

So tossing faction will o'erwhelm
Our crazy double-bottom 'd realm

When Cupid did his grandsire Jove entreat
To form some Beauty by a new receipt

Jove sent , and found , far in a country scene
Truth , innocence , good nature , look serene

From which ingredients first the dext'rous boy
Pick 'd the demure , the awkward , and the coy

The Graces from the court did next provide
Breeding , and wit , and air , and decent pride

These Venus cleans 'd from ev'ry spurious grain
Of nice coquet , affected , pert , and vain

Jove mix 'd up all , and the best clay employed
Then call 'd the happy composition FLOYD

Venus one day , as story goes
But for what reason no man knows

In sullen mood and grave deport
Trudged it away to Jove 's high court

And there his Godship did entreat
To look out for his best receipt

And make a monster strange and odd
Abhorr 'd by man and every god

Jove , ever kind to all the fair
Nor e'er refused a lady 's prayer

Straight oped 'scrutoire , and forth he took
A neatly bound and well-gilt book

Sure sign that nothing enter 'd there
But what was very choice and rare

Scarce had he turn 'd a page or two
It might be more , for aught I knew

But , be the matter more or less
'Mong friends 'twill break no squares , I guess

Then , smiling , to the dame quoth he
Here 's one will fit you to a T

But , as the writing doth prescribe
'T is fit the ingredients we provide

Away he went , and search 'd the stews
And every street about the Mews

Diseases , impudence , and lies
Are found and brought him in a trice

From Hackney then he did provide
A clumsy air and awkward pride

From lady 's toilet next he brought
Noise , scandal , and malicious thought

These Jove put in an old close-stool
And with them mix 'd the vain , the fool

But now came on his greatest care
Of what he should his paste prepare

For common clay or finer mould
Was much too good , such stuff to hold

At last he wisely thought on mud
So raised it up , and call 'd it -- _Cludd._

With this , the lady well content
Low curtsey 'd , and away she went

In times of old , when Time was young
And poets their own verses sung

A verse would draw a stone or beam
That now would overload a team

Lead 'em a dance of many a mile
Then rear 'em to a goodly pile

Each number had its diff'rent power
Heroic strains could build a tower

Sonnets and elegies to Chloris
Might raise a house about two stories

A lyric ode would slate ; a catch
Would tile ; an epigram would thatch

Now Poets feel this art is lost
Both to their own and landlord 's cost

Not one of all the tuneful throng
Can hire a lodging for a song

For Jove consider 'd well the case
That poets were a numerous race

And if they all had power to build
The earth would very soon be filled

Materials would be quickly spent
And houses would not give a rent

The God of Wealth was therefore made
Sole patron of the building trade

Leaving to wits the spacious air
With license to build castles there

In right whereof their old pretence
To lodge in garrets comes from thence

There is a worm by Phoebus bred
By leaves of mulberry is fed

Which unprovided where to dwell
Conforms itself to weave a cell

Then curious hands this texture take
And for themselves fine garments make

Meantime a pair of awkward things
Grow to his back instead of wings

He flutters when he thinks he flies
Then sheds about his spawn and dies

Just such an insect of the age
Is he that scribbles for the stage

His birth he does from Phoebus raise
And feeds upon imagin 'd bays

Throws all his wit and hours away
In twisting up an ill spun Play

This gives him lodging and provides
A stock of tawdry shift besides

With the unravell 'd shreds of which
The under wits adorn their speech

And now he spreads his little fans
( For all the Muses Geese are Swans

And borne on Fancy 's pinions , thinks
He soars sublimest when he sinks

But scatt'ring round his fly-blows , dies
Whence broods of insect-poets rise

Premising thus , in modern way
The greater part I have to say

Sing , Muse , the house of Poet Van
In higher strain than we began

Van ( for 't is fit the reader know it
Is both a Herald and a Poet

No wonder then if nicely skilled
In each capacity to build

As Herald , he can in a day
Repair a house gone to decay

Or by achievements , arms , device
Erect a new one in a trice

And poets , if they had their due
By ancient right are builders too

This made him to Apollo pray
For leave to build -- the poets way

His prayer was granted , for the God
Consented with the usual nod

After hard throes of many a day
Van was delivered of a play

Which in due time brought forth a house
Just as the mountain did the mouse

One story high , one postern door
And one small chamber on a floor

Born like a phoenix from the flame
But neither bulk nor shape the same

As animals of largest size
Corrupt to maggots , worms , and flies

A type of modern wit and style
The rubbish of an ancient pile

So chemists boast they have a power
From the dead ashes of a flower

Some faint resemblance to produce
But not the virtue , taste , nor juice

So modern rhymers strive to blast
The poetry of ages past

Which , having wisely overthrown
They from its ruins build their own

In times of old , when Time was young
And poets their own verses sung

A verse would draw a stone or beam
That now would overload a team

Lead 'em a dance of many a mile
Then rear 'em to a goodly pile

Each number had its diff'rent power
Heroic strains could build a tower

Sonnets , or elegies to Chloris
Might raise a house about two stories

A lyric ode would slate ; a catch
Would tile ; an epigram would thatch

But , to their own or landlord 's cost
Now Poets feel this art is lost

Not one of all our tuneful throng
Can raise a lodging for a song

For Jove consider 'd well the case
Observed they grew a numerous race

And should they build as fast as write
'Twould ruin undertakers quite

This evil , therefore , to prevent
He wisely changed their element

On earth the God of Wealth was made
Sole patron of the building trade

Leaving the Wits the spacious air
With license to build castles there

And 't is conceived their old pretence
To lodge in garrets comes from thence

Premising thus , in modern way
The better half we have to say

Sing , Muse , the house of Poet Van
In higher strains than we began

Van ( for 't is fit the reader know it
Is both a Herald and a Poet

No wonder then if nicely skilled
In both capacities to build

As Herald , he can in a day
Repair a house gone to decay

Or , by achievements , arms , device
Erect a new one in a trice

And as a poet , he has skill
To build in speculation still

`` Great Jove ! '' he cried , `` the art restore
To build by verse as heretofore

And make my Muse the architect
What palaces shall we erect

No longer shall forsaken Thames
Lament his old Whitehall in flames

A pile shall from its ashes rise
Fit to invade or prop the skies

Jove smiled , and , like a gentle god
Consenting with the usual nod

Told Van , he knew his talent best
And left the choice to his own breast

So Van resolved to write a farce
But , well perceiving wit was scarce

With cunning that defect supplies
Takes a French play as lawful prize

Steals thence his plot and ev'ry joke
Not once suspecting Jove would smoke

And ( like a wag set down to write
Would whisper to himself , `` a _bite_

Then , from this motley mingled style
Proceeded to erect his pile

So men of old , to gain renown , did
Build Babel with their tongues confounded

Jove saw the cheat , but thought it best
To turn the matter to a jest

Down from Olympus ' top he slides
Laughing as if he 'd burst his sides

Ay , thought the god , are these your tricks
Why then old plays deserve old bricks

And since you 're sparing of your stuff
Your building shall be small enough

He spake , and grudging , lent his aid
Th'experienced bricks , that knew their trade

( As being bricks at second hand
Now move , and now in order stand

The building , as the Poet writ
Rose in proportion to his wit

And first the prologue built a wall
So wide as to encompass all

The scene , a wood , produc 'd no more
Than a few scrubby trees before

The plot as yet lay deep ; and so
A cellar next was dug below

But this a work so hard was found
Two acts it cost him under ground

Two other acts , we may presume
Were spent in building each a room

Thus far advanc 'd , he made a shift
To raise a roof with act the fift

The epilogue behind did frame
A place , not decent here to name

Now , Poets from all quarters ran
To see the house of brother Van

Looked high and low , walk 'd often round
But no such house was to be found

One asks the watermen hard by
`` Where may the Poet 's palace lie

Another of the Thames inquires
If he has seen its gilded spires

At length they in the rubbish spy
A thing resembling a goose-pie

Thither in haste the Poets throng
And gaze in silent wonder long

Till one in raptures thus began
To praise the pile and builder Van

`` Thrice happy Poet ! who may'st trail
Thy house about thee like a snail

Or harness 'd to a nag , at ease
Take journeys in it like a chaise

Or in a boat whene'er thou wilt
Can'st make it serve thee for a tilt

Capacious house ! 't is own 'd by all
Thou'rt well contrived , tho ' thou art small

For ev'ry Wit in Britain 's isle
May lodge within thy spacious pile

Like Bacchus thou , as Poets feign
Thy mother burnt , art born again

Born like a phoenix from the flame
But neither bulk nor shape the same

As animals of largest size
Corrupt to maggots , worms , and flies

A type of modern wit and style
The rubbish of an ancient pile

So chemists boast they have a power
From the dead ashes of a flower

Some faint resemblance to produce
But not the virtue , taste , or juice

So modern rhymers wisely blast
The poetry of ages past

Which , after they have overthrown
They from its ruins build their own

In ancient time , as story tells
The saints would often leave their cells

And stroll about , but hide their quality
To try good people 's hospitality

It happen 'd on a winter 's night
As authors of the legend write

Two brother hermits , saints by trade
Taking their tour in masquerade

Came to a village hard by Rixham
Ragged and not a groat betwixt 'em

It rain 'd as hard as it could pour
Yet they were forced to walk an hour

From house to house , wet to the skin
Before one soul would let 'em in

They call 'd at every door : `` Good people
My comrade 's blind , and I 'm a creeple

Here we lie starving in the street
'Twould grieve a body 's heart to see't

No Christian would turn out a beast
In such a dreadful night at least

Give us but straw and let us lie
In yonder barn to keep us dry

Thus in the stroller 's usual cant
They begg 'd relief , which none would grant

No creature valued what they said
One family was gone to bed

The master bawled out half asleep
`` You fellows , what a noise you keep

So many beggars pass this way
We ca n't be quiet , night nor day

We can not serve you every one
Pray take your answer , and be gone

One swore he 'd send 'em to the stocks
A third could not forbear his mocks

But bawl 'd as loud as he could roar
`` You 're on the wrong side of the door

One surly clown look't out and said
`` I 'll fling the p -- pot on your head

You sha'nt come here , nor get a sous
You look like rogues would rob a house

Ca n't you go work , or serve the King
You blind and lame ! 'T is no such thing

That 's but a counterfeit sore leg
For shame ! two sturdy rascals beg

If I come down , _I'll_ spoil your trick
And cure you both with a good stick

Our wand'ring saints , in woful state
Treated at this ungodly rate

Having thro ' all the village past
To a small cottage came at last

Where dwelt a good old honest ye'man
Call 'd thereabout good man Philemon

Who kindly did the saints invite
In his poor house to pass the night

And then the hospitable sire
Bid Goody Baucis mend the fire

Whilst he from out the chimney took
A flitch of bacon off the hook

And freely from the fattest side
Cut out large slices to be fryed

Which tost up in a pan with batter
And served up in an earthen platter

Quoth Baucis , `` This is wholesome fare
Eat , honest friends , and never spare

And if we find our victuals fail
We can but make it out in ale

To a small kilderkin of beer
Brew 'd for the good time of the year

Philemon , by his wife 's consent
Stept with a jug , and made a vent

And having fill 'd it to the brink
Invited both the saints to drink

When they had took a second draught
Behold , a miracle was wrought

For , Baucis with amazement found
Although the jug had twice gone round

It still was full up to the top
As they ne'er had drunk a drop

You may be sure so strange a sight
Put the old people in a fright

Philemon whisper 'd to his wife
`` These men are -- Saints -- I 'll lay my life

The strangers overheard , and said
`` You 're in the right -- but be'nt afraid

No hurt shall come to you or yours
But for that pack of churlish boors

Not fit to live on Christian ground
They and their village shall be drowned

Whilst you shall see your cottage rise
And grow a church before your eyes

Scarce had they spoke , when fair and soft
The roof began to mount aloft

Aloft rose ev'ry beam and rafter
The heavy wall went clambering after

The chimney widen 'd , and grew higher
Became a steeple with a spire

The kettle to the top was hoist
And there stood fastened to a joist

But with the upside down , to show
Its inclination for below

In vain ; for a superior force
Applied at bottom stops its course

Doom 'd ever in suspense to dwell
'T is now no kettle , but a bell

The wooden jack , which had almost
Lost by disuse the art to roast

A sudden alteration feels
Increas 'd by new intestine wheels

But what adds to the wonder more
The number made the motion slower

The flyer , altho't had leaden feet
Would turn so quick you scarce could see't

But , now stopt by some hidden powers
Moves round but twice in twice twelve hours

While in the station of a jack
'T was never known to turn its back

A friend in turns and windings tried
Nor ever left the chimney 's side

The chimney to a steeple grown
The jack would not be left alone

But , up against the steeple reared
Became a clock , and still adhered

And still its love to household cares
By a shrill voice at noon declares

Warning the cookmaid not to burn
That roast meat , which it can not turn

The groaning-chair began to crawl
Like a huge insect , up the wall

There stuck , and to a pulpit grew
But kept its matter and its hue

And mindful of its ancient state
Still groans while tattling gossips prate

The mortar only chang 'd its name
In its old shape a font became

The porringers , that in a row
Hung high , and made a glitt'ring show

To a less noble substance changed
Were now but leathern buckets ranged

The ballads , pasted on the wall
Of Chevy Chase , and English Mall

Fair Rosamond , and Robin Hood
The little Children in the Wood

Enlarged in picture , size , and letter
And painted , lookt abundance better

And now the heraldry describe
Of a churchwarden , or a tribe

A bedstead of the antique mode
Composed of timber many a load

Such as our grandfathers did use
Was metamorphos 'd into pews

Which yet their former virtue keep
By lodging folk disposed to sleep

The cottage , with such feats as these
Grown to a church by just degrees

The holy men desired their host
To ask for what he fancied most

Philemon , having paused a while
Replied in complimental style

`` Your goodness , more than my desert
Makes you take all things in good part

You 've raised a church here in a minute
And I would fain continue in it

I 'm good for little at my days
Make me the parson if you please

He spoke , and presently he feels
His grazier 's coat reach down his heels

The sleeves new border 'd with a list
Widen 'd and gather 'd at his wrist

But , being old , continued just
As threadbare , and as full of dust

A shambling awkward gait he took
With a demure dejected look

Talk't of his offerings , tythes , and dues
Could smoke and drink and read the news

Or sell a goose at the next town
Decently hid beneath his gown

Contriv 'd to preach old sermons next
Chang 'd in the preface and the text

At christ'nings well could act his part
And had the service all by heart

Wish 'd women might have children fast
And thought whose sow had farrow 'd last

Against dissenters would repine
And stood up firm for `` right divine

Carried it to his equals higher
But most obedient to the squire

Found his head fill 'd with many a system
But classic authors , -- he ne'er mist 'em

Thus having furbish 'd up a parson
Dame Baucis next they play 'd their farce on

Instead of homespun coifs , were seen
Good pinners edg 'd with colberteen

Her petticoat , transform 'd apace
Became black satin , flounced with lace

`` Plain Goody '' would no longer down
'T was `` Madam , '' in her grogram gown

Philemon was in great surprise
And hardly could believe his eyes

Amaz 'd to see her look so prim
And she admir 'd as much at him

Thus happy in their change of life
Were several years this man and wife

When on a day , which prov 'd their last
Discoursing o'er old stories past

They went by chance , amidst their talk
To the churchyard , to take a walk

When Baucis hastily cry 'd out
`` My dear , I see your forehead sprout

`` Sprout ; '' quoth the man ; `` what 's this you tell us
I hope you do n't believe me jealous

But yet , methinks , I feel it true
And really yours is budding too

Nay , -- now I can not stir my foot
It feels as if 'twere taking root

Description would but tire my Muse
In short , they both were turn 'd to yews

Old Goodman Dobson of the Green
Remembers he the trees has seen

He 'll talk of them from noon till night
And goes with folk to show the sight

On Sundays , after evening prayer
He gathers all the parish there

Points out the place of either yew
Here Baucis , there Philemon , grew

Till once a parson of our town
To mend his barn , cut Baucis down

At which , 't is hard to be believed
How much the other tree was grieved

Grew scrubby , dy 'd a-top , was stunted
So the next parson stubb 'd and burnt it

In ancient times , as story tells
The saints would often leave their cells

It happen 'd on a winter night
As authors of the legend write

Two brother hermits , saints by trade
Taking their tour in masquerade

Disguis 'd in tatter 'd habits , went
To a small village down in Kent

Where , in the strollers ' canting strain
They begg 'd from door to door in vain

Try 'd ev'ry tone might pity win
But not a soul would let them in

Our wand'ring saints , in woful state
Treated at this ungodly rate

Then stepp 'd aside to fetch 'em drink
Fill 'd a large jug up to the brink

And saw it fairly twice go round
Yet ( what was wonderful ) they found

'T was still replenished to the top
As if they ne'er had touch 'd a drop

The good old couple were amazed
And often on each other gazed

For both were frighten 'd to the heart
And just began to cry , `` What _art_

Then softly turn 'd aside , to view
Whether the lights were burning blue

The gentle pilgrims , soon aware o n't
Told them their calling and their errand

`` Good folk , you need not be afraid
We are but saints , '' the hermits said

`` No hurt shall come to you or yours
But for that pack of churlish boors

Not fit to live on Christian ground

Then said , `` My house is grown so fine
Methinks , I still would call it mine

I 'm old , and fain would live at ease
Make me the parson if you please

He spoke , and presently he feels
His grazier 's coat fall down his heels

He sees , yet hardly can believe
About each arm a pudding sleeve

His waistcoat to a cassock grew
And both assumed a sable hue

But , being old , continued just
As threadbare , and as full of dust

His talk was now of tithes and dues

Here Baucis , there Philemon , grew

Till once a parson of our town
To mend his barn , cut Baucis down

At which , 't is hard to be believed
How much the other tree was grieved

Grew scrubby , dy 'd a-top , was stunted
So the next parson stubb 'd and burnt it

When Mother Cludd had rose from play
And call 'd to take the cards away

Van saw , but seem 'd not to regard
How Miss pick 'd every painted card

And , busy both with hand and eye
Soon rear 'd a house two stories high

Van 's genius , without thought or lecture
Is hugely turn 'd to architecture

He view 'd the edifice , and smiled
Vow 'd it was pretty for a child

It was so perfect in its kind
He kept the model in his mind

But , when he found the boys at play
And saw them dabbling in their clay

He stood behind a stall to lurk
And mark the progress of their work

With true delight observed them all
Raking up mud to build a wall

The plan he much admired , and took
The model in his table-book

Thought himself now exactly skilled
And so resolved a house to build

A real house , with rooms and stairs
Five times at least as big as theirs

Taller than Miss 's by two yards
Not a sham thing of play or cards

And so he did ; for , in a while
He built up such a monstrous pile

That no two chairmen could be found
Able to lift it from the ground

Still at Whitehall it stands in view
Just in the place where first it grew

There all the little schoolboys run
Envying to see themselves outdone

From such deep rudiments as these
Van is become , by due degrees

For building famed , and justly reckoned
At court , Vitruvius the Second

No wonder , since wise authors show
That best foundations must be low

And now the duke has wisely ta'en him
To be his architect at Blenheim

But raillery at once apart
If this rule holds in every art

Or if his grace were no more skill 'd in
The art of battering walls than building

We might expect to see next year
A mouse-trap man chief engineer

Well ; 't is as Bickerstaff has guest
Though we all took it for a jest

Partridge is dead ; nay more , he dyed
Ere he could prove the good 'squire lyed

Strange , an astrologer should die
Without one wonder in the sky

Not one of all his crony stars
To pay their duty at his hearse

No meteor , no eclipse appeared
No comet with a flaming beard

The sun hath rose and gone to bed
Just as if Partridge were not dead

Nor hid himself behind the moon
To make a dreadful night at noon

He at fit periods walks through Aries
Howe'er our earthly motion varies

And twice a-year he 'll cut th ' Equator
As if there had been no such matter

Some wits have wonder 'd what analogy
There is 'twixt cobbling and astrology

How Partridge made his optics rise
From a shoe-sole to reach the skies

A list the cobbler 's temples ties
To keep the hair out of his eyes

From whence 't is plain the diadem
That princes wear derives from them

And therefore crowns are now-a-days
Adorn 'd with golden stars and rays

Which plainly shows the near alliance
'Twixt cobbling and the planet 's science

Besides , that slow-paced sign BÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂ¶tes
As 't is miscall 'd , we know not who 't is

But Partridge ended all disputes
He knew his trade , and call 'd it _boots_

The horned moon , which heretofore
Upon their shoes the Romans wore

Whose wideness kept their toes from corns
And whence we claim our shoeing-horns

Shows how the art of cobbling bears
A near resemblance to the spheres

A scrap of parchment hung by geometry
( A great refiner in barometry

Can , like the stars , foretell the weather
And what is parchment else but leather

Which an astrologer might use
Either for almanacks or shoes

Thus Partridge , by his wit and parts
At once did practise both these arts

And as the boding owl ( or rather
The bat , because her wings are leather

Steals from her private cell by night
And flies about the candle-light

So learned Partridge could as well
Creep in the dark from leathern cell

And in his fancy fly as far
To peep upon a twinkling star

Besides , he could confound the spheres
And set the planets by the ears

To show his skill , he Mars could join
To Venus in aspect malign

Then call in Mercury for aid
And cure the wounds that Venus made

Great scholars have in Lucian read
When Philip King of Greece was dead

His soul and spirit did divide
And each part took a different side

One rose a star ; the other fell
Beneath , and mended shoes in Hell

Thus Partridge still shines in each art
The cobbling and star-gazing part

And is install 'd as good a star
As any of the Caesars are

Triumphant star ! some pity show
On cobblers militant below

Whom roguish boys , in stormy nights
Torment by pissing out their lights

Or through a chink convey their smoke
Enclosed artificers to choke

Thou , high exalted in thy sphere
May'st follow still thy calling there

To thee the Bull will lend his hide
By Phoebus newly tann 'd and dryed

For thee they Argo 's hulk will tax
And scrape her pitchy sides for wax

Then Ariadne kindly lends
Her braided hair to make thee ends

The points of Sagittarius ' dart
Turns to an awl by heavenly art

And Vulcan , wheedled by his wife
Will forge for thee a paring-knife

For want of room by Virgo 's side
She 'll strain a point , and sit astride

To take thee kindly in between
And then the Signs will be Thirteen

Here , five feet deep , lies on his back
A cobbler , starmonger , and quack

Who to the stars , in pure good will
Does to his best look upward still

Weep , all you customers that use
His pills , his almanacks , or shoes

And you that did your fortunes seek
Step to his grave but once a-week

This earth , which bears his body 's print
You 'll find has so much virtue i n't

That I durst pawn my ears , 'twill tell
Whate'er concerns you full as well

In physic , stolen goods , or love
As he himself could , when above

Now hardly here and there an hackney-coach
Appearing , show 'd the ruddy morn 's approach

Now Betty from her master 's bed had flown
And softly stole to discompose her own

The slip-shod 'prentice from his master 's door
Had pared the dirt , and sprinkled round the floor

Now Moll had whirl 'd her mop with dext'rous airs
Prepared to scrub the entry and the stairs

The youth with broomy stumps began to trace
The kennel 's edge , where wheels had worn the place

The small-coal man was heard with cadence deep
Till drown 'd in shriller notes of chimney-sweep

Duns at his lordship 's gate began to meet
And brickdust Moll had scream 'd through half the street

The turnkey now his flock returning sees
Duly let out a-nights to steal for fees

The watchful bailiffs take their silent stands
And schoolboys lag with satchels in their hands

Careful observers may foretell the hour
( By sure prognostics , ) when to dread a shower

While rain depends , the pensive cat gives o'er
Her frolics , and pursues her tail no more

Returning home at night , you 'll find the sink
Strike your offended sense with double stink

If you be wise , then , go not far to dine
You 'll spend in coach-hire more than save in wine

A coming shower your shooting corns presage
Old a-ches throb , your hollow tooth will rage

Sauntering in coffeehouse is Dulman seen
He damns the climate , and complains of spleen

Meanwhile the South , rising with dabbled wings
A sable cloud athwart the welkin flings

That swill 'd more liquor than it could contain
And , like a drunkard , gives it up again

Brisk Susan whips her linen from the rope
While the first drizzling shower is borne aslope

Such is that sprinkling which some careless quean
Flirts on you from her mop , but not so clean

You fly , invoke the gods ; then , turning , stop
To rail ; she singing , still whirls on her mop

Not yet the dust had shunn 'd the unequal strife
But , aided by the wind , fought still for life

And wafted with its foe by violent gust
'T was doubtful which was rain , and which was dust

Ah ! where must needy poet seek for aid
When dust and rain at once his coat invade

Sole coat ! where dust , cemented by the rain
Erects the nap , and leaves a cloudy stain

Now in contiguous drops the flood comes down
Threatening with deluge this _devoted_ town

To shops in crowds the daggled females fly
Pretend to cheapen goods , but nothing buy

The Templar spruce , while every spout 's abroach
Stays till 't is fair , yet seems to call a coach

The tuck'd-up sempstress walks with hasty strides
While streams run down her oil 'd umbrella 's sides

Here various kinds , by various fortunes led
Commence acquaintance underneath a shed

Triumphant Tories , and desponding Whigs
Forget their feuds , and join to save their wigs

Box 'd in a chair the beau impatient sits
While spouts run clattering o'er the roof by fits

And ever and anon with frightful din
The leather sounds ; he trembles from within

So when Troy chairmen bore the wooden steed
Pregnant with Greeks impatient to be freed

( Those bully Greeks , who , as the moderns do
Instead of paying chairmen , ran them through

Laocoon struck the outside with his spear
And each imprison 'd hero quaked for fear

Now from all parts the swelling kennels flow
And bear their trophies with them as they go

Filth of all hues and odour , seem to tell
What street they sail 'd from , by their sight and smell

They , as each torrent drives with rapid force
From Smithfield to St. Pulchre 's shape their course

And in huge confluence join 'd at Snowhill ridge
Fall from the conduit prone to Holborn bridge

Sweeping from butchers ' stalls , dung , guts , and blood
Drown 'd puppies , stinking sprats , all drench 'd in mud

Whoever pleases to inquire
Why yonder steeple wants a spire

The grey old fellow , Poet Joe
The philosophic cause will show

Once on a time a western blast
At least twelve inches overcast

Reckoning roof , weathercock , and all
Which came with a prodigious fall

And , tumbling topsy-turvy round
Lit with its bottom on the ground

For , by the laws of gravitation
It fell into its proper station

This is the little strutting pile
You see just by the churchyard stile

The walls in tumbling gave a knock
And thus the steeple got a shock

From whence the neighbouring farmer calls
The steeple , Knock ; the vicar , Walls

The vicar once a-week creeps in
Sits with his knees up to his chin

Here cons his notes , and takes a whet
Till the small ragged flock is met

A traveller , who by did pass
Observed the roof behind the grass

On tiptoe stood , and rear 'd his snout
And saw the parson creeping out

Was much surprised to see a crow
Venture to build his nest so low

A schoolboy ran unto't , and thought
The crib was down , the blackbird caught

A third , who lost his way by night
Was forced for safety to alight

And , stepping o'er the fabric roof
His horse had like to spoil his hoof

Warburton took it in his noddle
This building was design 'd a model

Or of a pigeon-house or oven
To bake one loaf , or keep one dove in

Then Mrs. Johnson gave her verdict
And every one was pleased that heard it

All that you make this stir about
Is but a still which wants a spout

The reverend Dr. Raymond guessed
More probably than all the rest

He said , but that it wanted room
It might have been a pigmy 's tomb

The doctor 's family came by
And little miss began to cry

Give me that house in my own hand
Then madam bade the chariot stand

Call 'd to the clerk , in manner mild
Pray , reach that thing here to the child

That thing , I mean , among the kale
And here 's to buy a pot of ale

The clerk said to her in a heat
What ! sell my master 's country seat

Where he comes every week from town
He would not sell it for a crown

Poh ! fellow , keep not such a pother
In half an hour thou'lt make another

Says Nancy , I can make for miss
A finer house ten times than this

The dean will give me willow sticks
And Joe my apron-full of bricks

Now the keen rigour of the winter 's o'er
No hail descends , and frost can pinch no more

While other girls confess the genial spring
And laugh aloud , or amorous ditties sing

Secure from cold , their lovely necks display
And throw each useless chafing-dish away

Why sits my Phillis discontented here
Nor feels the turn of the revolving year

Why on that brow dwell sorrow and dismay
Where Loves were wont to sport , and Smiles to play

Ah , Corydon ! survey the 'Change around
Through all the 'Change no wretch like me is found

Alas ! the day , when I , poor heedless maid
Was to your rooms in Lincoln 's Inn betrayed

Ye listening Zephyrs , that o'erheard his love
Waft the soft accents to the gods above

Alas ! the day ; for ( O , eternal shame
I sold you handkerchiefs , and lost my fame

When I forget the favour you bestowed
Red herrings shall be spawn 'd in Tyburn Road

Fleet Street , transform 'd , become a flowery green
And mass be sung where operas are seen

The wealthy cit , and the St. James 's beau
Shall change their quarters , and their joys forego

Stock-jobbing , this to Jonathan 's shall come
At the Groom Porter 's , that play off his plum

But what to me does all that love avail
If , while I doze at home o'er porter 's ale

My livelong hours in anxious cares are past
And raging hunger lays my beauty waste

On templars spruce in vain I glances throw
And with shrill voice invite them as they go

Exposed in vain my glossy ribbons shine
And unregarded wave upon the twine

The week flies round , and when my profit 's known
I hardly clear enough to change a crown

Hard fate of virtue , thus to be distrest
Thou fairest of thy trade , and far the best

As fruitmen 's stalls the summer market grace
And ruddy peaches them ; as first in place

Plumcake is seen o'er smaller pastry ware
And ice on that : so Phillis does appear

In playhouse and in Park , above the rest
Of belles mechanic , elegantly drest

And yet Crepundia , that conceited fair
Amid her toys , affects a saucy air

And views me hourly with a scornful eye
She might as well with bright Cleora vie

With this large petticoat I strive in vain
To hide my folly past , and coming pain

'T is now no secret ; she , and fifty more
Observe the symptoms I had once before

A second babe at Wapping must be placed
When I scarce bear the charges of the last

What I could raise I sent ; a pound of plums
Five shillings , and a coral for his gums

To-morrow I intend him something more
I sent a frock and pair of shoes before

However , you shall home with me to-night
Forget your cares , and revel in delight

I have in store a pint or two of wine
Some cracknels , and the remnant of a chine

And now on either side , and all around
The weighty shop-boards fall , and bars resound

Each ready sempstress slips her pattens on
And ties her hood , preparing to be gone

My pretty dear Cuz , tho ' I 've roved the town o'er
To dispatch in an hour some visits a score

Though , since first on the wheels , I 've been every day
At the 'Change , at a raffling , at church , or a play

And the fops of the town are pleased with the notion
Of calling your slave the perpetual motion

Though oft at your door I have whined [ out ] my love
As my Knight does grin his at your Lady above

Yet , ne'er before this , though I used all my care
I e'er was so happy to meet my dear Chair

And since we 're so near , like birds of a feather
Let 's e'en , as they say , set our horses together

By your awkward address , you 're that thing which should carry
With one footman behind , our lover Sir Harry

By your language , I judge , you think me a wench
He that makes love to me , must make it in French

Thou that 's drawn by two beasts , and carry'st a brute
Canst thou vainly e'er hope , I 'll answer thy suit

Though sometimes you pretend to appear with your six
No regard to their colour , their sexes you mix

Then on the grand-paw you 'd look very great
With your new-fashion 'd glasses , and nasty old seat

Thus a beau I have seen strut with a cock 'd hat
And newly rigg 'd out , with a dirty cravat

You may think that you make a figure most shining
But it 's plain that you have an old cloak for a lining

Are those double-gilt nails ? Where 's the lustre of Kerry
To set off the Knight , and to finish the Jerry

If you hope I 'll be kind , you must tell me what 's due
In George's-lane for you , ere I 'll buckle to

Why , how now , Doll Diamond , you 're very alert
Is it your French breeding has made you so pert

Because I was civil , here 's a stir with a pox
Who is it that values your -- -- or your fox

Sure 't is to her honour , he ever should bed
His bloody red hand to her bloody red head

You 're proud of your gilding ; but I tell you each nail
Is only just tinged with a rub at her tail

And although it may pass for gold on a ninny
Sure we know a Bath shilling soon from a guinea

Nay , her foretop 's a cheat ; each morn she does black it
Yet , ere it be night , it 's the same with her placket

I 'll ne'er be run down any more with your cant
Your velvet was wore before in a mant

On the back of her mother ; but now 't is much duller
The fire she carries hath changed its colour

Those creatures that draw me you never would mind
If you 'd but look on your own Pharaoh 's lean kine

They 're taken for spectres , they 're so meagre and spare
Drawn damnably low by your sorrel mare

We know how your lady was on you befriended
You 're not to be paid for 'till the lawsuit is ended

But her bond it is good , he need not to doubt
She is two or three years above being out

Could my Knight be advised , he should ne'er spend his vigour
On one he ca n't hope of e'er making _bigger_

Among the numbers who employ
Their tongues and pens to give you joy

Dear Harley ! generous youth , admit
What friendship dictates more than wit

Forgive me , when I fondly thought
( By frequent observations taught

A spirit so inform 'd as yours
Could never prosper in amours

The God of Wit , and Light , and Arts
With all acquired and natural parts

Whose harp could savage beasts enchant
Was an unfortunate gallant

Had Bacchus after Daphne reeled
The nymph had soon been brought to yield

Or , had embroider 'd Mars pursued
The nymph would ne'er have been a prude

Ten thousand footsteps , full in view
Mark out the way where Daphne flew

For such is all the sex 's flight
They fly from learning , wit , and light

They fly , and none can overtake
But some gay coxcomb , or a rake

How then , dear Harley , could I guess
That you should meet , in love , success

For , if those ancient tales be true
Phoebus was beautiful as you

Yet Daphne never slack 'd her pace
For wit and learning spoil 'd his face

And since the same resemblance held
In gifts wherein you both excelled

I fancied every nymph would run
From you , as from Latona 's son

Then where , said I , shall Harley find
A virgin of superior mind

With wit and virtue to discover
And pay the merit of her lover

This character shall Ca'endish claim
Born to retrieve her sex 's fame

The chief among the glittering crowd
Of titles , birth , and fortune proud

( As fools are insolent and vain
Madly aspired to wear her chain

But Pallas , guardian of the maid
Descending to her charge 's aid

Held out Medusa 's snaky locks
Which stupified them all to stocks

The nymph with indignation viewed
The dull , the noisy , and the lewd

For Pallas , with celestial light
Had purified her mortal sight

Show 'd her the virtues all combined
Fresh blooming , in young Harley 's mind

Terrestrial nymphs , by formal arts
Display their various nets for hearts

Their looks are all by method set
When to be prude , and when coquette

Yet , wanting skill and power to chuse
Their only pride is to refuse

But , when a goddess would bestow
Her love on some bright youth below

Round all the earth she casts her eyes
And then , descending from the skies

Makes choice of him she fancies best
And bids the ravish 'd youth be blessed

Thus the bright empress of the morn
Chose for her spouse a mortal born

The goddess made advances first
Else what aspiring hero durst

Though , like a virgin of fifteen
She blushes when by mortals seen

Still blushes , and with speed retires
When Sol pursues her with his fires

Diana thus , Heaven 's chastest queen
Struck with Endymion 's graceful mien

Down from her silver chariot came
And to the shepherd own 'd her flame

Thus Ca'endish , as Aurora bright
And chaster than the Queen of Night

Descended from her sphere to find
A mortal of superior kind

Desponding Phyllis was endued
With ev'ry talent of a prude

She trembled when a man drew near
Salute her , and she turn 'd her ear

If o'er against her you were placed
She durst not look above your waist

She 'd rather take you to her bed
Than let you see her dress her head

In church you hear her , thro ' the crowd
Repeat the absolution loud

In church , secure behind her fan
She durst behold that monster man

There practis 'd how to place her head
And bite her lips to make them red

Or , on the mat devoutly kneeling
Would lift her eyes up to the ceiling

And heave her bosom unaware
For neighb'ring beaux to see it bare

At length a lucky lover came
And found admittance to the dame

Suppose all parties now agreed
The writings drawn , the lawyer feed

The vicar and the ring bespoke
Guess , how could such a match be broke

See then what mortals place their bliss in
Next morn betimes the bride was missing

The mother scream 'd , the father chid
Where can this idle wench be hid

No news of Phyl ! the bridegroom came
And thought his bride had skulk 'd for shame

Because her father used to say
The girl had such a bashful way

Now John the butler must be sent
To learn the road that Phyllis went

The groom was wish 'd to saddle Crop
For John must neither light nor stop

But find her , wheresoe'er she fled
And bring her back alive or dead

See here again the devil to do
For truly John was missing too

The horse and pillion both were gone
Phyllis , it seems , was fled with John

Old Madam , who went up to find
What papers Phyl had left behind

A letter on the toilet sees
`` To my much honour 'd father -- these

( 'T is always done , romances tell us
When daughters run away with fellows

Fill 'd with the choicest common-places
By others used in the like cases

`` That long ago a fortune-teller
Exactly said what now befell her

And in a glass had made her see
A serving-man of low degree

It was her fate , must be forgiven
For marriages were made in Heaven

His pardon begg 'd : but , to be plain
She 'd do't if 'twere to do again

Thank 'd God , 't was neither shame nor sin
For John was come of honest kin

Love never thinks of rich and poor
She 'd beg with John from door to door

Forgive her , if it be a crime
She 'll never do't another time

She ne'er before in all her life
Once disobey 'd him , maid nor wife

One argument she summ 'd up all in
`` The thing was done and past recalling

And therefore hoped she should recover
His favour when his passion 's over

She valued not what others thought her
And was -- his most obedient daughter

Fair maidens all , attend the Muse
Who now the wand'ring pair pursues

Away they rode in homely sort
Their journey long , their money short

The loving couple well bemired
The horse and both the riders tired

Their victuals bad , their lodgings worse
Phyl cried ! and John began to curse

Phyl wish 'd that she had strain 'd a limb
When first she ventured out with him

John wish 'd that he had broke a leg
When first for her he quitted Peg

But what adventures more befell 'em
The Muse hath now no time to tell 'em

How Johnny wheedled , threaten 'd , fawned
Till Phyllis all her trinkets pawned

How oft she broke her marriage vows
In kindness to maintain her spouse

Till swains unwholesome spoil 'd the trade
For now the surgeon must be paid

To whom those perquisites are gone
In Christian justice due to John

When food and raiment now grew scarce
Fate put a period to the farce

And with exact poetic justice
For John was landlord , Phyllis hostess

They keep , at Stains , the Old Blue Boar
Are cat and dog , and rogue and whore

Virtue conceal 'd within our breast
Is inactivity at best

But never shall the Muse endure
To let your virtues lie obscure

Or suffer Envy to conceal
Your labours for the public weal

Within your breast all wisdom lies
Either to govern or advise

Your steady soul preserves her frame
In good and evil times , the same

Pale Avarice and lurking Fraud
Stand in your sacred presence awed

Your hand alone from gold abstains
Which drags the slavish world in chains

Him for a happy man I own
Whose fortune is not overgrown

And happy he who wisely knows
To use the gifts that Heaven bestows

Or , if it please the powers divine
Can suffer want and not repine

The man who infamy to shun
Into the arms of death would run

That man is ready to defend
With life , his country or his friend

To you whose virtues , I must own
With shame , I have too lately known

To you , by art and nature taught
To be the man I long have sought

Had not ill Fate , perverse and blind
Placed you in life too far behind

Or , what I should repine at more
Placed me in life too far before

To you the Muse this verse bestows
Which might as well have been in prose

No thought , no fancy , no sublime
But simple topics told in rhyme

Three gifts for conversation fit
Are humour , raillery , and wit

The last , as boundless as the wind
Is well conceived , though not defined

For , sure by wit is only meant
Applying what we first invent

What humour is , not all the tribe
Of logic-mongers can describe

Here only nature acts her part
Unhelp 'd by practice , books , or art

For wit and humour differ quite
That gives surprise , and this delight

Humour is odd , grotesque , and wild
Only by affectation spoiled

'T is never by invention got
Men have it when they know it not

Our conversation to refine
True humour must with wit combine

From both we learn to rally well
Wherein French writers most excel

Voiture , in various lights , displays
That irony which turns to praise

His genius first found out the rule
For an obliging ridicule

He flatters with peculiar air
The brave , the witty , and the fair

And fools would fancy he intends
A satire where he most commends

But as a poor pretending beau
Because he fain would make a show

Nor can afford to buy gold lace
Takes up with copper in the place

So the pert dunces of mankind
Whene'er they would be thought refined

Because the diff'rence lies abstruse
'Twixt raillery and gross abuse

To show their parts will scold and rail
Like porters o'er a pot of ale

Such is that clan of boisterous bears
Always together by the ears

Shrewd fellows and arch wags , a tribe
That meet for nothing but to gibe

Who first run one another down
And then fall foul on all the town

Skill 'd in the horse-laugh and dry rub
And call 'd by excellence The Club

I mean your butler , Dawson , Car
All special friends , and always jar

The mettled and the vicious steed
Do not more differ in their breed

Nay , Voiture is as like Tom Leigh
As rudeness is to repartee

If what you said I wish unspoke
'Twill not suffice it was a joke

Reproach not , though in jest , a friend
For those defects he can not mend

His lineage , calling , shape , or sense
If named with scorn , gives just offence

What use in life to make men fret
Part in worse humour than they met

Thus all society is lost
Men laugh at one another 's cost

And half the company is teazed
That came together to be pleased

For all buffoons have most in view
To please themselves by vexing you

When jests are carried on too far
And the loud laugh begins the war

You keep your countenance for shame
Yet still you think your friend to blame

For though men cry they love a jest
'T is but when others stand the test

And ( would you have their meaning known
They love a jest when 't is their own

You wonder now to see me write
So gravely where the subject 's light

Some part of what I here design
Regards a friend of yours and mine

Who full of humour , fire , and wit
Not always judges what is fit

But loves to take prodigious rounds
And sometimes walks beyond his bounds

You must , although the point be nice
Venture to give him some advice

Few hints from you will set him right
And teach him how to be polite

Bid him like you , observe with care
Whom to be hard on , whom to spare

Nor indiscreetly to suppose
All subjects like Dan Jackson 's nose

To study the obliging jest
By reading those who teach it best

For prose I recommend Voiture 's
For verse ( I speak my judgment ) yours

He 'll find the secret out from thence
To rhyme all day without offence

And I no more shall then accuse
The flirts of his ill-manner 'd Muse

If he be guilty , you must mend him
If he be innocent , defend him

Know all men by these presents , Death , the tamer
By mortgage has secured the corpse of Demar

Nor can four hundred thousand sterling pound
Redeem him from his prison underground

His heirs might well , of all his wealth possesst
Bestow , to bury him , one iron chest

Plutus , the god of wealth , will joy to know
His faithful steward in the shades below

He walk 'd the streets , and wore a threadbare cloak
He din 'd and supp 'd at charge of other folk

And by his looks , had he held out his palms
He might be thought an object fit for alms

So , to the poor if he refus 'd his pelf
He us 'd 'em full as kindly as himself

Where'er he went , he never saw his betters
Lords , knights , and squires , were all his humble debtors

And under hand and seal , the Irish nation
Were forc 'd to own to him their obligation

He that cou 'd once have half a kingdom bought
In half a minute is not worth a groat

His coffers from the coffin could not save
Nor all his int'rest keep him from the grave

A golden monument would not be right
Because we wish the earth upon him light

Oh London Tavern ! thou hast lost a friend
Tho ' in thy walls he ne'er did farthing spend

He touch 'd the pence when others touch 'd the pot
The hand that sign 'd the mortgage paid the shot

Old as he was , no vulgar known disease
On him could ever boast a pow ' r to seize

`` But as the gold he weigh 'd , grim death in spight
Cast in his dart , which made three moidores light

And , as he saw his darling money fail
Blew his last breath to sink the lighter scale

He who so long was current , 'twould be strange
If he should now be cry 'd down since his change

The sexton shall green sods on thee bestow
Alas , the sexton is thy banker now

A dismal banker must that banker be
Who gives no bills but of mortality

Beneath this verdant hillock lies
Demar , the wealthy and the wise

His heirs , that he might safely rest
Have put his carcass in a chest

The very chest in which , they say
His other self , his money , lay

And , if his heirs continue kind
To that dear self he left behind

I dare believe , that four in five
Will think his better self alive

You always are making a god of your spouse
But this neither Reason nor Conscience allows

Perhaps you will say , 't is in gratitude due
And you adore him , because he adores you

Your argument 's weak , and so you will find
For you , by this rule , must adore all mankind

Are the guests of this house still doom 'd to be cheated
Sure the Fates have decreed they by halves should be treated

In the days of good John if you came here to dine
You had choice of good meat , but no choice of good wine

In Jonathan 's reign , if you come here to eat
You have choice of good wine , but no choice of good meat

O Jove ! then how fully might all sides be blest
Wouldst thou but agree to this humble request

Put both deans in one ; or , if that 's too much trouble
Instead of the deans , make the deanery double

A bard , on whom Phoebus his spirit bestowed
Resolving t'acknowledge the bounty he owed

Found out a new method at once of confessing
And making the most of so mighty a blessing

To the God he 'd be grateful ; but mortals he 'd chouse
By making his patron preside in his house

And wisely foresaw this advantage from thence
That the God would in honour bear most of th'expense

So the bard he finds drink , and leaves Phoebus to treat
With the thoughts he inspires , regardless of meat

Hence they that come hither expecting to dine
Are always fobb 'd off with sheer wit and sheer wine

Right Trusty , and so forth -- we let you know
We are very ill used by you mortals below

For , first , I have often by chemists been told
( Though I know nothing o n't , ) it is I that make gold

Which when you have got , you so carefully hide it
That , since I was born , I hardly have spied it

Then it must be allow 'd , that , whenever I shine
I forward the grass , and I ripen the vine

To me the good fellows apply for relief
Without whom they could get neither claret nor beef

Yet their wine and their victuals , those curmudgeon lubbards
Lock up from my sight in cellars and cupboards

That I have an ill eye , they wickedly think
And taint all their meat , and sour all their drink

But , thirdly and lastly , it must be allowed
I alone can inspire the poetical crowd

This is gratefully own 'd by each boy in the College
Whom , if I inspire , it is not to my knowledge

This every pretender in rhyme will admit
Without troubling his head about judgment or wit

These gentlemen use me with kindness and freedom
And as for their works , when I please I may read 'em

They lie open on purpose on counters and stalls
And the titles I view , when I shine on the walls

But a comrade of yours , that traitor Delany
Whom I for your sake have used better than any

And , of my mere motion , and special good grace
Intended in time to succeed in your place

On Tuesday the tenth , seditiously came
With a certain false trait'ress , one Stella by name

To the Deanery-house , and on the North glass
Where for fear of the cold I never can pass

Then and there , vi et armis , with a certain utensil
Of value five shillings , in English a pencil

Did maliciously , falsely , and trait'rously write
While Stella , aforesaid , stood by with a light

My sister hath lately deposed upon oath
That she stopt in her course to look at them both

That Stella was helping , abetting , and aiding
And still as he writ , stood smiling and reading

That her eyes were as bright as myself at noon-day
But her graceful black locks were all mingled with grey

And by the description , I certainly know
'T is the nymph that I courted some ten years ago

Whom when I with the best of my talents endued
On her promise of yielding , she acted the prude

That some verses were writ with felonious intent
Direct to the North , where I never once went

That the letters appear 'd reversed through the pane
But in Stella 's bright eyes were placed right again

Wherein she distinctly could read ev'ry line
And presently guessed the fancy was mine

She can swear to the Parson whom oft she has seen
At night between Cavan Street and College Green

Now you see why his verses so seldom are shown
The reason is plain , they are none of his own

And observe while you live that no man is shy
To discover the goods he came honestly by

If I light on a thought , he will certainly steal it
And when he has got it , find ways to conceal it

Of all the fine things he keeps in the dark
There 's scarce one in ten but what has my mark

And let them be seen by the world if he dare
I 'll make it appear they are all stolen ware

But as for the poem he writ on your sash
I think I have now got him under my lash

My sister transcribed it last night to his sorrow
And the public shall see't , if I live till to-morrow

Thro ' the zodiac around , it shall quickly be spread
In all parts of the globe where your language is read

He knows very well , I ne'er gave a refusal
When he ask 'd for my aid in the forms that are usual

But the secret is this ; I did lately intend
To write a few verses on you as my friend

I studied a fortnight , before I could find
As I rode in my chariot , a thought to my mind

And resolved the next winter ( for that is my time
When the days are at shortest ) to get it in rhyme

Till then it was lock 'd in my box at Parnassus
When that subtle companion , in hopes to surpass us

Conveys out my paper of hints by a trick
( For I think in my conscience he deals with old Nick

And from my own stock provided with topics
He gets to a window beyond both the tropics

There out of my sight , just against the north zone
Writes down my conceits , and then calls them his own

And you , like a cully , the bubble can swallow
Now who but Delany that writes like Apollo

High treason by statute ! yet here you object
He only stole hints , but the verse is correct

Though the thought be Apollo 's , 't is finely expressed
So a thief steals my horse , and has him well dressed

Now whereas the said criminal seems past repentance
We Phoebus think fit to proceed to his sentence

Since Delany hath dared , like Prometheus his sire
To climb to our region , and thence to steal fire

We order a vulture in shape of the Spleen
To prey on his liver , but not to be seen

And we order our subjects of every degree
To believe all his verses were written by me

And under the pain of our highest displeasure
To call nothing his but the rhyme and the measure

And , lastly , for Stella , just out of her prime
I 'm too much revenged already by Time

In return of her scorn , I sent her diseases
But will now be her friend whenever she pleases

And the gifts I bestow 'd her will find her a lover
Though she lives till she 's grey as a badger all over

Parnassus , February the twenty-seventh
The poets assembled here on the eleventh

Convened by Apollo , who gave them to know
He 'd have a vicegerent in his empire below

But declared that no bard should this honour inherit
Till the rest had agreed he surpass 'd them in merit

Now this , you 'll allow , was a difficult case
For each bard believed he 'd a right to the place

So , finding the assembly grow warm in debate
He put them in mind of his Phaethon 's fate

'T was urged to no purpose ; disputes higher rose
Scarce Phoebus himself could their quarrels compose

Till at length he determined that every bard
Should ( each in his turn ) be patiently heard

First , one who believed he excell 'd in translation
Founds his claim on the doctrine of man 's transmigration

`` Since the soul of great Milton was given to me
I hope the convention will quickly agree

`` Agree ; '' quoth Apollo : `` from whence is this fool
Is he just come from reading Pythagoras at school

Begone , sir , you 've got your subscriptions in time
And given in return neither reason nor rhyme

To the next says the God , `` Though now I wo n't chuse you
I 'll tell you the reason for which I refuse you

Love 's Goddess has oft to her parents complained
Of my favouring a bard who her empire disdained

That at my instigation , a poem you writ
Which to beauty and youth preferr 'd judgment and wit

That , to make you a Laureate , I gave the first voice
Inspiring the Britons t'approve of my choice

Jove sent her to me , her power to try
The Goddess of Beauty what God can deny

She forbids your preferment ; I grant her desire
Appease the fair Goddess : you then may rise higher

The next that appear 'd had good hopes of succeeding
For he merited much for his wit and his breeding

'T was wise in the Britons no favour to show him
He else might expect they should pay what they owe him

And therefore they prudently chose to discard
The Patriot , whose merits they would not reward

The God , with a smile , bade his favourite advance
`` You were sent by Astraea her envoy to France

You bend your ambition to rise in the state
I refuse you , because you could stoop to be great

Then a bard who had been a successful translator
`` The convention allows me a versificator

Says Apollo , `` You mention the least of your merit
By your works , it appears you have much of my spirit

I esteem you so well , that , to tell you the truth
The greatest objection against you 's your youth

Then be not concern 'd you are now laid aside
If you live you shall certainly one day preside

Another , low bending , Apollo thus greets
`` 'T was I taught your subjects to walk through the streets

You taught them to walk ! why , they knew it before
But give me the bard that can teach them to soar

Whenever he claims , 't is his right , I 'll confess
Who lately attempted my style with success

Who writes like Apollo has most of his spirit
And therefore 't is just I distinguish his merit

Who makes it appear , by all he has writ
His judgment alone can set bounds to his wit

Like Virgil correct , with his own native ease
But excels even Virgil in elegant praise

Who admires the ancients , and knows 't is their due
Yet writes in a manner entirely new

Though none with more ease their depths can explore
Yet whatever he wants he takes from my store

Though I 'm fond of his virtues , his pride I can see
In scorning to borrow from any but me

It is owing to this , that , like Cynthia , his lays
Enlighten the world by reflecting my rays

This said , the whole audience soon found out his drift
The convention was summon 'd in favour of SWIFT

Ireland is now our royal care
We lately fix 'd our viceroy there

How near was she to be undone
Till pious love inspired her son

What can not our vicegerent do
As poet and as patriot too

Let his success our subjects sway
Our inspirations to obey

Then study to correct your taste
Nor beaten paths be longer traced

No simile shall be begun
With rising or with setting sun

And let the secret head of Nile
Be ever banish 'd from your isle

When wretched lovers live on air
I beg you 'll the chameleon spare

And when you 'd make a hero grander
Forget he 's like a salamander

No son of mine shall dare to say
Aurora usher 'd in the day

You all agree , I make no doubt
Elijah 's mantle is worn out

The bird of Jove shall toil no more
To teach the humble wren to soar

Your tragic heroes shall not rant
Nor shepherds use poetic cant

Simplicity alone can grace
The manners of the rural race

Theocritus and Philips be
Your guides to true simplicity

When Damon 's soul shall take its flight
Though poets have the second-sight

Nor shall the vapours upwards rise
Nor a new star adorn the skies

For who can hope to place one there
As glorious as Belinda 's hair

Yet , if his name you 'd eternize
And must exalt him to the skies

Without a star this may be done
So Tickell mourn 'd his Addison

If Anna 's happy reign you praise
Pray , not a word of halcyon days

Nor let my votaries show their skill
In aping lines from Cooper 's Hill

For know I can not bear to hear
The mimicry of `` deep , yet clear

Whene'er my viceroy is addressed
Against the phoenix I protest

When poets soar in youthful strains
No Phaethon to hold the reins

When you describe a lovely girl
No lips of coral , teeth of pearl

Cupid shall ne'er mistake another
However beauteous , for his mother

Nor shall his darts at random fly
From magazine in Celia 's eye

With woman compounds I am cloyed
Which only pleased in Biddy Floyd

For foreign aid what need they roam
Whom fate has amply blest at home

Unerring Heaven , with bounteous hand
Has form 'd a model for your land

Whom Jove endued with every grace
The glory of the Granard race

Now destined by the powers divine
The blessing of another line

Then , would you paint a matchless dame
Whom you 'd consign to endless fame

Invoke not Cytherea 's aid
Nor borrow from the blue-eyed maid

Nor need you on the Graces call
Take qualities from Donegal

AETATIS SUAE fifty-two
A reverend Dean began to woo

A handsome , young , imperious girl
Nearly related to an earl

Her parents and her friends consent
The couple to the temple went

They first invite the Cyprian queen
'T was answer 'd , `` She would not be seen

But Cupid in disdain could scarce
Forbear to bid them kiss his

The Graces next , and all the Muses
Were bid in form , but sent excuses

Juno attended at the porch
With farthing candle for a torch

While mistress Iris held her train
The faded bow bedropt with rain

Then Hebe came , and took her place
But show 'd no more than half her face

Whate'er these dire forebodings meant
In joy the marriage-day was spent

The marriage-_day_ , you take me right
I promise nothing for the night

The bridegroom , drest to make a figure
Assumes an artificial vigour

A flourish 'd nightcap on , to grace
His ruddy , wrinkled , smirking face

Like the faint red upon a pippin
Half wither 'd by a winter 's keeping

And thus set out this happy pair
The swain is rich , the nymph is fair

But , what I gladly would forget
The swain is old , the nymph coquette

Both from the goal together start
Scarce run a step before they part

No common ligament that binds
The various textures of their minds

Their thoughts and actions , hopes and fears
Less corresponding than their years

The Dean desires his coffee soon
She rises to her tea at noon

While the Dean goes out to cheapen books
She at the glass consults her looks

While Betty 's buzzing at her ear
Lord , what a dress these parsons wear

So odd a choice how could she make
Wish 'd him a colonel for her sake

Then , on her finger ends she counts
Exact , to what his age amounts

The Dean , she heard her uncle say
Is sixty , if he be a day

His ruddy cheeks are no disguise
You see the crow 's feet round his eyes

At one she rambles to the shops
To cheapen tea , and talk with fops

Or calls a council of her maids
And tradesmen , to compare brocades

Her weighty morning business o'er
Sits down to dinner just at four

Minds nothing that is done or said
Her evening work so fills her head

The Dean , who used to dine at one
Is mawkish , and his stomach 's gone

In threadbare gown , would scarce a louse hold
Looks like the chaplain of the household

Beholds her , from the chaplain 's place
In French brocades , and Flanders lace

He wonders what employs her brain
But never asks , or asks in vain

His mind is full of other cares
And , in the sneaking parson 's airs

Computes , that half a parish dues
Will hardly find his wife in shoes

Canst thou imagine , dull divine
'Twill gain her love , to make her fine

Hath she no other wants beside
You feed her lust as well as pride

Enticing coxcombs to adore
And teach her to despise thee more

If in her coach she 'll condescend
To place him at the hinder end

Her hoop is hoist above his nose
His odious gown would soil her clothes

She drops him at the church , to pray
While she drives on to see the play

He like an orderly divine
Comes home a quarter after nine

And meets her hasting to the ball
Her chairmen push him from the wall

The Dean gets in and walks up stairs
And calls the family to prayers

Then goes alone to take his rest
In bed , where he can spare her best

At five the footmen make a din
Her ladyship is just come in

The masquerade began at two
She stole away with much ado

And shall be chid this afternoon
For leaving company so soon

She 'll say , and she may truly say't
She ca n't abide to stay out late

But now , though scarce a twelvemonth married
Poor Lady Jane has thrice miscarried

The cause , alas ! is quickly guest
The town has whisper 'd round the jest

Think on some remedy in time
The Dean you see , is past his prime

Already dwindled to a lath
No other way but try the Bath

For Venus , rising from the ocean
Infused a strong prolific potion

That mix 'd with AcheloÃƒÂ¼s spring
The horned flood , as poets sing

Who , with an English beauty smitten
Ran under ground from Greece to Britain

The genial virtue with him brought
And gave the nymph a plenteous draught

Then fled , and left his horn behind
For husbands past their youth to find

The nymph , who still with passion burned
Was to a boiling fountain turned

Where childless wives crowd every morn
To drink in AcheloÃƒÂ¼s horn

Or bathe beneath the Cross their limbs
Where fruitful matter chiefly swims

And here the father often gains
That title by another 's pains

Hither , though much against his grain
The Dean has carried Lady Jane

He , for a while , would not consent
But vow 'd his money all was spent

Was ever such a clownish reason
And must my lady slip her season

The doctor , with a double fee
Was bribed to make the Dean agree

Here , all diversions of the place
Are proper in my lady 's case

With which she patiently complies
Merely because her friends advise

His money and her time employs
In music , raffling-rooms , and toys

Or in the Cross-bath seeks an heir
Since others oft have found one there

Where if the Dean by chance appears
It shames his cassock and his years

He keeps his distance in the gallery
Till banish 'd by some coxcomb 's raillery

For 'twould his character expose
To bathe among the belles and beaux

So have I seen , within a pen
Young ducklings foster 'd by a hen

But , when let out , they run and muddle
As instinct leads them , in a puddle

The sober hen , not born to swim
With mournful note clucks round the brim

The Dean , with all his best endeavour
Gets not an heir , but gets a fever

A victim to the last essays
Of vigour in declining days

He dies , and leaves his mourning mate
( What could he less ? ) his whole estate

The widow goes through all her forms
New lovers now will come in swarms

O , may I see her soon dispensing
Her favours to some broken ensign

Him let her marry for his face
And only coat of tarnish 'd lace

To turn her naked out of doors
And spend her jointure on his whores

But , for a parting present , leave her
A rooted pox to last for ever

The farmer 's goose , who in the stubble
Has fed without restraint or trouble

Grown fat with corn and sitting still
Can scarce get o'er the barn-door sill

And hardly waddles forth to cool
Her belly in the neighbouring pool

Nor loudly cackles at the door
For cackling shows the goose is poor

But , when she must be turn 'd to graze
And round the barren common strays

Hard exercise , and harder fare
Soon make my dame grow lank and spare

Her body light , she tries her wings
And scorns the ground , and upward springs

While all the parish , as she flies
Hear sounds harmonious from the skies

Such is the poet fresh in pay
The third night 's profits of his play

His morning draughts till noon can swill
Among his brethren of the quill

With good roast beef his belly full
Grown lazy , foggy , fat , and dull

Deep sunk in plenty and delight
What poet e'er could take his flight

Or , stuff 'd with phlegm up to the throat
What poet e'er could sing a note

Nor Pegasus could bear the load
Along the high celestial road

The steed , oppress 'd , would break his girth
To raise the lumber from the earth

But view him in another scene
When all his drink is Hippocrene

His money spent , his patrons fail
His credit out for cheese and ale

His two-years coat so smooth and bare
Through every thread it lets in air

With hungry meals his body pined
His guts and belly full of wind

And , like a jockey for a race
His flesh brought down to flying case

Now his exalted spirit loathes
Encumbrances of food and clothes

And up he rises like a vapour
Supported high on wings of paper

He singing flies , and flying sings
While from below all Grub-Street rings

Our set of strollers , wandering up and down
Hearing the house was empty , came to town

And , with a license from our good lord mayor
Went to one Griffith , formerly a player

Him we persuaded , with a moderate bribe
To speak to Elrington and all the tribe

To let our company supply their places
And hire us out their scenes , and clothes , and faces

Is not the truth the truth ? Look full on me
I am not Elrington , nor Griffith he

When we perform , look sharp among our crew
There 's not a creature here you ever knew

The former folks were servants to the king
We , humble strollers , always on the wing

Now , for my part , I think , upon the whole
Rather than starve , a better man would stroll

Stay ! let me see -- Three hundred pounds a-year
For leave to act in town ! -- 'T is plaguy dear

Now , here 's a warrant ; gallants , please to mark
For three thirteens , and sixpence to the clerk

Three hundred pounds ! Were I the price to fix
The public should bestow the actors six

A score of guineas given underhand
For a good word or so , we understand

To help an honest lad that 's out of place
May cost a crown or so ; a common case

And , in a crew , 't is no injustice thought
To ship a rogue , and pay him not a groat

But , in the chronicles of former ages
Who ever heard of servants paying wages

I pity Elrington with all my heart
Would he were here this night to act my part

I told him what it was to be a stroller
How free we acted , and had no comptroller

In every town we wait on Mr. Mayor
First get a license , then produce our ware

We sound a trumpet , or we beat a drum
Huzza ! ( the schoolboys roar ) the players are come

And then we cry , to spur the bumpkins on
Gallants , by Tuesday next we must be gone

I told him in the smoothest way I could
All this , and more , yet it would do no good

But Elrington , tears falling from his cheeks
He that has shone with Betterton and Wilks

To whom our country has been always dear
Who chose to leave his dearest pledges here

Owns all your favours , here intends to stay
And , as a stroller , act in every play

And the whole crew this resolution takes
To live and die all strollers , for your sakes

Not frighted with an ignominious name
For your displeasure is their only shame

A pox on Elrington 's majestic tone
Now to a word of business in our own

Gallants , next Thursday night will be our last
Then without fail we pack up for Belfast

Lose not your time , nor our diversion miss
The next we act shall be as good as this

HOLD ! hold , my good friends ; for one moment , pray stop ye
I return ye my thanks , in the name of poor Hoppy

He 's not the first person who never did write
And yet has been fed by a benefit-night

The custom is frequent , on my word I assure ye
In our famed elder house , of the Hundreds of Drury

But then you must know , those players still act on
Some very good reasons , for such benefaction

A deceased poet 's widow , if pretty , ca n't fail
From Cibber she holds , as a tenant in tail

Your emerited actors , and actresses too
For what they have done ( though no more they can do

And sitters , and songsters , and Chetwood and G
And sometimes a poor sufferer in the South Sea

A machine-man , a tire-woman , a mute , and a spright
Have been all kept from starving by a benefit-night

Thus , for Hoppy 's bright merits , at length we have found
That he must have of us ninety-nine and one pound

Paid to him clear money once every year
And however some think it a little too dear

Yet , for reasons of state , this sum we 'll allow
Though we pay the good man with the sweat of our brow

First , because by the King to us he was sent
To guide the whole session of this parliament

To preside in our councils , both public and private
And so learn , by the by , what both houses do drive at

When bold B -- -- roars , and meek M -- -- raves
When Ash prates by wholesale , or Be -- -- h by halves

When Whigs become Whims , or join with the Tories
And to himself constant when a member no more is

But changes his sides , and votes and unvotes
As S -- -- t is dull , and with S -- -- d , who dotes

Then up must get Hoppy , and with voice very low
And with eloquent bow , the house he must show

That that worthy member who spoke last must give
The freedom to him , humbly most , to conceive

That his sentiment on this affair is n't right
That he mightily wonders which way he came by't

That , for his part , God knows , he does such things disown
And so , having convinced him , he most humbly sits down

For these , and more reasons , which perhaps you may hear
Pounds hundred this night , and one hundred this year

And so on we are forced , though we sweat out our blood
To make these walls pay for poor Hoppy 's good

To supply with rare diet his pot and his spit
And with richest Margoux to wash down a tit-bit

To wash oft his fine linen , so clean and so neat
And to buy him much linen , to fence against sweat

All which he deserves ; for although all the day
He ofttimes is heavy , yet all night he 's gay

And if he rise early to watch for the state
To keep up his spirits he 'll sit up as late

Thus , for these and more reasons , as before I did say
Hop has got all the money for our acting this play

Great cry , and little wool -- is now become
The plague and proverb of the weaver 's loom

No wool to work on , neither weft nor warp
Their pockets empty , and their stomachs sharp

Provoked , in loud complaints to you they cry
Ladies , relieve the weavers ; or they die

Forsake your silks for stuff 's ; nor think it strange
To shift your clothes , since you delight in change

One thing with freedom I 'll presume to tell
The men will like you every bit as well

See I am dress 'd from top to toe in stuff
And , by my troth , I think I 'm fine enough

My wife admires me more , and swears she never
In any dress , beheld me look so clever

And if a man be better in such ware
What great advantage must it give the fair

Our wool from lambs of innocence proceeds
Silks come from maggots , calicoes from weeds

Hence 't is by sad experience that we find
Ladies in silks to vapours much inclined

For which I think it reason to conclude
That clothes may change our temper like our food

Chintzes are gawdy , and engage our eyes
Too much about the party-colour 'd dyes

Although the lustre is from you begun
We see the rainbow , and neglect the sun

How sweet and innocent 's the country maid
With small expense in native wool arrayed

Who copies from the fields her homely green
While by her shepherd with delight she 's seen

Should our fair ladies dress like her , in wool
How much more lovely , and how beautiful

Without their Indian drapery , they 'd prove
While wool would help to warm us into love

Then , like the famous Argonauts of Greece
We 'll all contend to gain the Golden Fleece

Who dares affirm this is no pious age
When charity begins to tread the stage

When actors , who at best are hardly savers
Will give a night of benefit to weavers

Stay -- let me see , how finely will it sound
_Imprimis_ , From his grace a hundred pound

Peers , clergy , gentry , all are benefactors
And then comes in the _item_ of the actors

_Item_ , The actors freely give a day
The poet had no more who made the play

But whence this wondrous charity in players
They learn it not at sermons , or at prayers

Under the rose , since here are none but friends
( To own the truth ) we have some private ends

Since waiting-women , like exacting jades
Hold up the prices of their old brocades

We 'll dress in manufactures made at home
Equip our kings and generals at the Comb

We 'll rig from Meath Street Egypt 's haughty queen
And Antony shall court her in ratteen

In blue shalloon shall Hannibal be clad
And Scipio trail an Irish purple plaid

In drugget drest , of thirteen pence a-yard
See Philip 's son amidst his Persian guard

And proud Roxana , fired with jealous rage
With fifty yards of crape shall sweep the stage

In short , our kings and princesses within
Are all resolved this project to begin

And you , our subjects , when you here resort
Must imitate the fashion of the court

O ! could I see this audience clad in stuff
Though money 's scarce , we should have trade enough

But chintz , brocades , and lace , take all away
And scarce a crown is left to see the play

Perhaps you wonder whence this friendship springs
Between the weavers and us playhouse kings

But wit and weaving had the same beginning
Pallas first taught us poetry and spinning

And , next , observe how this alliance fits
For weavers now are just as poor as wits

Their brother quillmen , workers for the stage
For sorry stuff can get a crown a page

But weavers will be kinder to the players
And sell for twenty pence a yard of theirs

And to your knowledge , there is often less in
The poet 's wit , than in the player 's dressing

The Muses , whom the richest silks array
Refuse to fling their shining gowns away

The pencil clothes the nine in bright brocades
And gives each colour to the pictured maids

Far above mortal dress the sisters shine
Pride in their Indian Robes , and must be fine

And shall two bards in concert rhyme , and huff
And fret these Muses with their playhouse stuff

The player in mimic piety may storm
Deplore the Comb , and bid her heroes arm

The arbitrary mob , in paltry rage
May curse the belles and chintzes of the age

Yet still the artist worm her silk shall share
And spin her thread of life in service of the fair

The cotton plant , whom satire can not blast
Shall bloom the favourite of these realms , and last

Like yours , ye fair , her fame from censure grows
Prevails in charms , and glares above her foes

Your injured plant shall meet a loud defence
And be the emblem of your innocence

Some bard , perhaps , whose landlord was a weaver
Penn 'd the low prologue to return a favour

Some neighbour wit , that would be in the vogue
Work 'd with his friend , and wove the epilogue

Who weaves the chaplet , or provides the bays
For such wool-gathering sonnetteers as these

Hence , then , ye homespun witlings , that persuade
Miss Chloe to the fashion of her maid

Shall the wide hoop , that standard of the town
Thus act subservient to a poplin gown

Who 'd smell of wool all over ? 'T is enough
The under petticoat be made of stuff

Lord ! to be wrapt in flannel just in May
When the fields dress 'd in flowers appear so gay

In what weak colours would the plaid appear
Work 'd to a quilt , or studded in a chair

The skin , that vies with silk , would fret with stuff
Or who could bear in bed a thing so rough

Ye knowing fair , how eminent that bed
Where the chintz diamonds with the silken thread

Where rustling curtains call the curious eye
And boast the streaks and paintings of the sky

Of flocks they 'd have your milky ticking full
And all this for the benefit of wool

`` But where , '' say they , `` shall we bestow these weavers
That spread our streets , and are such piteous cravers

The silk-worms ( brittle beings ! ) prone to fate
Demand their care , to make their webs complete

These may they tend , their promises receive
We can not pay too much for what they give

Thalia , tell , in sober lays
How George , Nim , Dan , Dean , pass their days

And , should our Gaulstown 's wit grow fallow
Yet _Neget quis carmina Gallo

Here ( by the way ) by Gallus mean I
Not Sheridan , but friend Delany

Begin , my Muse ! First from our bowers
We sally forth at different hours

At seven the Dean , in night-gown drest
Goes round the house to wake the rest

At nine , grave Nim and George facetious
Go to the Dean , to read Lucretius

At ten my lady comes and hectors
And kisses George , and ends our lectures

And when she has him by the neck fast
Hauls him , and scolds us , down to breakfast

We squander there an hour or more
And then all hands , boys , to the oar

All , heteroclite Dan except
Who never time nor order kept

But by peculiar whimseys drawn
Peeps in the ponds to look for spawn

O'ersees the work , or Dragon rows
Or mars a text , or mends his hose

Or -- but proceed we in our journal
At two , or after , we return all

From the four elements assembling
Warn 'd by the bell , all folks come trembling

From airy garrets some descend
Some from the lake 's remotest end

My lord and Dean the fire forsake
Dan leaves the earthy spade and rake

The loiterers quake , no corner hides them
And Lady Betty soundly chides them

Now water brought , and dinner done
With `` Church and King '' the ladies gone

Not reckoning half an hour we pass
In talking o'er a moderate glass

Dan , growing drowsy , like a thief
Steals off to doze away his beef

And this must pass for reading Hammond
While George and Dean go to backgammon

George , Nim , and Dean , set out at four
And then , again , boys , to the oar

But when the sun goes to the deep
( Not to disturb him in his sleep

Or make a rumbling o'er his head
His candle out , and he a-bed

We watch his motions to a minute
And leave the flood when he goes in it

Now stinted in the shortening day
We go to prayers and then to play

Till supper comes ; and after that
We sit an hour to drink and chat

'T is late -- the old and younger pairs
By Adam lighted , walk up stairs

The weary Dean goes to his chamber
And Nim and Dan to garret clamber

So when the circle we have run
The curtain falls and all is done

I might have mention 'd several facts
Like episodes between the acts

And tell who loses and who wins
Who gets a cold , who breaks his shins

How Dan caught nothing in his net
And how the boat was overset

For brevity I have retrenched
How in the lake the Dean was drenched

It would be an exploit to brag on
How valiant George rode o'er the Dragon

How steady in the storm he sat
And saved his oar , but lost his hat

How Nim ( no hunter e'er could match him
Still brings us hares , when he can catch 'em

How skilfully Dan mends his nets
How fortune fails him when he sets

Or how the Dean delights to vex
The ladies , and lampoon their sex

I might have told how oft Dean Perceval
Displays his pedantry unmerciful

How haughtily he cocks his nose
To tell what every schoolboy knows

And with his finger and his thumb
Explaining , strikes opposers dumb

But now there needs no more be said o n't
Nor how his wife , that female pedant

Shews all her secrets of housekeeping
For candles how she trucks her dripping

Was forced to send three miles for yeast
To brew her ale , and raise her paste

Tells everything that you can think of
How she cured Charley of the chincough

What gave her brats and pigs the measles
And how her doves were killed by weasels

How Jowler howl 'd , and what a fright
She had with dreams the other night

But now , since I have gone so far on
A word or two of Lord Chief Baron

And tell how little weight he sets
On all Whig papers and gazettes

But for the politics of Pue
Thinks every syllable is true

And since he owns the King of Sweden
Is dead at last , without evading

Now all his hopes are in the czar
`` Why , Muscovy is not so far

Down the Black Sea , and up the Straits
And in a month he 's at your gates

Perhaps from what the packet brings
By Christmas we shall see strange things

Why should I tell of ponds and drains
What carps we met with for our pains

Of sparrows tamed , and nuts innumerable
To choke the girls , and to consume a rabble

But you , who are a scholar , know
How transient all things are below

How prone to change is human life
Last night arrived Clem and his wife

This grand event has broke our measures
Their reign began with cruel seizures

The Dean must with his quilt supply
The bed in which those tyrants lie

Nim lost his wig-block , Dan his Jordan
( My lady says , she ca n't afford one

George is half scared out of his wits
For Clem gets all the dainty bits

Henceforth expect a different survey
This house will soon turn topsyturvy

They talk of farther alterations
Which causes many speculations

WOULD you that Delville I describe
Believe me , Sir , I will not gibe

For who would be satirical
Upon a thing so very small

You scarce upon the borders enter
Before you 're at the very centre

A single crow can make it night
When o'er your farm she takes her flight

Yet , in this narrow compass , we
Observe a vast variety

Both walks , walls , meadows , and parterres
Windows and doors , and rooms and stairs

And hills and dales , and woods and fields
And hay , and grass , and corn , it yields

All to your haggard brought so cheap in
Without the mowing or the reaping

A razor , though to say't I 'm loth
Would shave you and your meadows both

Though small 's the farm , yet here 's a house
Full large to entertain a mouse

But where a rat is dreaded more
Than savage Caledonian boar

For , if it 's enter 'd by a rat
There is no room to bring a cat

A little rivulet seems to steal
Down through a thing you call a vale

Like tears adown a wrinkled cheek
Like rain along a blade of leek

And this you call your sweet meander
Which might be suck 'd up by a gander

Could he but force his nether bill
To scoop the channel of the rill

For sure you 'd make a mighty clutter
Were it as big as city gutter

Next come I to your kitchen garden
Where one poor mouse would fare but hard in

And round this garden is a walk
No longer than a tailor 's chalk

Thus I compare what space is in it
A snail creeps round it in a minute

One lettuce makes a shift to squeeze
Up through a tuft you call your trees

And , once a year , a single rose
Peeps from the bud , but never blows

In vain then you expect its bloom
It can not blow for want of room

In short , in all your boasted seat
There 's nothing but yourself that 's GREAT

A bard , grown desirous of saving his pelf
Built a house he was sure would hold none but himself

This enraged god Apollo , who Mercury sent
And bid him go ask what his votary meant

`` Some foe to my empire has been his adviser
'T is of dreadful portent when a poet turns miser

Tell him , Hermes , from me , tell that subject of mine
I have sworn by the Styx , to defeat his design

For wherever he lives , the Muses shall reign
And the Muses , he knows , have a numerous train

Lo ! from the top of yonder cliff , that shrouds
Its airy head amid the azure clouds

Hangs a huge fragment ; destitute of props
Prone on the wave the rocky ruin drops

With hoarse rebuff the swelling seas rebound
From shore to shore the rocks return the sound

The dreadful murmur Heaven 's high convex cleaves
And Neptune shrinks beneath his subject waves

For , long the whirling winds and beating tides
Had scoop 'd a vault into its nether sides

Now yields the base , the summits nod , now urge
Their headlong course , and lash the sounding surge

Not louder noise could shake the guilty world
When Jove heap 'd mountains upon mountains hurled

Retorting Pelion from his dread abode
To crush Earth 's rebel sons beneath the load

Oft too with hideous yawn the cavern wide
Presents an orifice on either side

A dismal orifice , from sea to sea
Extended , pervious to the God of Day

Uncouthly join 'd , the rocks stupendous form
An arch , the ruin of a future storm

High on the cliff their nests the woodquests make
And sea-calves stable in the oozy lake

But when bleak Winter with his sullen train
Awakes the winds to vex the watery plain

When o'er the craggy steep without control
Big with the blast , the raging billows roll

Not towns beleaguer 'd , not the flaming brand
Darted from Heaven by Jove 's avenging hand

Oft as on impious men his wrath he pours
Humbles their pride and blasts their gilded towers

Equal the tumult of this wild uproar
Waves rush o'er waves , rebellows shore to shore

The neighbouring race , though wont to brave the shocks
Of angry seas , and run along the rocks

Now , pale with terror , while the ocean foams
Fly far and wide , nor trust their native homes

The goats , while , pendent from the mountain top
The wither 'd herb improvident they crop

Wash 'd down the precipice with sudden sweep
Leave their sweet lives beneath th'unfathom 'd deep

The frighted fisher , with desponding eyes
Though safe , yet trembling in the harbour lies

Nor hoping to behold the skies serene
Wearies with vows the monarch of the main

COME , be content , since out it must
For Stella has betray 'd her trust

And , whispering , charged me not to say
That Mr. Ford was born to-day

Or , if at last I needs must blab it
According to my usual habit

She bid me , with a serious face
Be sure conceal the time and place

And not my compliment to spoil
By calling this your native soil

Or vex the ladies , when they knew
That you are turning forty-two

But , if these topics shall appear
Strong arguments to keep you here

I think , though you judge hardly of it
Good manners must give place to profit

The nymphs , with whom you first began
Are each become a harridan

And Montague so far decayed
Her lovers now must all be paid

And every belle that since arose
Has her contemporary beaux

Your former comrades , once so bright
With whom you toasted half the night

Of rheumatism and pox complain
And bid adieu to dear champaign

Your great protectors , once in power
Are now in exile or the Tower

Your foes triumphant o'er the laws
Who hate your person and your cause

If once they get you on the spot
You must be guilty of the plot

For , true or false , they 'll ne'er inquire
But use you ten times worse than Prior

In London ! what would you do there
Can you , my friend , with patience bear

( Nay , would it not your passion raise
Worse than a pun , or Irish phrase

To see a scoundrel strut and hector
A foot-boy to some rogue director

To look on vice triumphant round
And virtue trampled on the ground

Observe where bloody * * * * stands
With torturing engines in his hands

Hear him blaspheme , and swear , and rail
Threatening the pillory and jail

If this you think a pleasing scene
To London straight return again

Where , you have told us from experience
Are swarms of bugs and presbyterians

I thought my very spleen would burst
When fortune hither drove me first

Was full as hard to please as you
Nor persons ' names nor places knew

But now I act as other folk
Like prisoners when their gaol is broke

If you have London still at heart
We 'll make a small one here by art

The difference is not much between
St. James 's Park and Stephen 's Green

And Dawson Street will serve as well
To lead you thither as Pall Mall

Nor want a passage through the palace
To choke your sight , and raise your malice

The Deanery-house may well be matched
Under correction , with the Thatched

Nor shall I , when you hither come
Demand a crown a-quart for stum

Then for a middle-aged charmer
Stella may vie with your Mounthermer

She 's now as handsome every bit
And has a thousand times her wit

The Dean and Sheridan , I hope
Will half supply a Gay and Pope

Corbet , though yet I know his worth not
No doubt , will prove a good Arbuthnot

I throw into the bargain Tim
In London can you equal him

What think you of my favourite clan
Robin and Jack , and Jack and Dan

Fellows of modest worth and parts
With cheerful looks and honest hearts

Can you on Dublin look with scorn
Yet here were you and Ormond born

O ! were but you and I so wise
To see with Robert Grattan 's eyes

Robin adores that spot of earth
That literal spot which gave him birth

And swears , `` Belcamp is , to his taste
As fine as Hampton-court at least

When to your friends you would enhance
The praise of Italy or France

For grandeur , elegance , and wit
We gladly hear you , and submit

But then , to come and keep a clutter
For this or that side of a gutter

To live in this or t'other isle
We can not think it worth your while

For , take it kindly or amiss
The difference but amounts to this

We bury on our side the channel
In linen ; and on yours in flannel

You for the news are ne'er to seek
While we , perhaps , may wait a week

You happy folks are sure to meet
A hundred whores in every street

While we may trace all Dublin o'er
Before we find out half a score

You see my arguments are strong
I wonder you held out so long

But , since you are convinced at last
We 'll pardon you for what has past

So -- let us now for whist prepare
Twelve pence a corner , if you dare

THOSE dreams , that on the silent night intrude
And with false flitting shades our minds delude

Jove never sends us downward from the skies
Nor can they from infernal mansions rise

But are all mere productions of the brain
And fools consult interpreters in vain

For when in bed we rest our weary limbs
The mind unburden 'd sports in various whims

The busy head with mimic art runs o'er
The scenes and actions of the day before

The drowsy tyrant , by his minions led
To regal rage devotes some patriot 's head

With equal terrors , not with equal guilt
The murderer dreams of all the blood he spilt

The soldier smiling hears the widow 's cries
And stabs the son before the mother 's eyes

With like remorse his brother of the trade
The butcher , fells the lamb beneath his blade

The statesman rakes the town to find a plot
And dreams of forfeitures by treason got

Nor less Tom-t -- d-man , of true statesman mould
Collects the city filth in search of gold

Orphans around his bed the lawyer sees
And takes the plaintiff 's and defendant 's fees

His fellow pick-purse , watching for a job
Fancies his fingers in the cully 's fob

The kind physician grants the husband 's prayers
Or gives relief to long-expecting heirs

The sleeping hangman ties the fatal noose
Nor unsuccessful waits for dead men 's shoes

The grave divine , with knotty points perplext
As if he were awake , nods o'er his text

While the sly mountebank attends his trade
Harangues the rabble , and is better paid

The hireling senator of modern days
Bedaubs the guilty great with nauseous praise

And Dick , the scavenger , with equal grace
Flirts from his cart the mud in Walpole 's face

Dear Sir , I think , 't is doubly hard
Your ears and doors should both be barred

Can anything be more unkind
Must I not see , 'cause you are blind

Methinks a friend at night should cheer you
A friend that loves to see and hear you

Why am I robb 'd of that delight
When you can be no loser by't

Nay , when 't is plain ( for what is plainer
That if you heard you 'd be no gainer

For sure you are not yet to learn
That hearing is not your concern

Then be your doors no longer barred
Your business , sir , is to be heard

The wise pretend to make it clear
'T is no great loss to lose an ear

Why are we then so fond of two
When by experience one would do

'T is true , say they , cut off the head
And there 's an end ; the man is dead

Because , among all human race
None e'er was known to have a brace

But confidently they maintain
That where we find the members twain

The loss of one is no such trouble
Since t'other will in strength be double

The limb surviving , you may swear
Becomes his brother 's lawful heir

Thus , for a trial , let me beg of
Your reverence but to cut one leg off

And you shall find , by this device
The other will be stronger twice

For every day you shall be gaining
New vigour to the leg remaining

So , when an eye has lost its brother
You see the better with the other

Cut off your hand , and you may do
With t'other hand the work of two

Because the soul her power contracts
And on the brother limb reacts

But yet the point is not so clear in
Another case , the sense of hearing

For , though the place of either ear
Be distant , as one head can bear

Yet Galen most acutely shows you
( Consult his book _de partium usu_

That from each ear , as he observes
There creep two auditory nerves

Not to be seen without a glass
Which near the _os petrosum_ pass

Thence to the neck ; and moving thorough there
One goes to this , and one to t'other ear

Which made my grandam always stuff her ears
Both right and left , as fellow-sufferers

You see my learning ; but , to shorten it
When my left ear was deaf a fortnight

To t'other ear I felt it coming on
And thus I solve this hard phenomenon

'T is true , a glass will bring supplies
To weak , or old , or clouded eyes

Your arms , though both your eyes were lost
Would guard your nose against a post

Without your legs , two legs of wood
Are stronger , and almost as good

And as for hands , there have been those
Who , wanting both , have used their toes

But no contrivance yet appears
To furnish artificial ears

NELL scolded in so loud a din
That Will durst hardly venture in

He mark 'd the conjugal dispute
Nell roar 'd incessant , Dick sat mute

But , when he saw his friend appear
Cried bravely , `` Patience , good my dear

At sight of Will she bawl 'd no more
But hurried out and clapt the door

Why , Dick ! the devil 's in thy Nell
( Quoth Will , ) thy house is worse than Hell

Why what a peal the jade has rung
D -- n her , why do n't you slit her tongue

For nothing else will make it cease
Dear Will , I suffer this for peace

I never quarrel with my wife
I bear it for a quiet life

Scripture , you know , exhorts us to it
Bids us to seek peace , and ensue it

Will went again to visit Dick
And entering in the very nick

He saw virago Nell belabour
With Dick 's own staff , his peaceful neighbour

Poor Will , who needs must interpose
Received a brace or two of blows

But now , to make my story short
Will drew out Dick to take a quart

Why , Dick , thy wife has devilish whims
Ods-buds ! why do n't you break her limbs

If she were mine , and had such tricks
I 'd teach her how to handle sticks

Z -- ds ! I would ship her to Jamaica
Or truck the carrion for tobacco

I 'd send her far enough away
Dear Will ; but what would people say

Lord ! I should get so ill a name
The neighbours round would cry out shame

Dick suffer 'd for his peace and credit
But who believed him when he said it

Can he , who makes himself a slave
Consult his peace , or credit save

Dick found it by his ill success
His quiet small , his credit less

She served him at the usual rate
She stunn 'd , and then she broke his pate

And what he thought the hardest case
The parish jeer 'd him to his face

Those men who wore the breeches least
Call 'd him a cuckold , fool , and beast

At home he was pursued with noise
Abroad was pester 'd by the boys

Within , his wife would break his bones
Without , they pelted him with stones

The 'prentices procured a riding
To act his patience and her chiding

False patience and mistaken pride
There are ten thousand Dicks beside

Slaves to their quiet and good name
Are used like Dick , and bear the blame

In spight of Pope , in spight of Gay
And all that he or they can say

Sing on I must , and sing I will
Of Richmond Lodge and Marble Hill

Last Friday night , as neighbours use
This couple met to talk of news

For , by old proverbs , it appears
That walls have tongues , and hedges ears

Quoth Marble Hill , right well I ween
Your mistress now is grown a queen

You 'll find it soon by woful proof
She 'll come no more beneath your roof

The kingly prophet well evinces
That we should put no trust in princes

My royal master promised me
To raise me to a high degree

But now he 's grown a king , God wot
I fear I shall be soon forgot

You see , when folks have got their ends
How quickly they neglect their friends

Yet I may say , 'twixt me and you
Pray God , they now may find as true

My house was built but for a show
My lady 's empty pockets know

And now she will not have a shilling
To raise the stairs , or build the ceiling

For all the courtly madams round
Now pay four shillings in the pound

'T is come to what I always thought
My dame is hardly worth a groat

Had you and I been courtiers born
We should not thus have lain forlorn

For those we dext'rous courtiers call
Can rise upon their masters ' fall

But we , unlucky and unwise
Must fall because our masters rise

My master , scarce a fortnight since
Was grown as wealthy as a prince

But now it will be no such thing
For he 'll be poor as any king

And by his crown will nothing get
But like a king to run in debt

No more the Dean , that grave divine
Shall keep the key of my ( no ) wine

My ice-house rob , as heretofore
And steal my artichokes no more

Poor Patty Blount no more be seen
Bedraggled in my walks so green

Plump Johnny Gay will now elope
And here no more will dangle Pope

Here wont the Dean , when he 's to seek
To spunge a breakfast once a-week

To cry the bread was stale , and mutter
Complaints against the royal butter

But now I fear it will be said
No butter sticks upon his bread

We soon shall find him full of spleen
For want of tattling to the queen

Stunning her royal ears with talking
His reverence and her highness walking

While Lady Charlotte , like a stroller
Sits mounted on the garden-roller

A goodly sight to see her ride
With ancient Mirmont at her side

In velvet cap his head lies warm
His hat , for show , beneath his arm

Some South-Sea broker from the city
Will purchase me , the more 's the pity

Lay all my fine plantations waste
To fit them to his vulgar taste

Chang 'd for the worse in ev'ry part
My master Pope will break his heart

In my own Thames may I be drownded
If e'er I stoop beneath a crown 'd head

Except her majesty prevails
To place me with the Prince of Wales

And then I shall be free from fears
For he 'll be prince these fifty years

I then will turn a courtier too
And serve the times as others do

Plain loyalty , not built on hope
I leave to your contriver , Pope

None loves his king and country better
Yet none was ever less their debtor

Then let him come and take a nap
In summer on my verdant lap

Prefer our villas , where the Thames is
To Kensington , or hot St. James 's

Nor shall I dull in silence sit
For 't is to me he owes his wit

My groves , my echoes , and my birds
Have taught him his poetic words

We gardens , and you wildernesses
Assist all poets in distresses

Him twice a-week I here expect
To rattle Moody for neglect

An idle rogue , who spends his quartridge
In tippling at the Dog and Partridge

And I can hardly get him down
Three times a-week to brush my gown

I pity you , dear Marble Hill
But hope to see you flourish still

All happiness -- and so adieu
Kind Richmond Lodge , the same to you

'T is strange what different thoughts inspire
In men , Possession and Desire

Think what they wish so great a blessing
So disappointed when possessing

A moralist profoundly sage
( I know not in what book or page

Or whether o'er a pot of ale
Related thus the following tale

Possession , and Desire , his brother
But still at variance with each other

Were seen contending in a race
And kept at first an equal pace

'T is said , their course continued long
For this was active , that was strong

Till Envy , Slander , Sloth , and Doubt
Misled them many a league about

Seduced by some deceiving light
They take the wrong way for the right

Through slippery by-roads , dark and deep
They often climb , and often creep

Desire , the swifter of the two
Along the plain like lightning flew

Till , entering on a broad highway
Where power and titles scatter 'd lay

He strove to pick up all he found
And by excursions lost his ground

No sooner got , than with disdain
He threw them on the ground again

And hasted forward to pursue
Fresh objects , fairer to his view

In hope to spring some nobler game
But all he took was just the same

Too scornful now to stop his pace
He spurn 'd them in his rival 's face

Possession kept the beaten road
And gather 'd all his brother strewed

But overcharged , and out of wind
Though strong in limbs , he lagg 'd behind

Desire had now the goal in sight
It was a tower of monstrous height

Where on the summit Fortune stands
A crown and sceptre in her hands

Beneath , a chasm as deep as Hell
Where many a bold adventurer fell

Desire , in rapture , gazed awhile
And saw the treacherous goddess smile

But as he climb 'd to grasp the crown
She knock 'd him with the sceptre down

He tumbled in the gulf profound
There doom 'd to whirl an endless round

Possession 's load was grown so great
He sunk beneath the cumbrous weight

And , as he now expiring lay
Flocks every ominous bird of prey

The raven , vulture , owl , and kite
At once upon his carcass light

And strip his hide , and pick his bones
Regardless of his dying groans

Ye wise , instruct me to endure
An evil , which admits no cure

Or , how this evil can be borne
Which breeds at once both hate and scorn

Bare innocence is no support
When you are tried in Scandal 's court

Stand high in honour , wealth , or wit
All others , who inferior sit

Conceive themselves in conscience bound
To join , and drag you to the ground

Your altitude offends the eyes
Of those who want the power to rise

The world , a willing stander-by
Inclines to aid a specious lie

Alas ! they would not do you wrong
But all appearances are strong

Yet whence proceeds this weight we lay
On what detracting people say

For let mankind discharge their tongues
In venom , till they burst their lungs

Their utmost malice can not make
Your head , or tooth , or finger ache

Nor spoil your shape , distort your face
Or put one feature out of place

Nor will you find your fortune sink
By what they speak or what they think

Nor can ten hundred thousand lies
Make you less virtuous , learn 'd , or wise

The most effectual way to balk
Their malice , is -- to let them talk

A set of phrases learn 'd by rote
A passion for a scarlet coat

When at a play , to laugh or cry
Yet can not tell the reason why

Never to hold her tongue a minute
While all she prates has nothing in it

Whole hours can with a coxcomb sit
And take his nonsense all for wit

Her learning mounts to read a song
But half the words pronouncing wrong

Has every repartee in store
She spoke ten thousand times before

Can ready compliments supply
On all occasions cut and dry

Such hatred to a parson 's gown
The sight would put her in a swoon

For conversation well endued
She calls it witty to be rude

And , placing raillery in railing
Will tell aloud your greatest failing

Nor make a scruple to expose
Your bandy leg , or crooked nose

Can at her morning tea run o'er
The scandal of the day before

Improving hourly in her skill
To cheat and wrangle at quadrille

In choosing lace , a critic nice
Knows to a groat the lowest price

Can in her female clubs dispute
What linen best the silk will suit

What colours each complexion match
And where with art to place a patch

If chance a mouse creeps in her sight
Can finely counterfeit a fright

So sweetly screams , if it comes near her
She ravishes all hearts to hear her

Can dext'rously her husband teaze
By taking fits whene'er she please

By frequent practice learns the trick
At proper seasons to be sick

Thinks nothing gives one airs so pretty
At once creating love and pity

If Molly happens to be careless
And but neglects to warm her hair-lace

She gets a cold as sure as death
And vows she scarce can fetch her breath

Admires how modest women can
Be so robustious like a man

In party , furious to her power
A bitter Whig , or Tory sour

Her arguments directly tend
Against the side she would defend

Will prove herself a Tory plain
From principles the Whigs maintain

And , to defend the Whiggish cause
Her topics from the Tories draws

O yes ! if any man can find
More virtues in a woman 's mind

Let them be sent to Mrs. Harding
She 'll pay the charges to a farthing

Take notice , she has my commission
To add them in the next edition

They may outsell a better thing
So , holla , boys ; God save the King

As clever Tom Clinch , while the rabble was bawling
Rode stately through Holborn to die in his calling

He stopt at the George for a bottle of sack
And promised to pay for it when he came back

His waistcoat , and stockings , and breeches , were white
His cap had a new cherry ribbon to tie't

The maids to the doors and the balconies ran
And said , `` Lack-a-day , he 's a proper young man

But , as from the windows the ladies he spied
Like a beau in the box , he bow 'd low on each side

And when his last speech the loud hawkers did cry
He swore from his cart , `` It was all a damn 'd lie

The hangman for pardon fell down on his knee
Tom gave him a kick in the guts for his fee

Then said , I must speak to the people a little
But I 'll see you all damn 'd before I will whittle

My honest friend Wild ( may he long hold his place
He lengthen 'd my life with a whole year of grace

Take courage , dear comrades , and be not afraid
Nor slip this occasion to follow your trade

My conscience is clear , and my spirits are calm
And thus I go off , without prayer-book or psalm

Then follow the practice of clever Tom Clinch
Who hung like a hero , and never would flinch

By poets we are well assured
That love , alas ! can ne'er be cured

A complicated heap of ills
Despising boluses and pills

Ah ! Chloe , this I find is true
Since first I gave my heart to you

Now , by your cruelty hard bound
I strain my guts , my colon wound

Now jealousy my grumbling tripes
Assaults with grating , grinding gripes

When pity in those eyes I view
My bowels wambling make me spew

When I an amorous kiss designed
I belch 'd a hurricane of wind

Once you a gentle sigh let fall
Remember how I suck 'd it all

What colic pangs from thence I felt
Had you but known , your heart would melt

Like ruffling winds in cavern pent
Till Nature pointed out a vent

How have you torn my heart to pieces
With maggots , humours , and caprices

By which I got the hemorrhoids
And loathsome worms my _anus_ voids

Whene'er I hear a rival named
I feel my body all inflamed

Which , breaking out in boils and blains
With yellow filth my linen stains

Or , parch 'd with unextinguish 'd thirst
Small-beer I guzzle till I burst

And then I drag a bloated _corpus_
Swell 'd with a dropsy , like a porpus

When , if I can not purge or stale
I must be tapp 'd to fill a pail

Now the active young attorneys
Briskly travel on their journeys

Looking big as any giants
On the horses of their clients

Like so many little Marses
With their tilters at their a -- s

Brazen-hilted , lately burnished
And with harness-buckles furnished

And with whips and spurs so neat
And with jockey-coats complete

And with boots so very greasy
And with saddles eke so easy

And with bridles fine and gay
Bridles borrow 'd for a day

Bridles destined far to roam
Ah ! never , never to come home

And with hats so very big , sir
And with powder 'd caps and wigs , sir

And with ruffles to be shown
Cambric ruffles not their own

And with Holland shirts so white
Shirts becoming to the sight

Shirts bewrought with different letters
As belonging to their betters

With their pretty tinsel 'd boxes
Gotten from their dainty doxies

And with rings so very trim
Lately taken out of lim

And with very little pence
And as very little sense

With some law , but little justice
Having stolen from my hostess

From the barber and the cutler
Like the soldier from the sutler

From the vintner and the tailor
Like the felon from the jailor

Into this and t'other county
Living on the public bounty

Thorough town and thorough village
All to plunder , all to pillage

Thorough mountains , thorough valleys
Thorough stinking lanes and alleys

Some to -- kiss with farmers ' spouses
And make merry in their houses

Some to tumble country wenches
On their rushy beds and benches

And if they begin a fray
Draw their swords , and -- -- run away

All to murder equity
And to take a double fee

Till the people are all quiet
And forget to broil and riot

Low in pocket , cow 'd in courage
Safely glad to sup their porridge

And vacation 's over -- then
Hey , for London town again

SIR , 't was a most unfriendly part
In you , who ought to know my heart

Are well acquainted with my zeal
For all the female commonweal

How could it come into your mind
To pitch on me , of all mankind

Against the sex to write a satire
And brand me for a woman-hater

On me , who think them all so fair
They rival Venus to a hair

Their virtues never ceased to sing
Since first I learn 'd to tune a string

Methinks I hear the ladies cry
Will he his character belie

Must never our misfortunes end
And have we lost our only friend

Ah , lovely nymphs ! remove your fears
No more let fall those precious tears

The hound be hunted by the hare
Than I turn rebel to the fair

'T was you engaged me first to write
Then gave the subject out of spite

The journal of a modern dame
Is , by my promise , what you claim

My word is past , I must submit
And yet perhaps you may be bit

I but transcribe ; for not a line
Of all the satire shall be mine

Compell 'd by you to tag in rhymes
The common slanders of the times

Of modern times , the guilt is yours
And me my innocence secures

Unwilling Muse , begin thy lay
The annals of a female day

By nature turn 'd to play the rake well
( As we shall show you in the sequel

The modern dame is waked by noon
( Some authors say not quite so soon

Because , though sore against her will
She sat all night up at quadrille

She stretches , gapes , unglues her eyes
And asks if it be time to rise

Of headache and the spleen complains
And then , to cool her heated brains

Her night-gown and her slippers brought her
Takes a large dram of citron water

Then to her glass ; and , `` Betty , pray
Do n't I look frightfully to-day

But was it not confounded hard
Well , if I ever touch a card

Four matadores , and lose codille
Depend upo n't , I never will

But run to Tom , and bid him fix
The ladies here to-night by six

`` Madam , the goldsmith waits below
He says , his business is to know

If you 'll redeem the silver cup
He keeps in pawn ? '' -- '' Why , show him up

`` Your dressing-plate he 'll be content
To take , for interest _cent . per cent._

And , madam , there 's my Lady Spade
Has sent this letter by her maid

`` Well , I remember what she won
And has she sent so soon to dun

Here , carry down these ten pistoles
My husband left to pay for coals

I thank my stars they all are light
And I may have revenge to-night

Now , loitering o'er her tea and cream
She enters on her usual theme

Her last night 's ill success repeats
Calls Lady Spade a hundred cheats

`` She slipt spadillo in her breast
Then thought to turn it to a jest

There 's Mrs. Cut and she combine
And to each other give the sign

Through every game pursues her tale
Like hunters o'er their evening ale

Now to another scene give place
Enter the folks with silks and lace

Fresh matter for a world of chat
Right Indian this , right Mechlin that

`` Observe this pattern -- there 's a stuff
I can have customers enough

Dear madam , you are grown so hard
This lace is worth twelve pounds a-yard

Madam , if there be truth in man
I never sold so cheap a fan

This business of importance o'er
And madam almost dress 'd by four

The footman , in his usual phrase
Comes up with , `` Madam , dinner stays

She answers , in her usual style
`` The cook must keep it back a while

I never can have time to dress
No woman breathing takes up less

I 'm hurried so , it makes me sick
I wish the dinner at Old Nick

At table now she acts her part
Has all the dinner cant by heart

`` I thought we were to dine alone
My dear ; for sure , if I had known

This company would come to-day
But really 't is my spouse 's way

He 's so unkind , he never sends
To tell when he invites his friends

I wish ye may but have enough
And while with all this paltry stuff

She sits tormenting every guest
Nor gives her tongue one moment 's rest

In phrases batter 'd , stale , and trite
Which modern ladies call polite

You see the booby husband sit
In admiration at her wit

But let me now a while survey
Our madam o'er her evening tea

Surrounded with her noisy clans
Of prudes , coquettes , and harridans

When , frighted at the clamorous crew
Away the God of Silence flew

And fair Discretion left the place
And modesty with blushing face

Now enters overweening Pride
And Scandal , ever gaping wide

Hypocrisy with frown severe
Scurrility with gibing air

Rude laughter seeming like to burst
And Malice always judging worst

And Vanity with pocket glass
And Impudence with front of brass

And studied Affectation came
Each limb and feature out of frame

While Ignorance , with brain of lead
Flew hovering o'er each female head

Why should I ask of thee , my Muse
A hundred tongues , as poets use

When , to give every dame her due
A hundred thousand were too few

Or how should I , alas ! relate
The sum of all their senseless prate

Their innuendoes , hints , and slanders
Their meanings lewd , and double entendres

Now comes the general scandal charge
What some invent , the rest enlarge

And , `` Madam , if it be a lie
You have the tale as cheap as I

I must conceal my author 's name
But now 't is known to common fame

Say , foolish females , bold and blind
Say , by what fatal turn of mind

Are you on vices most severe
Wherein yourselves have greatest share

Thus every fool herself deludes
The prude condemns the absent prudes

Mopsa , who stinks her spouse to death
Accuses Chloe 's tainted breath

Hircina , rank with sweat , presumes
To censure Phyllis for perfumes

While crooked Cynthia , sneering , says
That Florimel wears iron stays

Chloe , of every coxcomb jealous
Admires how girls can talk with fellows

And , full of indignation , frets
That women should be such coquettes

Iris , for scandal most notorious
Cries , `` Lord , the world is so censorious

And Rufa , with her combs of lead
Whispers that Sappho 's hair is red

Aura , whose tongue you hear a mile hence
Talks half a day in praise of silence

And Sylvia , full of inward guilt
Calls Amoret an arrant jilt

Now voices over voices rise
While each to be the loudest vies

They contradict , affirm , dispute
No single tongue one moment mute

All mad to speak , and none to hearken
They set the very lap-dog barking

Their chattering makes a louder din
Than fishwives o'er a cup of gin

Not schoolboys at a barring out
Raised ever such incessant rout

The jumbling particles of matter
In chaos made not such a clatter

Far less the rabble roar and rail
When drunk with sour election ale

Nor do they trust their tongues alone
But speak a language of their own

Can read a nod , a shrug , a look
Far better than a printed book

Convey a libel in a frown
And wink a reputation down

Or by the tossing of the fan
Describe the lady and the man

But see , the female club disbands
Each twenty visits on her hands

Now all alone poor madam sits
In vapours and hysteric fits

`` And was not Tom this morning sent
I 'd lay my life he never went

Past six , and not a living soul
I might by this have won a vole

A dreadful interval of spleen
How shall we pass the time between

`` Here , Betty , let me take my drops
And feel my pulse , I know it stops

This head of mine , lord , how it swims
And such a pain in all my limbs

`` Dear madam , try to take a nap
But now they hear a footman 's rap

`` Go , run , and light the ladies up
It must be one before we sup

The table , cards , and counters , set
And all the gamester ladies met

Her spleen and fits recover 'd quite
Our madam can sit up all night

`` Whoever comes , I 'm not within
Quadrille 's the word , and so begin

How can the Muse her aid impart
Unskill 'd in all the terms of art

Or in harmonious numbers put
The deal , the shuffle , and the cut

The superstitious whims relate
That fill a female gamester 's pate

What agony of soul she feels
To see a knave 's inverted heels

She draws up card by card , to find
Good fortune peeping from behind

With panting heart , and earnest eyes
In hope to see spadillo rise

In vain , alas ! her hope is fed
She draws an ace , and sees it red

In ready counters never pays
But pawns her snuff-box , rings , and keys

Ever with some new fancy struck
Tries twenty charms to mend her luck

`` This morning , when the parson came
I said I should not win a game

This odious chair , how came I stuck i n't
I think I never had good luck i n't

I 'm so uneasy in my stays
Your fan , a moment , if you please

Stand farther , girl , or get you gone
I always lose when you look on

`` Lord ! madam , you have lost codille
I never saw you play so ill

`` Nay , madam , give me leave to say
'T was you that threw the game away

When Lady Tricksey play 'd a four
You took it with a matadore

I saw you touch your wedding ring
Before my lady call 'd a king

You spoke a word began with H
And I know whom you meant to teach

Because you held the king of hearts
Fie , madam , leave these little arts

`` That 's not so bad as one that rubs
Her chair to call the king of clubs

And makes her partner understand
A matadore is in her hand

`` Madam , you have no cause to flounce
I swear I saw you thrice renounce

`` And truly , madam , I know when
Instead of five you scored me ten

Spadillo here has got a mark
A child may know it in the dark

I guess 'd the hand : it seldom fails
I wish some folks would pare their nails

While thus they rail , and scold , and storm
It passes but for common form

But , conscious that they all speak true
And give each other but their due

It never interrupts the game
Or makes them sensible of shame

The time too precious now to waste
The supper gobbled up in haste

Again afresh to cards they run
As if they had but just begun

But I shall not again repeat
How oft they squabble , snarl , and cheat

At last they hear the watchman knock
`` A frosty morn -- past four o'clock

The chairmen are not to be found
`` Come , let us play the other round

Now all in haste they huddle on
Their hoods , their cloaks , and get them gone

But , first , the winner must invite
The company to-morrow night

Unlucky madam , left in tears
( Who now again quadrille forswears

With empty purse , and aching head
Steals to her sleeping spouse to bed

Logicians have but ill defined
As rational , the human kind

Reason , they say , belongs to man
But let them prove it if they can

Wise Aristotle and Smiglesius
By ratiocinations specious

Have strove to prove , with great precision
With definition and division

_Homo est ratione praeditum
But for my soul I can not credit 'em

And must , in spite of them , maintain
That man and all his ways are vain

And that this boasted lord of nature
Is both a weak and erring creature

That instinct is a surer guide
Than reason , boasting mortals ' pride

And that brute beasts are far before 'em
_Deus est anima brutorum._

Whoever knew an honest brute
At law his neighbour prosecute

Bring action for assault or battery
Or friend beguile with lies and flattery

O'er plains they ramble unconfined
No politics disturb their mind

They eat their meals , and take their sport
Nor know who 's in or out at court

They never to the levee go
To treat , as dearest friend , a foe

They never importune his grace
Nor ever cringe to men in place

Nor undertake a dirty job
Nor draw the quill to write for Bob

Fraught with invective , they ne'er go
To folks at Paternoster Row

No judges , fiddlers , dancing-masters
No pickpockets , or poetasters

Are known to honest quadrupeds
No single brute his fellow leads

Brutes never meet in bloody fray
Nor cut each other 's throats for pay

Of beasts , it is confess 'd , the ape
Comes nearest us in human shape

Like man , he imitates each fashion
And malice is his lurking passion

But , both in malice and grimaces
A courtier any ape surpasses

Behold him , humbly cringing , wait
Upon the minister of state

View him soon after to inferiors
Aping the conduct of superiors

He promises with equal air
And to perform takes equal care

He in his turn finds imitators
At court , the porters , lacqueys , waiters

Their masters ' manner still contract
And footmen , lords and dukes can act

Thus , at the court , both great and small
Behave alike , for all ape all

Ere bribes convince you whom to choose
The precepts of Lord Coke peruse

Observe an elephant , says he
And let him like your member be

First take a man that 's free from _Gaul_
For elephants have none at all

In flocks or parties he must keep
For elephants live just like sheep

Stubborn in honour he must be
For elephants ne'er bend the knee

Last , let his memory be sound
In which your elephant 's profound

That old examples from the wise
May prompt him in his noes and ayes

Thus the Lord Coke hath gravely writ
In all the form of lawyer 's wit

And then , with Latin and all that
Shows the comparison is pat

Yet in some points my lord is wrong
One 's teeth are sold , and t'other 's tongue

Now , men of parliament , God knows
Are more like elephants of shows

Whose docile memory and sense
Are turn 'd to trick , to gather pence

To get their master half-a-crown
They spread the flag , or lay it down

Those who bore bulwarks on their backs
And guarded nations from attacks

Now practise every pliant gesture
Opening their trunk for every tester

Siam , for elephants so famed
Is not with England to be named

Their elephants by men are sold
Ours sell themselves , and take the gold

Lindsay mistakes the matter quite
And honest Paulus judges right

Then , why these quarrels to the sun
Without whose aid you 're all undone

Did Paulus e'er complain of sweat
Did Paulus e'er the sun forget

The influence of whose golden beams
Soon licks up all unsavoury steams

The sun , you say , his face has kissed
It has ; but then it greased his fist

True lawyers , for the wisest ends
Have always been Apollo 's friends

Not for his superficial powers
Of ripening fruits , and gilding flowers

Not for inspiring poets ' brains
With penniless and starveling strains

Not for his boasted healing art
Not for his skill to shoot the dart

Nor yet because he sweetly fiddles
Nor for his prophecies in riddles

But for a more substantial cause
Apollo 's patron of the laws

Whom Paulus ever must adore
As parent of the golden ore

By Phoebus , an incestuous birth
Begot upon his grandam Earth

By Phoebus first produced to light
By Vulcan form 'd so round and bright

Then offer 'd at the shrine of Justice
By clients to her priests and trustees

Nor , when we see Astraea stand
With even balance in her hand

Must we suppose she has in view
How to give every man his due

Her scales you see her only hold
To weigh her priests ' the lawyers ' gold

Now , should I own your case was grievous
Poor sweaty Paulus , who 'd believe us

'T is very true , and none denies
At least , that such complaints are wise

'T is wise , no doubt , as clients fat you more
To cry , like statesmen , _Quanta patimur

But , since the truth must needs be stretched
To prove that lawyers are so wretched

This paradox I 'll undertake
For Paulus ' and for Lindsay 's sake

By topics , which , though I abomine 'em
May serve as arguments _ad hominem_

Yet I disdain to offer those
Made use of by detracting foes

I own the curses of mankind
Sit light upon a lawyer 's mind

The clamours of ten thousand tongues
Break not his rest , nor hurt his lungs

I own , his conscience always free
( Provided he has got his fee

Secure of constant peace within
He knows no guilt , who knows no sin

Yet well they merit to be pitied
By clients always overwitted

And though the gospel seems to say
What heavy burdens lawyers lay

Upon the shoulders of their neighbour
Nor lend a finger to their labour

Always for saving their own bacon
No doubt , the text is here mistaken

The copy 's false , the sense is racked
To prove it , I appeal to fact

And thus by demonstration show
What burdens lawyers undergo

With early clients at his door
Though he was drunk the night before

And crop-sick , with unclubb'd-for wine
The wretch must be at court by nine

Half sunk beneath his briefs and bag
As ridden by a midnight hag

Then , from the bar , harangues the bench
In English vile , and viler French

And Latin , vilest of the three
And all for poor ten moidores fee

Of paper how is he profuse
With periods long , in terms abstruse

What pains he takes to be prolix
A thousand lines to stand for six

Of common sense without a word in
And is not this a grievous burden

The lawyer is a common drudge
To fight our cause before the judge

And , what is yet a greater curse
Condemn 'd to bear his client 's purse

While he at ease , secure and light
Walks boldly home at dead of night

When term is ended , leaves the town
Trots to his country mansion down

And , disencumber 'd of his load
No danger dreads upon the road

Despises rapparees , and rides
Safe through the Newry mountains ' sides

Lindsay , 't is you have set me on
To state this question _pro_ and _con_

My satire may offend , 't is true
However , it concerns not you

I own , there may , in every clan
Perhaps , be found one honest man

Yet link them close , in this they jump
To be but rascals in the lump

Imagine Lindsay at the bar
He 's much the same his brethren are

Well taught by practice to imbibe
The fundamentals of his tribe

And in his client 's just defence
Must deviate oft from common sense

And make his ignorance discerned
To get the name of counsel-learned

( As _lucus_ comes _a non lucendo_
And wisely do as other men do

But shift him to a better scene
Among his crew of rogues in grain

Surrounded with companions fit
To taste his humour , sense , and wit

You 'd swear he never took a fee
Nor knew in law his A , B , C

'T is hard , where dulness overrules
To keep good sense in crowds of fools

And we admire the man , who saves
His honesty in crowds of knaves

Nor yields up virtue at discretion
To villains of his own profession

Lindsay , you know what pains you take
In both , yet hardly save your stake

And will you venture both anew
To sit among that venal crew

That pack of mimic legislators
Abandon 'd , stupid , slavish praters

For as the rabble daub and rifle
The fool who scrambles for a trifle

Who for his pains is cuff 'd and kicked
Drawn through the dirt , his pockets picked

You must expect the like disgrace
Scrambling with rogues to get a place

Must lose the honour you have gained
Your numerous virtues foully stained

Disclaim for ever all pretence
To common honesty and sense

And join in friendship with a strict tie
To M -- l , C -- y , and Dick Tighe

Since there are persons who complain
There 's too much satire in my vein

That I am often found exceeding
The rules of raillery and breeding

With too much freedom treat my betters
Not sparing even men of letters

You , who are skill 'd in lawyers ' lore
What 's your advice ? Shall I give o'er

Nor ever fools or knaves expose
Either in verse or humorous prose

And to avoid all future ill
In my scrutoire lock up my quill

Since you are pleased to condescend
To ask the judgment of a friend

Your case consider 'd , I must think
You should withdraw from pen and ink

Forbear your poetry and jokes
And live like other Christian folks

Or if the Muses must inspire
Your fancy with their pleasing fire

Take subjects safer for your wit
Than those on which you lately writ

Commend the times , your thoughts correct
And follow the prevailing sect

Assert that Hyde , in writing story
Shows all the malice of a Tory

While Burnet , in his deathless page
Discovers freedom without rage

To Woolston recommend our youth
For learning , probity , and truth

That noble genius , who unbinds
The chains which fetter freeborn minds

Redeems us from the slavish fears
Which lasted near two thousand years

He can alone the priesthood humble
Make gilded spires and altars tumble

Must I commend against my conscience
Such stupid blasphemy and nonsense

To such a subject tune my lyre
And sing like one of Milton 's choir

Where devils to a vale retreat
And call the laws of Wisdom , Fate

Lament upon their hapless fall
That Force free Virtue should enthrall

Or shall the charms of Wealth and Power
Make me pollute the Muses ' bower

The land and water
Rise up and scatter

The dew that covers
The print of last night 's lovers

THE dim sea glints chill . The white sun is shy
And the skeleton weeds and the never-dry

Rough , long grasses keep white with frost
At the hilltop by the finger-post

The smoke of the traveller's-joy is puffed
Over hawthorn berry and hazel tuft

I read the sign . Which way shall I go
A voice says : You would not have doubted so

At twenty . Another voice gentle with scorn
Says : At twenty you wished you had never been born

One hazel lost a leaf of gold
From a tuft at the tip , when the first voice told

The other he wished to know what 'twould be
To be sixty by this same post . `` You shall see

He laughed -- and I had to join his laughter
`` You shall see ; but either before or after

Whatever happens , it must befall
A mouthful of earth to remedy all

Regrets and wishes shall freely be given
And if there be a flaw in that heaven

'Twill be freedom to wish , and your wish may be
To be here or anywhere talking to me

No matter what the weather , on earth
At any age between death and birth

To see what day or night can be
The sun and the frost , the land and the sea

Summer , Autumn , Winter , Spring
With a poor man of any sort , down to a king

Standing upright out in the air
Wondering where he shall journey , O where

UNDER the after-sunset sky
Two pewits sport and cry

More white than is the moon on high
Riding the dark surge silently

More black than earth . Their cry
Is the one sound under the sky

They alone move , now low , now high
And merrily they cry

To the mischievous Spring sky
Plunging earthward , tossing high

Over the ghost who wonders why
So merrily they cry and fly

Nor choose 'twixt earth and sky
While the moon 's quarter silently

WILL you come
Will you come

Will you come
Will you come

Would you come
Would you come

Would you have come
Would you have come

If you come
Haste and come

OVER the land freckled with snow half-thawed
The speculating rooks at their nests cawed

And saw from elm-tops , delicate as flower of grass
What we below could not see , Winter pass

IF I should ever by chance grow rich
I 'll buy Codham , Cockridden , and Childerditch

Roses , Pyrgo , and Lapwater
And let them all to my elder daughter

The rent I shall ask of her will be only
Each year 's first violets , white and lonely

The first primroses and orchises
She must find them before I do , that is

But if she finds a blossom on furze
Without rent they shall all for ever be hers

IF I were to own this countryside
As far as a man in a day could ride

And the Tyes were mine for giving or letting
Wingle Tye and Margaretting

Tye , -- and Skreens , Gooshays , and Cockerells
Shellow , Rochetts , Bandish , and Pickerells

Marlins , Lambkins , and Lillyputs
Their copses , ponds , roads , and ruts

Fields where plough-horses steam and plovers
Fling and whimper , hedges that lovers

Love , and orchards , shrubberies , walls
Where the sun untroubled by north wind falls

And single trees where the thrush sings well
His proverbs untranslatable

I would give them all to my son
If he would let me any one

For a song , a blackbird 's song , at dawn
He should have no more , till on my lawn

Never a one was left , because I
Had shot them to put them into a pie

His Essex blackbirds , every one
And I was left old and alone

Then unless I could pay , for rent , a song
As sweet as a blackbird 's , and as long

No more -- he should have the house , not I
Margaretting or Wingle Tye

Or it might be Skreens , Gooshays , or Cockerells
Shellow , Rochetts , Bandish , or Pickerells

Martins , Lambkins , or Lillyputs
Should be his till the cart tracks had no ruts

AND you , Helen , what should I give you
So many things I would give you

Had I an infinite great store
Offered me and I stood before

To choose . I would give you youth
All kinds of loveliness and truth

A clear eye as good as mine
Lands , waters , flowers , wine

As many children as your heart
Might wish for , a far better art

Than mine can be , all you have lost
Upon the travelling waters tossed

Or given to me . If I could choose
Freely in that great treasure-house

Anything from any shelf
I would give you back yourself

And power to discriminate
What you want and want it not too late

Many fair days free from care
And heart to enjoy both foul and fair

And myself , too , if I could find
Where it lay hidden and it proved kind

THE downs will lose the sun , white alyssum
Lose the bees ' hum

But head and bottle tilted back in the cart
Will never part

Till I am cold as midnight and all my hours
Are beeless flowers

He neither sees , nor hears , nor smells , nor thinks
But only drinks

Quiet in the yard where tree trunks do not lie
More quietly

EARLY one morning in May I set out
And nobody I knew was about

I 'm bound away for ever
Away somewhere , away for ever

There was no wind to trouble the weathercocks
I had burnt my letters and darned my socks

No one knew I was going away
I thought myself I should come back some day

I heard the brook through the town gardens run
O sweet was the mud turned to dust by the sun

A gate banged in a fence and banged in my head
`` A fine morning , sir . '' a shepherd said

I could not return from my liberty
To my youth and my love and my misery

The past is the only dead thing that smells sweet
The only sweet thing that is not also fleet

I 'm bound away for ever
Away somewhere , away for ever

IT rains , and nothing stirs within the fence
Anywhere through the orchard 's untrodden , dense

Of rain on the grassblades there is none to break
Or the fallen petals further down to shake

And I am nearly as happy as possible
To search the wilderness in vain though well

Drenched , yet forgetting the kisses of the rain
Sad , too , to think that never , never again

Unless alone , so happy shall I walk
In the rain . When I turn away , on its fine stalk

Figures , suspended still and ghostly white
The past hovering as it revisits the light

HE has a hump like an ape on his back
He has of money a plentiful lack

And but for a gay coat of double his girth
There is not a plainer thing on the earth

But the huxter has a bottle of beer
He drives a cart and his wife sits near

Who does not heed his lack or his hump
And they laugh as down the lane they bump

`` HE has robbed two clubs . The judge at Salisbury
Ca n't give him more than he undoubtedly

Deserves . The scoundrel ! Look at his photograph
A lady-killer ! Hanging 's too good by half

For such as he . '' So said the stranger , one
With crimes yet undiscovered or undone

But at the inn the Gipsy dame began
`` Now he was what I call a gentleman

He went along with Carrie , and when she
Had a baby he paid up so readily

His half a crown . Just like him . A crown 'd have been
More like him . For I never knew him mean

Oh ! but he was such a nice gentleman . Oh
Last time we met he said if me and Joe

Was anywhere near we must be sure and call
He put his arms around our Amos all

As if he were his own son . I pray God
Save him from justice ! Nicer man never trod

AT hawthorn-time in Wiltshire travelling
In search of something chance would never bring

An old man 's face , by life and weather cut
And coloured , -- rough , brown , sweet as any nut

A land face , sea-blue-eyed , -- hung in my mind
When I had left him many a mile behind

All he said was : `` Nobody ca n't stop 'ee . It 's
A footpath , right enough . You see those bits

Of mounds -- that 's where they opened up the barrows
Sixty years since , while I was scaring sparrows

They thought as there was something to find there
But could n't find it , by digging , anywhere

To turn back then and seek him , where was the use
There were three Manningfords , -- Abbots , Bohun , and Bruce

And whether Alton , not Manningford , it was
My memory could not decide , because

There was both Alton Barnes and Alton Priors
All had their churches , graveyards , farms , and byres

Lurking to one side up the paths and lanes
Seldom well seen except by aeroplanes

And when bells rang , or pigs squealed , or cocks crowed
Then only heard . Ages ago the road

Approached . The people stood and looked and turned
Nor asked it to come nearer , nor yet learned

To move out there and dwell in all men 's dust
And yet withal they shot the weathercock , just

Because 't was he crowed out of tune , they said
So now the copper weathercock is dead

If they had reaped their dandelions and sold
Them fairly , they could have afforded gold

Many years passed , and I went back again
Among those villages , and looked for men

Who might have known my ancient . He himself
Had long been dead or laid upon the shelf

I thought . One man I asked about him roared
At my description : `` 'T is old Bottlesford

He means , Bill . '' But another said : `` Of course
It was Jack Button up at the White Horse

He 's dead , sir , these three years . '' This lasted till
A girl proposed Walker of Walker 's Hill

`` Old Adam Walker . Adam 's Point you 'll see
Marked on the maps . '' `` That was her roguery

The next man said . He was a squire 's son
Who loved wild bird and beast , and dog and gun

For killing them . He had loved them from his birth
One with another , as he loved the earth

`` The man may be like Button , or Walker , or
Like Bottlesford , that you want , but far more

He sounds like one I saw when I was a child
I could almost swear to him . The man was wild

And wandered . His home was where he was free
Everybody has met one such man as he

Does he keep clear old paths that no one uses
But once a life-time when he loves or muses

He is English as this gate , these flowers , this mire
And when at eight years old Lob-lie-by-the-fire

Came in my books , this was the man I saw
He has been in England as long as dove and daw

Calling the wild cherry tree the merry tree
The rose campion Bridget-in-her-bravery

And in a tender mood he , as I guess
Christened one flower Love-in-idleness

And while he walked from Exeter to Leeds
One April called all cuckoo-flowers Milkmaids

From him old herbal Gerard learnt , as a boy
To name wild clematis the Traveller's-joy

Our blackbirds sang no English till his ear
Told him they called his Jan Toy 'Pretty dear

( She was Jan Toy the Lucky , who , having lost
A shilling , and found a penny loaf , rejoiced

For reasons of his own to him the wren
Is Jenny Pooter . Before all other men

'T was he first called the Hog 's Back the Hog 's Back
That Mother Dunch 's Buttocks should not lack

Their name was his care . He too could explain
Totteridge and Totterdown and Juggler 's Lane

He knows , if anyone . Why Tumbling Bay
Inland in Kent , is called so , he might say

`` But little he says compared with what he does
If ever a sage troubles him he will buzz

Like a beehive to conclude the tedious fray
And the sage , who knows all languages , runs away

Yet Lob has thirteen hundred names for a fool
And though he never could spare time for school

To unteach what the fox so well expressed
On biting the cock 's head off , -- Quietness is best

He can talk quite as well as anyone
After his thinking is forgot and done

He first of all told someone else 's wife
For a farthing she 'd skin a flint and spoil a knife

Worth sixpence skinning it . She heard him speak
'She had a face as long as a wet week

Said he , telling the tale in after years
With blue smock and with gold rings in his ears

Sometimes he is a pedlar , not too poor
To keep his wit . This is tall Tom that bore

The logs in , and with Shakespeare in the hall
Once talked , when icicles hung by the wall

As Herne the Hunter he has known hard times
On sleepless nights he made up weather rhymes

Which others spoilt . And , Hob being then his name
He kept the hog that thought the butcher came

To bring his breakfast 'You thought wrong , ' said Hob
When there were kings in Kent this very Lob

Whose sheep grew fat and he himself grew merry
Wedded the king 's daughter of Canterbury

For he alone , unlike squire , lord , and king
Watched a night by her without slumbering

He kept both waking . When he was but a lad
He won a rich man 's heiress , deaf , dumb , and sad

By rousing her to laugh at him . He carried
His donkey on his back . So they were married

And while he was a little cobbler 's boy
He tricked the giant coming to destroy

Shrewsbury by flood . 'And how far is it yet
The giant asked in passing . ' I forget

But see these shoes I 've worn out on the road
And we 're not there yet . ' He emptied out his load

Of shoes for mending . The giant let fall from his spade
The earth for damming Severn , and thus made

The Wrekin hill ; and little Ercall hill
Rose where the giant scraped his boots . While still

So young , our Jack was chief of Gotham 's sages
But long before he could have been wise , ages

Earlier than this , while he grew thick and strong
And ate his bacon , or , at times , sang a song

And merely smelt it , as Jack the giant-killer
He made a name . He too ground up the miller

The Yorkshireman who ground men 's bones for flour
`` Do you believe Jack dead before his hour

Or that his name is Walker , or Bottlesford
Or Button , a mere clown , or squire , or lord

The man you saw , -- Lob-lie-by-the-fire , Jack Cade
Jack Smith , Jack Moon , poor Jack of every trade

Young Jack , or old Jack , or Jack What- d 'ye -call
Jack-in-the-hedge , or Robin-run-by-the-wall

Robin Hood , Ragged Robin , lazy Bob
One of the lords of No Man 's Land , good Lob

Although he was seen dying at Waterloo
Hastings , Agincourt , and Sedgemoor too

Lives yet . He never will admit he is dead
Till millers cease to grind men 's bones for bread

Not till our weathercock crows once again
And I remove my house out of the lane

On to the road . '' With this he disappeared
In hazel and thorn tangled with old-man's-beard

But one glimpse of his back , as there he stood
Choosing his way , proved him of old Jack 's blood

Young Jack perhaps , and now a Wiltshireman
As he has oft been since his days began

THE clouds that are so light
Beautiful , swift and bright

Cast shadows on field and park
Of the earth that is so dark

And even so now , light one
Beautiful , swift and bright one

You let fall on a heart that was dark
Unillumined , a deeper mark

But clouds would have , without earth
To shadow , far less worth

Away from your shadow on me
Your beauty less would be

And if it still be treasured
An age hence , it shall be measured

By this small dark spot
Without which it were not

THERE never was a finer day
And never will be while May is May

The third , and not the last of its kind
But though fair and clear the two behind

Seemed pursued by tempests overpast
And the morrow with fear that it could not last

Was spoiled . To-day ere the stones were warm
Five minutes of thunderstorm

Dashed it with rain , as if to secure
By one tear , its beauty the luck to endure

At mid-day then along the lane
Old Jack Noman appeared again

Jaunty and old , crooked and tall
And stopped and grinned at me over the wall

With a cowslip bunch in his button-hole
And one in his cap . Who could say if his roll

Came from flints in the road , the weather , or ale
He was welcome as the nightingale

Not an hour of the sun had been wasted on Jack
`` I 've got my Indian complexion back

Said he . He was tanned like a harvester
Like his short clay pipe , like the leaf and bur

That clung to his coat from last night 's bed
Like the ploughland crumbling red

Fairer flowers were none on the earth
Than his cowslips wet with the dew of their birth

Or fresher leaves than the cress in his basket
`` Where did they come from , Jack ? '' `` Do n't ask it

And you 'll be told no lies . '' `` Very well
Then I ca n't buy . '' `` I do n't want to sell

Take them and these flowers , too , free
Perhaps you have something to give me

Wait till next time . The better the day
The Lord could n't make a better , I say

If he could , he never has done
So off went Jack with his roll-walk-run

Leaving his cresses from Oakshott rill
And his cowslips from Wheatham hill

'T was the first day that the midges bit
But though they bit me , I was glad of it

Of the dust in my face , too , I was glad
Spring could do nothing to make me sad

Bluebells hid all the ruts in the copse
The elm seeds lay in the road like hops

That fine day , May the twenty-third
The day Jack Noman disappeared

THE rain and wind , the rain and wind , raved endlessly
On me the Summer storm , and fever , and melancholy

Wrought magic , so that if I feared the solitude
Far more I feared all company : too sharp , too rude

Had been the wisest or the dearest human voice
What I desired I knew not , but whate'er my choice

Vain it must be , I knew . Yet naught did my despair
But sweeten the strange sweetness , while through the wild air

All day long I heard a distant cuckoo calling
And , soft as dulcimers , sounds of near water falling

And , softer , and remote as if in history
Rumours of what had touched my friends , my foes , or me

The steam hissed . Someone cleared his throat
No one left and no one came

On the bare platform . What I saw
Was Adlestrop -- only the name

And willows , willow-herb , and grass
And meadowsweet , and haycocks dry

No whit less still and lonely fair
Than the high cloudlets in the sky

And for that minute a blackbird sang
Close by , and round him , mistier

Farther and farther , all the birds
Of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire

This July eve , and question , wondering
What of the lattermath to this hoar Spring

AFTER night 's thunder far away had rolled
The fiery day had a kernel sweet of cold

And in the perfect blue the clouds uncurled
Like the first gods before they made the world

And misery , swimming the stormless sea
In beauty and in divine gaiety

The smooth white empty road was lightly strewn
With leaves -- the holly 's Autumn falls in June

And fir cones standing stiff up in the heat
The mill-foot water tumbled white and lit

With tossing crystals , happier than any crowd
Of children pouring out of school aloud

And in the little thickets where a sleeper
For ever might lie lost , the nettle-creeper

And garden warbler sang unceasingly
While over them shrill shrieked in his fierce glee

The swift with wings and tail as sharp and narrow
As if the bow had flown off with the arrow

Only the scent of woodbine and hay new-mown
Travelled the road . In the field sloping down

Park-like , to where its willows showed the brook
Haymakers rested . The tosser lay forsook

Out in the sun ; and the long waggon stood
Without its team , it seemed it never would

Move from the shadow of that single yew
The team , as still , until their task was due

Beside the labourers enjoyed the shade
That three squat oaks mid-field together made

Upon a circle of grass and weed uncut
And on the hollow , once a chalk-pit , but

Now brimmed with nut and elder-flower so clean
The men leaned on their rakes , about to begin

But still . And all were silent . All was old
This morning time , with a great age untold

Older than Clare and Cobbett , Morland and Crome
Than , at the field 's far edge , the farmer 's home

A white house crouched at the foot of a great tree
Under the heavens that know not what years be

The men , the beasts , the trees , the implements
Uttered even what they will in times far hence

All of us gone out of the reach of change
Immortal in a picture of an old grange

Another day
Until next May

Suddenly
And I only see

NOVEMBER 'S days are thirty
November 's earth is dirty

Those thirty days , from first to last
And the prettiest things on ground are the paths

With morning and evening hobnails dinted
With foot and wing-tip overprinted

Or separately charactered
Of little beast and little bird

The fields are mashed by sheep , the roads
Make the worst going , the best the woods

Where dead leaves upward and downward scatter
Few care for the mixture of earth and water

Twig , leaf , flint , thorn
Straw , feather , all that men scorn

Pounded up and sodden by flood
Condemned as mud

But of all the months when earth is greener
Not one has clean skies that are cleaner

Clean and clear and sweet and cold
They shine above the earth so old

While the after-tempest cloud
Sails over in silence though winds are loud

Till the full moon in the east
Looks at the planet in the west

And earth is silent as it is black
Yet not unhappy for its lack

Up from the dirty earth men stare
One imagines a refuge there

Above the mud , in the pure bright
Of the cloudless heavenly light

Another loves earth and November more dearly
Because without them , he sees clearly

The sky would be nothing more to his eye
Than he , in any case , is to the sky

He loves even the mud whose dyes
Renounce all brightness to the skies

I HAVE come to the borders of sleep
The unfathomable deep

Their way , however straight
Or winding , soon or late

Many a road and track
That , since the dawn 's first crack

Deceived the travellers
Suddenly now blurs

Here love ends
Despair , ambition ends

Although most sweet or bitter
Here ends in sleep that is sweeter

There is not any book
Or face of dearest look

To go into the unknown
I must enter and leave alone

The tall forest towers
Its cloudy foliage lowers

Its silence I hear and obey
That I may lose my way

Ah ! then , how dear the Muse 's favours cost
If those paint sorrow best -- who feel it most

Another May new buds and flowers shall bring
Ah ! why has happiness -- no second spring

Tell'st to the Moon thy tale of tender woe
From what sad cause can such sweet sorrow flow

What mean the sounds that swell thy little breast
When still at dewy eve thou leav'st thy nest

Ah ! songstress sad ! that such my lot might be
To sigh and sing at Liberty -- like thee

Oh ! that I soon may reach thy world serene
Poor wearied pilgrim -- in this toiling scene

Ah ! no ! -- when all , e'en Hope 's last ray is gone
There 's no oblivion -- but in death alone

Come then , 'pale Misery 's love ! ' be thou my cure
And I will bless thee , who though slow art sure

'Twere surely met in thee ! -- thy prospect fair
Thy sounds of harmony , thy balmy air

Pours out some tale antique of rural love
Ah ! he has never felt the pangs that move

Th ' indignant spirit , when with selfish pride
Friends , on whose faith the trusting heart relied

Yet of that tender heart , ah ! still retain
A share for me -- and I will not complain

But still thy opiate aid dost thou deny
To calm the anxious breast ; to close the streaming eye

Where on the fractured cliff the billows break
Musing , my solitary seat I take

The screaming sea-bird quits the troubled sea
But the wild gloomy scene has charms for me

Like the poor mariner methinks I stand
Cast on a rock ; who sees the distant land

Faint and more faint are heard his feeble cries
Till in the rising tide the exhausted sufferer dies

Whate'er my destiny may be
That faithful heart still burns for thee

Forming bright waves with amorous Zephyr 's sighs
And though averted now , her charming eyes

That fine suffusion on thy cheek was love
What wonder then those beauteous tints should move

Were of a goddess -- not a mortal maid
Yet though thy charms , thy heavenly charms should fade

Nor cure for me in time or change be found
The shaft extracted does not cure the wound

Ah ! yield not thus to culpable despair
But raise thine eyes to Heaven -- and think I wait thee there

To Heaven she 's fled ! and nought to me remains
But the pale ashes which her urn contains

And in thy boughs the murmuring Ring-dove rest
And there the Nightingale shall build her nest

Unworthy oft may titled fortune be
A soul like thine -- is true Nobility

And those immortal leaves his temples shade
Whose fair , eternal verdure -- shall not fade

And future Nevills through long ages shine
With hearts as good , and forms as fair as thine

So round the flame the giddy insect flies
And courts the fatal fire by which it dies

Ah , Nymph ! that fate assist me to endure
And bear awhile -- what death alone can cure

So o'er my soul short rays of reason fly
Then fade : -- and leave me to despair and die

Yes -- Charlotte o'er the mournful spot shall weep
Where her poor Werter -- and his sorrows sleep

Yet may thy pity mingle not with pain
For then thy hapless lover -- dies in vain

While kindred spirits , pitying , shall relate
Thy Otway 's sorrows , and lament his fate

Ah ! -- for their future fate how many fears
Oppress my heart -- and fill mine eyes with tears

Thy classic stream anew shall hear a lay
Bright as its waves , and various as its way

Feed the green ear , and nurse the future sheaves
-- Ah , blest the hind -- whom no sad thought bereaves

Ah , what to me can those dear days restore
When scenes could charm that now I taste no more

And the grey mists from these dim waves arise
I love to listen to the hollow sighs

Oft seems to fleet before the poet 's eyes
Strange sounds are heard , and mournful melodies

And who , to all that genius can impart
Adds the cool head , and the unblemish 'd heart

( All inauspicious as my fate appears
By troubles darken 'd , that increase with years

A spirit free from all intrusive fears
Nor will they deign to wipe away the tears

And when at length it heaves its latest sigh
Thou and mild Hope shall teach me how to die

And points my wishes to that tranquil shore
Where the pale spectre Care pursues no more

Forth to fictitious happiness it flies
And where Elysian bowers of bliss arise

Alas ! these joys are mine in dreams alone
When cruel Reason abdicates her throne

And as the dear delusions leave my brain
She bids the truth recur -- with aggravated pain

Will to the deaf cold elements complain
And tell the embosom 'd grief , however vain

I still enjoy thee -- cheerless as thou art
For in thy quiet gloom the exhausted heart

While to the winds and waves its sorrows given
May reach -- though lost on earth -- the ear of Heaven

Or bid a bosom transient quiet prove
That bleeds with vain remorse and unextinguish 'd love

How seldom art thou found -- Tranquillity
Unless 't is when with mild and downcast eye

The shrieking night-jar sail on heavy wing
Ah ! yet a little -- and propitious spring

Bid Syren Hope resume her long-lost part
And chase the vulture Care -- that feeds upon the heart

To the bleak coast of some unfriendly isle
Cold , barren , desert , where no harvests smile

The fancied semblance of a distant sail
Then melts away -- anew his spirits fail

Ah ! so for me delusive fancy toils
Then , from contrasted truth -- my feeble soul recoils

While the loud equinox its power combines
The sea no more its swelling surge confines

Drives the huge billows from their heaving bed
Tears from their grassy tombs the village dead

Lo ! their bones whiten in the frequent wave
But vain to them the winds and waters rave

While I am doom 'd -- by life 's long storm opprest
To gaze with envy on their gloomy rest

My early vows were paid to Nature 's shrine
When thoughtless joy , and infant hope were mine

But where now clamours the discordant hern
The spoiling hand of Time may overturn

But fame and beauty still defy decay
Saved by the historic page -- the poet 's tender lay

The mournful path approaching to the tomb
While Faith 's consoling voice endears the friendly gloom

And mine thy calm and enviable rest
For never more by human ills opprest

Shall thy soft spirit fruitlessly repine
Thou canst not now thy fondest hopes resign

Even in the hour that should have made thee blest
Light lies the turf upon thy virgin breast

While still for him shall faithful Memory save
Thy form and virtues from the silent grave

My happy childhood past among your bowers
Ye wood-walks wild ! -- where leaves and fairy flowers

Though lost to me -- still may thy smile serene
Bless the dear lord of this regretted scene

Feeds but the summer-shepherd 's little flock
With scanty herbage from the half-clothed rock

I could with thee for months and years be blest
And of thy tenderness and love possest

For thou to me canst sovereign bliss impart
Thy mind my empire -- and my throne thy heart

O'er the blank void he looks with hopeless pain
For him those beams of heaven shall never shine again

His careless head on bark and moss reclined
Lull 'd by the song of birds , the murmuring wind

Till the last sleep these weary eyes shall close
And Death receive me to his long repose

But now ! -- such evils in my lot combine
As shut my languid sense -- to Hope 's dear voice and thine

His lucid treasure , rayless as the dust
-- So turn the world 's bright joys to cold and blank disgust

The low horizon gathering vapours shroud
Sudden , from many a deep-embattled cloud

Terrific thunders burst and lightnings fly
While in serenest azure , beaming high

I woo thee with unusual prayer
`` Grim visaged , comfortless Despair

Approach ; in me a willing victim find
Who seeks thine iron sway -- and calls thee kind

While in dire contrast , to mine eyes
Thy phantoms , yet more hideous , rise

And Memory draws from Pleasure 's wither 'd flower
Corrosives for the heart -- of fatal power

The wounds he gave , nor Time shall cure
Nor Reason teach me to endure

And to that breast mild Patience pleads in vain
Which feels the curse -- of meriting its pain

But of illusion long the sport
That dreary , tranquil gloom I court

Where my past errors I may still deplore
And dream of long-lost happiness no more

But callous , in thy deep repose
Behold , in long array , the woes

Of the dread future , calm and undismayed
Till I may claim the hope -- that shall not fade

WHEN Jove , in anger to the sons of the earth
Bid artful Vulcan give Pandora birth

And sent the fatal gift which spread below
O'er all the wretched race contagious woe

Unhappy man , by vice and folly tost
Found in the storms of life his quiet lost

While Envy , Avarice , and Ambition , hurled
Discord and death around the warring world

Then the blest peasant left his fields and fold
And barter 'd love and peace for power and gold

Left his calm cottage and his native plain
In search of wealth to tempt the faithless main

Or , braving danger , in the battle stood
And bathed his savage hands in human blood

No longer then , his woodland walks among
The shepherd lad his genuine passion sung

Or sought at early morn his soul 's delight
Or graved her name upon the bark at night

To deck her flowing hair no more he wove
The simple wreath , or with ambitious love

Bound his own brow with myrtle or with bay
But broke his pipe , or threw his crook away

The nymphs forsaken , other pleasures sought
Then first for gold their venal hearts were bought

And nature 's blush to sickly art gave place
And affectation seized the seat of grace

No more simplicity by sense refined
Or generous sentiment , possess 'd the mind

No more they felt each other 's joy and woe
And Cupid fled , and hid his useless bow

But with deep grief propitious Venus pined
To see the ills which threaten 'd womankind

Ills that she knew her empire would disarm
And rob her subjects of their sweetest charm

Good humour 's potent influence destroy
And change for lowering frowns the smile of joy

Then deeply sighing at the mournful view
She tried at length what heavenly art could do

To bring back Pleasure to her pensive train
And vindicate the glories of her reign

A thousand little loves attend the task
And bear from Mars 's head his radiant casque

The fair enchantress on its silver bound
Weaved with soft spells her magic cestus round

Then shaking from her hair ambrosial dew
Infused fair hope , and expectation new

And stifled wishes , and persuasive sighs
And fond belief , and 'eloquence of eyes

And falt'ring accents , which explain so well
What studied speeches vainly try to tell

And more pathetic silence , which imparts
Infectious tenderness to feeling hearts

Soft tones of pity ; fascinating smiles
And Maia 's son assisted her with wiles

And brought gay dreams , fantastic visions brought
And waved his wand o'er the seducing draught

Then Zephyr came : to him the goddess cried
`` Go fetch from Flora all her flowery pride

To fill my charm , each scented bud that blows
And bind my myrtles with her thornless rose

Then speed thy flight to Gallia 's smiling plain
Where rolls the Loire , the Garonne , and the Seine

Dip in their waters thy celestial wing
And the soft dew to fill my chalice bring

But chiefly tell thy Flora , that to me
She send a bouquet of her fleurs de lys

That poignant spirit will complete my spell
-- 'T is done : the lovely sorceress says 't is well

And now Apollo lends a ray of fire
The caldron bubbles , and the flames aspire

The watchful Graces round the circle dance
With arms entwined to mark the work 's advance

And with full quiver sportive Cupid came
Temp'ring his favourite arrows in the flame

Then Venus speaks , the wavering flames retire
And Zephyr 's breath extinguishes the fire

At length the goddess in the helmet 's round
A sweet and subtile spirit duly found

More soft than oil , than ether more refined
Of power to cure the woes of womankind

And call 'd it Flattery : -- balm of female life
It charms alike the widow , maid , and wife

Clears the sad brow of virgins in despair
And smooths the cruel traces left by care

Bids palsied age with youthful spirit glow
And hangs May 's garlands on December 's snow

Delicious essence ! howsoe'er applied
By what rude nature is thy charm denied

Some form seducing still thy whisper wears
Stern Wisdom turns to thee her willing ears

The rustic nymph whom rigid aunts restrain
Condemn 'd to dress , and practise airs in vain

At thy first summons finds her bosom swell
And bids her crabbed gouvernantes farewell

While , fired by thee with spirit not her own
She grows a toast , and rises into ton

The faded beauty who , with secret pain
Sees younger charms usurp her envied reign

By thee assisted , can with smiles behold
The record where her conquests are enrolled

And dwelling yet on scenes by memory nursed
When George the Second reign 'd , or George the First

She sees the shades of ancient beaux arise
Who swear her eyes exceeded modern eyes

When poets sung for her , and lovers bled
And giddy fashion follow 'd as she led

Departed modes appear in long array
The flowers and flounces of her happier day

Again her locks the decent fillets bind
The waving lappet flutters in the wind

And then comparing with a proud disdain
The more fantastic tastes that now obtain

She deems ungraceful , trifling and absurd
The gayer world that moves round George the Third

Nor thy soft influence will the train refuse
Who court in distant shades the modest Muse

Though in a form more pure and more refined
Thy soothing spirit meets the letter 'd mind

Not death itself thine empire can destroy
Tow'rds thee , even then , we turn the languid eye

Still trust in thee to bid our memory bloom
And scatter roses round the silent tomb

WHERE cliffs arise by winter crowned
And through dark groves of pine around

Within some hollow , shelter 'd from the storms
The Peasant of the Alps his cottage forms

Unenvied is the rich domain
That far beneath him on the plain

More dear to him his hut with plantain thatched
Where long his unambitious heart attached

There dwells the mistress of his heart
And Love , who teaches every art

When borrowing from the vale its fertile soil
He climbs the precipice with patient toil

With native shrubs , a hardy race
There the green myrtle finds a place

While from the crags abrupt , and tangled steeps
With bloom and fruit the Alpine berry peeps

His garden 's simple produce stored
Prepared for him by hands adored

And by the same dear hands are softly spread
The Chamois ' velvet spoil that forms the bed

But absent from the calm abode
Dark thunder gathers round his road

Returning quick the murmuring rocks among
His faint heart trembling as he winds along

Of rifted ice ! -- Oh , man of woe
O'er his dear cot -- a mass of snow

Has fallen -- and buried in its marble breast
All that for him -- lost wretch -- the world possest

Aghast the heart-struck mourner stands
Glazed are his eyes -- convulsed his hands

Crush 'd by despair 's intolerable weight
Frantic he seeks the mountain 's giddiest height

A fate too similar is mine
But I -- in lingering pain repine

Cold , cold to me is that dear breast become
Where this poor heart had fondly fix 'd its home

IN early youth 's unclouded scene
The brilliant morning of eighteen

We gazed on life 's enchanting spring
Nor thought how quickly time would bring

Then the starch maid , or matron sage
Already at the sober age

In whose sharp words , or sharper face
With thoughtless mirth we loved to trace

Till saddening , sickening at the view
We learn 'd to dread what Time might do

To end our days ere that arrived
When ( power and pleasure long survived

But time , in spite of wishes , flies
And Fate our simple prayer denies

The auburn locks are mix 'd with grey
The transient roses fade away

Her voice the anguish contradicts
That dying vanity inflicts

For us she opens to the view
Prospects less bright -- but far more true

No more shall scandal 's breath destroy
The social converse we enjoy

O'er youth 's bright blooms her blights shall pour
But spare the improving friendly hour

Stripp 'd of their gaudy hues by Truth
We view the glitt'ring toys of youth

For which to public scenes we ran
And scorn 'd of sober sense the plan

Though Time 's inexorable sway
Has torn the myrtle bands away

The amaranth 's purple glow survives
And still Minerva 's olive lives

With eye more steady we engage
To contemplate approaching age

With firmer souls , and stronger powers
With reason , faith , and friendship ours

O'ERWHELM 'D with sorrow , and sustaining long
`` The proud man 's contumely , th ' oppressor 's wrong

Languid despondency , and vain regret
Must my exhausted spirit struggle yet

Yes ! -- Robb 'd myself of all that fortune gave
Even of all hope -- but shelter in the grave

Still shall the plaintive lyre essay its powers
To dress the cave of Care with Fancy 's flowers

Maternal Love the fiend Despair withstand
Still animate the heart and guide the hand

-- May you , dear objects of my anxious care
Escape the evils I was born to bear

Round my devoted head while tempests roll
Yet there , where I have treasured up my soul

May the soft rays of dawning hope impart
Reviving patience to my fainting heart

And when its sharp solicitudes shall cease
May I be conscious in the realms of peace

That every tear which swells my children 's eyes
From sorrows past , not present ills arise

Then , with some friend who loves to share your pain
For 't is my boast that some such friends remain

By filial grief , and fond remembrance prest
You 'll seek the spot where all my sorrows rest

Recall my hapless days in sad review
The long calamities I bore for you

And , with a happier fate , resolve to prove
How well you merited your mother 's love

With such unconscious beauty , pensive , mild
Miranda charms -- Nature 's soft modest child

Ah ! Reason little o'er the soul prevails
When , from ideal ill , the enfeebled spirit fails

Ends but in sad vicissitudes of care
I only fly from doubt -- to meet despair

Which , fragile as the fleeting dreams of morn
Leave but the wither 'd heath , and barren thorn

Where Hope 's soft visions have no longer part
And whose sad inmate -- is a broken heart

Adversity 's cold blight , and bitter storms
Luxuriant Summer 's evanescent forms

Shrink from the bleakness of the Northern blast
So fail from present care and sorrow past

That dares the Lapse of Time , and Tempest rude
The unfading Amaranth of Gratitude

Alone I wander -- Calm untroubled rest
`` Nature 's soft nurse , '' deserts the high-swoln breast

Nor is the deepest shade , the keenest air
Black as my fate , or cold as my despair

And veil 'd in shadows Nature 's face appears
To hearts o'erwhelm 'd with grief , to eyes suffused with tears

Threw a bright veil , and catching lights between
Fell on the glancing sail , that we had seen

His cottage thatch amid surrounding trees
Yet , trembling , dreads lest sorrow or disease

But all he loves are safe ; with heart elate
Though poor and plunder 'd , he absolves his fate

He seems ( uncursed with reason ) not to know
The depth or the duration of his woe

From sights and sounds of gaiety -- I mourn
All that gave me delight -- Ah ! never to return

The seaman greets , as on the ocean stream
Reflected , thy precursive friendly beam

Quench 'd in the gloom of death that heavenly ray
Once lent to light me on my thorny way

Think , ere thy irritable nerves repine
How many , born with feelings keen as thine

Think ; nor impatient at a feather 's weight
Mar the uncommon blessings of thy fate

Forsakes me , while the chill and sullen blast
As my sad soul recalls its sorrows past

By her , whose loss in anguish I deplore
I shall be laid , and feel that loss no more

Seems beckoning him with smiles to join the train
Then , starting from his dream , he feels his woes again

Of petty despots in their pedant reign
Already hast thou felt ; -- and high disdain

For the best virtues live ; or that denied
May'st die , as Hampden or as Sydney died

Of Gossamer suspended , in mid air
Float'st on a sun beam -- Living atom , where

Of rainbow-light around his head revolve
Ah ! soon at Sorrow 's touch the radiant dreams dissolve

The Seasons go ; while I through all repine
For fix 'd regret , and hopeless grief are mine

Of Violence and Fraud , allow 'd to take
All peace from humble life ; I would forsake

Your `` bells and florrets of unnumber 'd dyes
Might rest -- And learn the bright varieties

While thy fair beams illume another sky
And shine for beings less accursed than I

Where briony and woodbine fringe the trees
On thymy banks reposing , while the bees

Knows , in refined retirement , to possess
By friendship hallow 'd -- rural happiness

Wert thou by thy low fortune : but a time
Like this we live in , when the abject chime

By all the ills o'er which thine heart has bled
Associate , worthy of the illustrious dead

Or from his course celestial , sinking slow
The summer-sun in purple radiance low

Move the war-freighted ships ; and fierce and red
Flash their destructive fires -- The mangled dead

And dying victims then pollute the flood
Ah , thus man spoils Heaven 's glorious works with blood

Lent warmer lustre to the radiant morn
And even o'er summer scenes by tempests torn

Shed with illusive light the dewy ray
Of pensive pleasure ? Wilt thou , while the day

From my faint eyes thy graceful form recedes
Thou canst not heal a heart like mine that bleeds

Haply mayst thou one sorrowing vigil keep
Where Pity and Remembrance bend and weep

WHEN in a thousand swarms , the summer o'er
The birds of passage quit our English shore

By various routs the feather 'd myriad moves
The Becca-Fica seeks Italian groves

No more a Wheat-ear ; while the soaring files
Of sea-fowl gather round the Hebrid isles

But if by bird-lime touch 'd , unplumed , confined
Some poor ill-fated straggler stays behind

Driven from his transient perch , beneath your eaves
On his unshelter 'd head the tempest raves

While drooping round , redoubling every pain
His mate and nestlings ask his help in vain

So we , the buskin and the sock who wear
And `` strut and fret , '' our little season here

Dismiss 'd at length , as fortune bids divide
Some ( lucky rogues ! ) sit down on Thames 's side

Others to Liffy 's western banks proceed
And some -- driven far a-field , across the Tweed

But , pinion 'd here , alas ! I can not fly
The hapless , unplumed , lingering straggler I

Unless the healing pity you bestow
Shall imp my shatter 'd wings , and let me go

Hard is his fate , whom evil stars have led
To seek in scenic art precarious bread

While still , through wild vicissitudes afloat
A hero now , and now a Sans Culotte

That eleemosynary bread he gains
Mingling , with real distresses , mimic pains

See in our group , a pale , lank Falstaff stare
Much needs he stuffing : -- while young Ammon there

And as his soft Statira sighs consent
Roxana comes not -- but a dun for rent

Here shiv'ring Edgar , in his blanket rolled
Exclaims -- with too much reason , `` Tom 's a-cold

And vainly tries his sorrows to divert
While Goneril or Regan -- wash his shirt

Lo ! fresh from Calais , Edward , mighty king
Revolves -- a mutton chop upon a string

And Hotspur , plucking `` honour from the moon
Feeds a sick infant with a pewter spoon

More bless 'd the fisher , who undaunted braves
In his small bark , the impetuous winds and waves

For though he plough the sea when others sleep
He draws , like Glendower , spirits from the deep

And while the storm howls round , amidst his trouble
Bright moonshine still illuminates the cobble

Pale with her fears for him , some fair Poissarde
Watches his nearing boat ; with fond regard

Smiles when she sees his little canvass handing
And clasps her dripping lover on his landing

More bless 'd the peasant , who , with nervous toil
Hews the rough oak , or breaks the stubborn soil

Weary , indeed , he sees the evening come
But then , the rude , yet tranquil hut , his home

Receives its rustic inmate ; then are his
Secure repose , and dear domestic bliss

The orchard 's blushing fruit , the garden 's store
The pendant hop , that mantles round the door

Are his : -- and while cheerful faggots burn
`` His lisping children hail their site 's return

But wandering Players , `` unhousel 'd , unannealed
And unappointed , scour life 's common field

A flying squadron ! -- disappointments cross 'em
And the campaign concludes , perhaps , at Horsham

Oh ! ye , whose timely bounty deigns to shed
Compassion 's balm upon my luckless head

Benevolence , with warm and glowing breast
And soft , celestial mercy , doubly blessed

Smile on the generous act ! -- where means are given
To aid the wretched -- is to merit heaven

WHATE'ER of praise , and of regret attend
The grateful servant , and the humble friend

Where strict integrity and worth unite
To raise the lowly in their Maker 's sight

Are her 's ; whose faithful service , long approved
Wept by the mistress whom through life she loved

Here ends her earthly task ; in joyful trust
To share the eternal triumph of the just

CHAOTIC pile of barren stone
That Nature 's hurrying hand has thrown

On whose rude brow the rifted tower
Has frown 'd , through many a stormy hour

Sure Desolation loves to shroud
His giant form within the cloud

And as through broken vaults beneath
The future storms low-muttering breathe

Here marks the fiend with eager eyes
Far out at sea the fogs arise

And listens the portentous roar
Of sullen waves , as on the shore

Northward the demon 's eyes are cast
O'er yonder bare and sterile waste

Man , lost in ignorance and toil
Becomes associate to the soil

On the bleak hills , with flint o'erspread
No blossoms rear the purple head

But o'er the cold and cheerless down
Grim desolation seems to frown

Here the scathed trees with leaves half-dressed
Shade no soft songster 's secret nest

But high the croaking cormorant flies
And mews and hawks with clamorous cries

Perchance among the ruins grey
Some widow 'd mourner loves to stray

Where once , afar she could discern
O'er the white waves his sail return

On these lone tombs , by storms up-torn
The hopeless wretch may lingering mourn

The misty moon with lurid ray
Lights her , reluctant , on her way

Hence the dire spirit oft surveys
The ship , that to the western bays

Then calls the vapour dark that blinds
The pilot , -- calls the felon winds

Commixing with the blotted skies
High and more high the wild waves rise

Driven on yon fatal bank accursed
The vessel 's massy timbers burst

There find the weak an early grave
While youthful strength the whelming wave

With shorten 'd breath and upturn 'd eyes
Sees the rough shore above him rise

And are there then in human form
Monsters more savage than the storm

The dripping weed ? -- who dare to reap
The inhuman harvest of the deep

Ah , yes ! by avarice once possessed
No pity moves the rustic breast

Till I ( a pilgrim weary worn
To my own native land return

AS in the woods , where leathery Lichen weaves
Its wint'ry web among the sallow leaves

Which ( through cold months in whirling eddies blown
Decay beneath the branches once their own

From the brown shelter of their foliage sear
Spring the young blooms that lead the floral year

When , waked by vernal suns , the Pilewort dares
Expand her spotted leaves , and shining stars

And ( veins empurpling all her tassels pale
Bends the soft Wind-flower in the tepid gale

Uncultured bells of azure Jacynth 's blow
And the breeze-scenting Violet lurks below

So views the wanderer , with delighted eyes
Reviving hopes from black despondence rise

When , blighted by adversity 's chill breath
Those hopes had felt a temporary death

Then with gay heart he looks to future hours
When love shall dress for him the summer bowers

And , as delicious dreams enchant his mind
Forgets his sorrows past , or gives them to the wind

WHERE thy broad branches brave the bitter North
Like rugged , indigent , unheeded , worth

Lo ! Vegetation 's guardian hands emboss
Each giant limb with fronds of studded moss

That clothes the bark in many a fringed fold
Begemm 'd with scarlet shields , and cups of gold

Which , to the wildest winds their webs oppose
And mock the arrowy sleet , or weltering snows

-- But to the warmer West the woodbine fair
With tassels that perfumed the summer air

The mantling clematis , whose feathery bowers
Waved in festoons with nightshade 's purple flowers

The silver weed , whose corded fillets wove
Round thy pale rind , even as deceitful love

Of mercenary beauty would engage
The dotard fondness of decrepit age

All these , that during summer 's halcyon days
With their green canopies conceal 'd thy sprays

Are gone for ever ; or disfigured , trail
Their sallow relicts in the autumnal gale

Or o'er thy roots , in faded fragments tossed
But tell of happier hours , and sweetness lost

-- Thus in Fate 's trying hour , when furious storms
Strip social life of Pleasure 's fragile forms

And awful Justice , as his rightful prey
Tears Luxury 's silk , and jewel 'd robe , away

While reads Adversity her lesson stern
And Fortune 's minions tremble as they learn

The crowds around her gilded car that hung
Bent the lithe knee , and troul 'd the honey 'd tongue

Desponding fall , or fly in pale despair
And Scorn alone remembers that they were

Not so Integrity ; unchanged he lives
In the rude armour conscious Honour gives

And dares with hardy front the troubled sky
In Honesty 's uninjured panoply

Ne'er on Prosperity 's enfeebling bed
Or rosy pillows , he reposed his head

But given to useful arts , his ardent mind
Has sought the general welfare of mankind

To mitigate their ills his greatest bliss
While studying them , has taught him what he is

He , when the human tempest rages worst
And the earth shudders as the thunders burst

Firm , as thy northern branch , is rooted fast
And if he ca n't avert , endures the blast

Of the cottage , where Will of the Woodland was nursed
And lived so beloved , till the moment accursed

Was Will of the Woodlands ; and often the old
Would tell of his frolics , for active and bold

The woodman his father , young William away
Would go to the forest to labour all day

He toil 'd from the dawn , and at evening he hied
In storm or in snow , or whate'er might betide

But she would send Phoebe , the child she loved best
To stay with the widow , thus sad and distressed

Her form , like the aspen , wild graces displayed
And the eyes , over which her luxuriant locks strayed

'T was hard , yet 't was honest ; and one tender smile
From Phoebe at night overpaid ev'ry toil

Then soft from her home his sweet Phoebe would steal
And bring him wood-strawberries to finish his meal

Yet Phoebe going home , through the wood-walk has strayed
To bid him good night ! -- and whatever she said

And touch 'd with illusion , that often deceives
The future with light ; as the sun through the leaves

And now ere the dawn , the young woodman must go
To his work in the forest , half buried in snow

The stream to a wild rapid river was grown
And long might the widow sit sighing alone

Young William went forth ; and his mother with sighs
Watch 'd long at the window , with tears in her eyes

She look 'd from the door ; not a star lent its light
But the tempest redoubled the gloom of the night

'T was midnight : her spirits sank hopeless and cold
And it seem 'd as each blast of wind fearfully told

To guide his dark steps ; but she listen 'd and wept
Or if for a moment forgetful she slept

When the poor wretched mother still drooping , alone
Beheld on the threshold a figure unknown

Nay , be not cast down ; you perhaps may soon see
Your William a captain , he now sends by me

But he seem 'd to begin with ill omens his course
And felt recollection , regret , and remorse

And saw the green hills , on whose northernmost side
Was his own silvan home : and he falter 'd , and cried

Ah ! canst thou forgive me ? And not in the pain
Of this cruel desertion , of William complain

But comfort my mother ; and quiet her fear
And help her to dry up the vain fruitless tear

The thought was too cruel ; and anguish now sped
The dart of disease -- With the brave numerous dead

Where the mother of William , unable to bear
His loss , who to her widow 'd heart was so dear

The poor wandering Phoebe will silently steal
The pain of her bosom no reason can heal

Reed garlands , against her dear William appears
Then breathlessly listens , and fancies she hears

Who from pictured saloon , or the bright sculptured hearth
Disperse desolation and death through the earth

NOT for the promise of the labour 'd field
Not for the good the yellow harvests yield

For dull , to human eyes , appear
The golden glories of the year

Thou brilliant weed
That dost so far exceed

The rose , or thorn , my labours crowned
As Venus smiled , or Venus frowned

Unless , perchance , the attributes of Grief
The cypress bud , and willow leaf

Hail , lovely blossom ! -- thou canst ease
The wretched victims of Disease

Canst close those weary eyes in gentle sleep
Which never open but to weep

For , oh ! thy potent charm
Can agonizing Pain disarm

Expel imperious Memory from her seat
And bid the throbbing heart forget to beat

Soul-soothing plant ! that can such blessings give
By thee the mourner bears to live

Oh ! ever `` friendly to despair
Might Sorrow 's pallid votary dare

No more I 'd sue that thou shouldst spread
Thy spell around my aching head

But would conjure thee to impart
Thy balsam for a broken heart

And by thy soft Lethean power
( Inestimable flower

SWEET age of bless 'd delusion ! blooming boys
Ah ! revel long in childhood 's thoughtless joys

With light and pliant spirits , that can stoop
To follow , sportively , the rolling hoop

To watch the sleeping top with gay delight
Or mark , with raptured gaze , the sailing kite

Or , eagerly pursuing Pleasure 's call
Can find it center 'd in the bounding ball

Alas ! the day will come , when sports like these
Must lose their magic , and their power to please

Too swiftly fled , the rosy hours of youth
Shall yield their fairy charms to mournful Truth

Even now , a mother 's fond prophetic fear
Sees the dark train of human ills appear

Views various fortune for each lovely child
Storms for the bold , and anguish for the mild

Beholds already those expressive eyes
Beam a sad certainty of future sighs

And dreads each suffering those dear breasts may know
In their long passage through a world of woe

Perchance predestined every pang to prove
That treacherous friends inflict , or faithless love

For , ah ! how few have found existence sweet
Where grief is sure , but happiness deceit

He , who compell 'd each poignant grief to know
Drains to its lowest dregs the cup of woe

Him , who too much impoverish 'd to obtain
From British Themis right , implores her aid in vain

Or who to thy asylum not remove
To lose the wasting anguish of ungrateful love

Fear thee , O Death ! -- Or hug the chains that bind
To joyless , cheerless life , her sick , reluctant mind

May well the terrors of thy triumph brave
Nor pause in fearful dread before the opening grave

In youth from rock to rock I went
From hill to hill , in discontent

But now my own delights I make
My thirst at every rill can slake

When soothed a while by milder airs
Thee Winter in the garland wears

Whole summer fields are thine by right
And Autumn , melancholy Wight

In shoals and bands , a morrice train
Thou greet'st the Traveller in the lane

Nor car'st if thou be set at naught
And oft alone in nooks remote

Be Violets in their secret mews
The flowers the wanton Zephyrs chuse

Thou liv'st with less ambitious aim
Yet hast not gone without thy fame

If to a rock from rains he fly
Or , some bright day of April sky

And wearily at length should fare
He need but look about , and there

A hundred times , by rock or bower
Ere thus I have lain couch 'd an hour

Some steady love ; some brief delight
Some memory that had taken flight

If stately passions in me burn
And one chance look to Thee should turn

The homely sympathy that heeds
The common life , our nature breeds

When , smitten by the morning ray
I see thee rise alert and gay

At dusk , I 've seldom mark 'd thee press
The ground , as if in thankfulness

And all day long I number yet
All seasons through , another debt

An instinct call it , a blind sense
A happy , genial influence

Child of the Year ! that round dost run
Thy course , bold lover of the sun

Thou long the Poet 's praise shalt gain
Thou wilt be more belov 'd by men

I met Louisa in the shade
And , having seen that lovely Maid

That she is ruddy , fleet , and strong
And down the rocks can leap along

And she hath smiles to earth unknown
Smiles , that with motion of their own

That come and go with endless play
And ever , as they pass away

She loves her fire , her Cottage-home
Yet o'er the moorland will she roam

And when against the wind she strains
Oh ! might I kiss the mountain rains

Take all that 's mine 'beneath the moon
If I with her but half a noon

Of some old cave , or mossy nook
When up she winds along the brook

And now at distance can discern
A stirring in a brake of fern

From which immediately leaps out
A Dog , and yelping runs about

Nor is there any one in sight
All round , in Hollow or on Height

Nor shout , nor whistle strikes his ear
What is the Creature doing here

Far in the bosom of Helvellyn
Remote from public Road or Dwelling

Pathway , or cultivated land
From trace of human foot or hand

Thither the Rainbow comes , the Cloud
And Mists that spread the flying shroud

And Sun-beams ; and the sounding blast
That , if it could , would hurry past

Nor far had gone before he found
A human skeleton on the ground

Sad sight ! the Shepherd with a sigh
Looks round , to learn the history

He instantly recall 'd the Name
And who he was , and whence he came

Remember 'd , too , the very day
On which the Traveller pass 'd this way

The Dog , which still was hovering nigh
Repeating the same timid cry

This Dog had been through three months ' space
A Dweller in that savage place

How nourish 'd here through such long time
He knows , who gave that love sublime

And gave that strength of feeling , great
Above all human estimate

She was a Phantom of delight
When first she gleam 'd upon my sight

A lovely Apparition , sent
To be a moment 's ornament

Her eyes as stars of Twilight fair
Like Twilight 's , too , her dusky hair

But all things else about her drawn
From May-time and the chearful Dawn

A dancing Shape , an Image gay
To haunt , to startle , and way-lay

I saw her upon nearer view
A Spirit , yet a Woman too

Her household motions light and free
And steps of virgin liberty

A countenance in which did meet
Sweet records , promises as sweet

A Creature not too bright or good
For human nature 's daily food

For transient sorrows , simple wiles
Praise , blame , love , kisses , tears , and smiles

And now I see with eye serene
The very pulse of the machine

A Being breathing thoughtful breath
A Traveller betwixt life and death

The reason firm , the temperate will
Endurance , foresight , strength and skill

A perfect Woman ; nobly planned
To warn , to comfort , and command

And yet a Spirit still , and bright
With something of an angel light

Art thou the Bird whom Man loves best
The pious Bird with the scarlet breast

Their Thomas in Finland
And Russia far inland

The Bird , whom by some name or other
All men who know thee call their Brother

Could Father Adam open his eyes
And see this sight beneath the skies

If the Butterfly knew but his friend
Hither his flight he would bend

And find his way to me
Under the branches of the tree

A beautiful Creature
That is gentle by nature

Beneath the summer sky
From flower to flower let him fly

The Chearer Thou of our in-door sadness
He is the Friend of our summer gladness

Playmates in the sunny weather
And fly about in the air together

Like the hues of thy breast
His beautiful wings in crimson are drest

If thou would'st be happy in thy nest
O pious Bird ! whom Man loves best

Majestic in her person , tall and straight
And like a Roman matron 's was her mien and gait

She begg 'd an alms , like one in poor estate
I look 'd at her again , nor did my pride abate

She answer 'd soon as she the question heard
`` A simple burthen , Sir , a little Singing-bird

And I have been as far as Hull , to see
What clothes he might have left , or other property

When last he sail 'd he left the Bird behind
As it might be , perhaps , from bodings of his mind

And now , God help me for my little wit
I trail it with me , Sir ! he took so much delight in it

Pansies , Lilies , Kingcups , Daisies
Let them live upon their praises

There 's a flower that shall be mine
'T is the little Celandine

Eyes of some men travel far
For the finding of a star

Little flower ! -- I 'll make a stir
Like a great Astronomer

Modest , yet withal an Elf
Bold , and lavish of thyself

Thou hast now , go where I may
Fifty greetings in a day

Ere a leaf is on a bush
In the time before the Thrush

Telling tales about the sun
When we 've little warmth , or none

Poets , vain men in their mood
Travel with the multitude

Joys to spy thee near her home
Spring is coming , Thou art come

Comfort have thou of thy merit
Kindly , unassuming Spirit

Howsoever mean it be
But 't is good enough for thee

Ill befal the yellow Flowers
Children of the flaring hours

Taken praise that should be thine
Little , humble Celandine

Prophet of delight and mirth
Scorn 'd and slighted upon earth

I will sing , as doth behove
Hymns in praise of what I love

Pleasures newly found are sweet
When they lie about our feet

Celandine ! and long ago
Praise of which I nothing know

I have not a doubt but he
Whosoe'er the man might be

Took the fancy from a glance
At thy glittering countenance

Soon as gentle breezes bring
News of winter 's vanishing

With the proudest Thou art there
Mantling in the tiny square

Often have I sigh 'd to measure
By myself a lonely pleasure

And thy arch and wily ways
And thy store of other praise

Blithe of heart , from week to week
Thou dost play at hide-and-seek

Bright as any of the train
When ye all are out again

Thou art not beyond the moon
But a thing `` beneath our shoon

If there be but three or four
Who will love my little Flower

Who is the happy Warrior ? Who is he
Whom every Man in arms should wish to be

-- It is the generous Spirit , who , when brought
Among the tasks of real life , hath wrought

Whose high endeavours are an inward light
That make the path before him always bright

Who , with a natural instinct to discern
What knowledge can perform , is diligent to learn

Abides by this resolve , and stops not there
But makes his moral being his prime care

Who , doom 'd to go in company with Pain
And Fear , and Bloodshed , miserable train

In face of these doth exercise a power
Which is our human-nature 's highest dower

Controls them and subdues , transmutes , bereaves
Of their bad influence , and their good receives

By objects , which might force the soul to abate
Her feeling , render 'd more compassionate

Is placable because occasions rise
So often that demand such sacrifice

More skilful in self-knowledge , even more pure
As tempted more ; more able to endure

As more expos 'd to suffering and distress
Thence , also , more alive to tenderness

Tis he whose law is reason ; who depends
Upon that law as on the best of friends

Whence , in a state where men are tempted still
To evil for a guard against worse ill

And what in quality or act is best
Doth seldom on a right foundation rest

He fixes good on good alone , and owes
To virtue every triumph that he knows

-- Who , if he rise to station of command
Rises by open means ; and there will stand

On honourable terms , or else retire
And in himself possess his own desire

Who comprehends his trust , and to the same
Keeps faithful with a singleness of aim

And therefore does not stoop , nor lie in wait
For wealth , or honors , or for worldly state

Whom they must follow ; on whose head must fall
Like showers of manna , if they come at all

Whose powers shed round him in the common strife
Or mild concerns of ordinary life

A constant influence , a peculiar grace
But who , if he be called upon to face

Some awful moment to which heaven has joined
Great issues , good or bad for human-kind

Is happy as a Lover ; and attired
With sudden brightness like a Man inspired

And through the heat of conflict keeps the law
In calmness made , and sees what he foresaw

Or if an unexpected call succeed
Come when it will , is equal to the need

-- He who , though thus endued as with a sense
And faculty for storm and turbulence

Is yet a Soul whose master bias leans
To home-felt pleasures and to gentle scenes

Sweet images ! which , wheresoe'er he be
Are at his heart ; and such fidelity

It is his darling passion to approve
More brave for this , that he hath much to love

'T is , finally , the Man , who , lifted high
Conspicuous object in a Nation 's eye

Who , with a toward or untoward lot
Prosperous or adverse , to his wish or not

Plays , in the many games of life , that one
Where what he most doth value must be won

Whom neither shape of danger can dismay
Nor thought of tender happiness betray

Who , not content that former worth stand fast
Looks forward , persevering to the last

Who , whether praise of him must walk the earth
For ever , and to noble deeds give birth

Or He must go to dust without his fame
And leave a dead unprofitable name

Finds comfort in himself and in his cause
And , while the mortal mist is gathering , draws

This is the happy Warrior ; this is He
Whom every Man in arms should wish to be

Horn it was which none could sound
No one upon living ground

Save He who came as rightful Heir
To Egremont 's Domains and Castle fair

Each at the appointed hour
Tried the Horn , it own 'd his power

He was acknowledged : and the blast
Which good Sir Eustace sounded was the last

Hear , then , and neglect me not
At this time , and on this spot

The words are utter 'd from my heart
As my last earnest prayer ere we depart

Hither come thou back straightway
Hubert , if alive that day

Return , and sound the Horn , that we
May have a living House still left in thee

So were both right well content
From the Castle forth they went

And at the head of their Array
To Palestine the Brothers took their way

Whence , then , could it come the thought
By what evil spirit brought

Oh ! can a brave Man wish to take
His Brother 's life , for Land 's and Castle 's sake

`` Take your earnings. '' -- Oh ! that I
Could have seen my Brother die

It was a pang that vex 'd him then
And oft returned , again , and yet again

To his Castle Hubert sped
He has nothing now to dread

But silent and by stealth he came
And at an hour which nobody could name

But bold Hubert lives in glee
Months and years went smilingly

With plenty was his table spread
And bright the Lady is who shares his bed

And , while thus in open day
Once he sate , as old books say

A blast was utter 'd from the Horn
Where by the Castle-gate it hung forlorn

Hubert ! though the blast be blown
He is helpless and alone

Thou hast a dungeon , speak the word
And there he may be lodg 'd , and thou be Lord

'T is Sir Eustace ; if it be
Living Man , it must be he

Thus Hubert thought in his dismay
And by a Postern-gate he slunk away

And by all the saints in heaven
And of Eustace was forgiv'n

Then in a Convent went to hide
His melancholy head , and there he died

Sons he had , saw Sons of theirs
And through ages , Heirs of Heirs

A long posterity renowned
Sounded the Horn which they alone could sound

Why am I ignorant of the same
That I may rest ; and neither blame

Sometimes with thoughts of very bliss
I catch at them , and then I miss

If things ensued that wanted grace
As hath been said , they were not base

He knows it not , he can not guess
Years to a Mother bring distress

As ever breathed : '' and that is true
I 've wet my path with tears like dew

I now can see with better eyes
And worldly grandeur I despise

Chains tie us down by land and sea
And wishes , vain as mine , may be

Or hast been summoned to the Deep
Thou , Thou and all thy mates , to keep

For , surely , then I should have sight
Of Him I wait for day and night

I question things , and do not find
One that will answer to my mind

Then come to me , my Son , or send
Some tidings that my woes may end

That way look , my Infant , lo
What a pretty baby show

See the Kitten on the Wall
Sporting with the leaves that fall

Wither 'd leaves , one , two , and three
From the lofty Elder-tree

Through the calm and frosty air
Of this morning bright and fair

Eddying round and round they sink
Softly , slowly : one might think

From the motions that are made
Every little leaf conveyed

Sylph or Faery hither tending
To this lower world descending

Each invisible and mute
In his wavering parachute

-- But the Kitten , how she starts
Crouches , stretches , paws , and darts

First at one and then it 's fellow
Just as light and just as yellow

There are many now -- now one
Now they stop ; and there are none

What intenseness of desire
In her upward eye of fire

With a tiger-leap half way
Now she meets the coming prey

Lets it go as fast , and then
Has it in her power again

Now she works with three or four
Like an Indian Conjuror

Quick as he in feats of art
Far beyond in joy of heart

Were her antics play 'd in the eye
Of a thousand Standers-by

Clapping hands with shout and stare
What would little Tabby care

For the plaudits of the Crowd
Over happy to be proud

Over wealthy in the treasure
Of her own exceeding pleasure

'T is a pretty Baby-treat
Nor , I deem , for me unmeet

Here , for neither Babe or me
Other Play-mate can I see

Of the countless living things
That with stir of feet and wings

( In the sun or under shade
Upon bough or grassy blade

And with busy revellings
Chirp and song , and murmurings

Made this Orchard 's narrow space
And this Vale so blithe a place

Multitudes are swept away
Never more to breathe the day

Some are sleeping ; some in Bands
Travell 'd into distant Lands

Others slunk to moor and wood
Far from human neighbourhood

And , among the Kinds that keep
With us closer fellowship

With us openly abide
All have laid their mirth aside

-- Where is he that giddy Sprite
Blue-cap , with his colours bright

Who was blest as bird could be
Feeding in the apple-tree

Made such wanton spoil and rout
Turning blossoms inside out

Hung with head towards the ground
Flutter 'd , perch 'd ; into a round

Lambs , that through the mountains went
Frisking , bleating merriment

When the year was in it 's prime
They are sober 'd by this time

If you look to vale or hill
If you listen , all is still

That from out the rocky ground
Strikes a solitary sound

Vainly glitters hill and plain
And the air is calm in vain

Vainly Morning spreads the lure
Of a sky serene and pure

Creature none can she decoy
Into open sign of joy

Is it that they have a fear
Of the dreary season near

Or that other pleasures be
Sweeter even than gaiety

Yet , whate'er enjoyments dwell
In the impenetrable cell

Of the silent heart which Nature
Furnishes to every Creature

Whatsoe'er we feel and know
Too sedate for outward show

Such a light of gladness breaks
Pretty Kitten ! from thy freaks

Spreads with such a living grace
O'er my little Laura 's face

Yes , the sight so stirs and charms
Thee , Baby , laughing in my arms

That almost I could repine
That your transports are not mine

That I do not wholly fare
Even as ye do , thoughtless Pair

And I will have my careless season
Spite of melancholy reason

Will walk through life in such a way
That , when time brings on decay

Now and then I may possess
Hours of perfect gladsomeness

-- Pleas 'd by any random toy
By a Kitten 's busy joy

Or an infant 's laughing eye
Sharing in the extacy

I would fare like that or this
Find my wisdom in my bliss

Keep the sprightly soul awake
And have faculties to take

Even from things by sorrow wrought
Matter for a jocund thought

Spite of care , and spite of grief
To gambol with Life 's falling Leaf

But he , bold Knight as ever fought
Their Father , took of them no thought

Sing , mournfully , oh ! mournfully
The Solitude of Binnorie

The Warriors leap upon the land
And hark ! the Leader of the Band

Sing , mournfully , oh ! mournfully
The Solitude of Binnorie

Away they fly to left to right
Of your fair household , Father Knight

Sing , mournfully , oh ! mournfully
The Solitude of Binnorie

The empty House when he comes home
For us your yellow ringlets comb

Sing , mournfully , oh ! mournfully
The Solitude of Binnorie

They ran , and with a desperate leap
Together plung 'd into the deep

Sing , mournfully , oh ! mournfully
The Solitude of Binnorie

The Fishers say , those Sisters fair
By Faeries are all buried there

Sing , mournfully , oh ! mournfully
The Solitude of Binnorie

Thou Faery Voyager ! that dost float
In such clear water , that thy Boat

May rather seem
To brood on air than on an earthly stream

Suspended in a stream as clear as sky
Where earth and heaven do make one imagery

O blessed Vision ! happy Child
That art so exquisitely wild

I think of thee with , many fears
For what may be thy lot in future years

Oh ! too industrious folly
Oh ! vain and causeless melancholy

Nature will either end thee quite
Or , lengthening out thy season of delight

What hast Thou to do with sorrow
Or the injuries of tomorrow

A Gem that glitters while it lives
And no forewarning gives

But , at the touch of wrong , without a strife
Slips in a moment out of life

Thou who art victory and law
When empty terrors overawe

From vain temptations dost set free
From strife and from despair ; a glorious ministry

Glad Hearts ! without reproach or blot
Who do thy work , and know it not

May joy be theirs while life shall last
And Thou , if they should totter , teach them to stand fast

And bless 'd are they who in the main
This faith , even now , do entertain

Live in the spirit of this creed
Yet find that other strength , according to their need

Resolved that nothing e'er should press
Upon my present happiness

I shoved unwelcome tasks away
But thee I now would serve more strictly , if I may

Me this uncharter 'd freedom tires
I feel the weight of chance desires

My hopes no more must change their name
I long for a repose which ever is the same

Not seeking in the school of pride
For `` precepts over dignified

Denial and restraint I prize
No farther than they breed a second Will more wise

Flowers laugh before thee on their beds
And Fragrance in thy footing treads

Thou dost preserve the Stars from wrong
And the most ancient Heavens through Thee are fresh and strong

Give unto me , made lowly wise
The spirit of self-sacrifice

The confidence of reason give
And in the light of truth thy Bondman let me live

What other dress she had I could not know
Only she wore a Cap that was as white as snow

To head those ancient Amazonian files
Or ruling Bandit 's Wife , among the Grecian Isles

And yet a boon I gave her ; for the Creature
Was beautiful to see ; a Weed of glorious feature

The Taller follow 'd with his hat in hand
Wreath 'd round with yellow flow'rs , the gayest of the land

Two Brothers seem 'd they , eight and ten years old
And like that Woman 's face as gold is like to gold

`` That can not be , '' one answer 'd , `` She is dead
`` Nay but I gave her pence , and she will buy you bread

`` Come , come ! '' cried one ; and , without more ado
Off to some other play they both together flew

Singing , singing
With all the heav'ns about thee ringing

Lift me , guide me , till I find
That spot which seems so to thy mind

I have walked through wildernesses dreary
And to-day my heart is weary

There is madness about thee , and joy divine
In that song of thine

Lift me , guide me high and high
To thy banqueting-place in the sky

Joyous as morning
Thou art laughing and scorning

And , though little troubled with sloth
Drunken Lark ! thou would'st be loth

Happy , happy Liver
With a soul as strong as a mountain river

Through prickly moors or dusty ways must wind
But hearing thee , or others of thy kind

I , with my fate contented , will plod on
And hope for higher raptures , when life 's day is done

Which they would stifle , move at such a pace
The Northern Wind , to call thee to the chace

The birds are singing in the distant woods
Over his own sweet voice the Stock-dove broods

The Jay makes answer as the Magpie chatters
And all the air is fill 'd with pleasant noise of waters

The Hare is running races in her mirth
And with her feet she from the plashy earth

Raises a mist ; which , glittering in the sun
Runs with her all the way , wherever she doth run

Or heard them not , as happy as a Boy
The pleasant season did my heart employ

My old remembrances went from me wholly
And all the ways of men , so vain and melancholy

In our dejection do we sink as low
To me that morning did it happen so

And fears , and fancies , thick upon me came
Dim sadness , & blind thoughts I knew not nor could name

Even as these blissful Creatures do I fare
Far from the world I walk , and from all care

But there may come another day to me
Solitude , pain of heart , distress , and poverty

To genial faith , still rich in genial good
But how can He expect that others should

Build for him , sow for him , and at his call
Love him , who for himself will take no heed at all

Behind his plough , upon the mountain-side
By our own spirits are we deified

We Poets in our youth begin in gladness
But thereof comes in the end despondency and madness

When up and down my fancy thus was driven
And I with these untoward thoughts had striven

I saw a Man before me unawares
The oldest Man he seem 'd that ever wore grey hairs

He stood alone : a minute 's space I guess
I watch 'd him , he continuing motionless

To the Pool 's further margin then I drew
He being all the while before me full in view

By what means it could thither come , and whence
So that it seems a thing endued with sense

Like a Sea-beast crawl 'd forth , which on a shelf
Of rock or sand reposeth , there to sun itself

Coming together in their pilgrimage
As if some dire constraint of pain , or rage

Of sickness felt by him in times long past
A more than human weight upon his frame had cast

Beside the little pond or moorish flood
Motionless as a Cloud the Old Man stood

That heareth not the loud winds when they call
And moveth altogether , if it move at all

As if he had been reading in a book
And now such freedom as I could I took

And , drawing to his side , to him did say
`` This morning gives us promise of a glorious day

`` What kind of work is that which you pursue
This is a lonesome place for one like you

He answer 'd me with pleasure and surprize
And there was , while he spake , a fire about his eyes

Choice word , and measured phrase ; above the reach
Of ordinary men ; a stately speech

Such as grave Livers do in Scotland use
Religious men , who give to God and Man their dues

And he had many hardships to endure
From Pond to Pond he roam 'd , from moor to moor

Housing , with God 's good help , by choice or chance
And in this way he gain 'd an honest maintenance

And the whole Body of the man did seem
Like one whom I had met with in a dream

Or like a Man from some far region sent
To give me human strength , and strong admonishment

And mighty Poets in their misery dead
And now , not knowing what the Old Man had said

My question eagerly did I renew
`` How is it that you live , and what is it you do

The waters of the Ponds where they abide
`` Once I could meet with them on every side

But they have dwindled long by slow decay
Yet still I persevere , and find them where I may

About the weary moors continually
Wandering about alone and silently

While I these thoughts within myself pursued
He , having made a pause , the same discourse renewed

I could have laugh 'd myself to scorn , to find
In that decrepit Man so firm a mind

`` God , '' said I , `` be my help and stay secure
I 'll think of the Leech-gatherer on the lonely moor

And Hermits are contented with their Cells
And Students with their pensive Citadels

Maids at the Wheel , the Weaver at his Loom
Sit blithe and happy ; Bees that soar for bloom

High as the highest Peak of Furness Fells
Will murmur by the hour in Foxglove bells

In sundry moods , 't was pastime to be bound
Within the Sonnet 's scanty plot of ground

Pleas 'd if some Souls ( for such there needs must be
Who have felt the weight of too much liberty

The wayward brain , to saunter through a wood
An old place , full of many a lovely brood

Tall trees , green arbours , and ground flowers in flocks
And Wild rose tip-toe upon hawthorn stocks

Like to a bonny Lass , who plays her pranks
At Wakes and Fairs with wandering Mountebanks

Festively she puts forth in trim array
As vigorous as a Lark at break of day

Is she for tropic suns , or polar snow
What boots the enquiry ? Neither friend nor foe

She cares for ; let her travel where she may
She finds familiar names , a beaten way

And , almost as it was when ships were rare
From time to time , like Pilgrims , here and there

We were too late at least by one dark hour
And nothing could we see of all that power

Of prospect , whereof many thousands tell
The western sky did recompence us well

With Grecian Temple , Minaret , and Bower
And , in one part , a Minster with its Tower

Even while mine eyes were on that solemn sight
A contrast and reproach to gross delight

And life 's unspiritual pleasures daily wooed
But now upon this thought I can not brood

It is unstable , and deserts me quite
Nor will I praise a Cloud , however bright

These twinklings of oblivion ? Thou dost love
To sit in meekness , like the brooding Dove

A Captive never wishing to be free
This tiresome night , O Sleep ! thou art to me

A Fly , that up and down himself doth shove
Upon a fretful rivulet , now above

One after one ; the sound of rain , and bees
Murmuring ; the fall of rivers , winds and seas

Smooth fields , white sheets of water , and pure sky
I 've thought of all by turns ; and still I lie

Sleepless ; and soon the small birds ' melodies
Must hear , first utter 'd from my orchard trees

And thou hast had thy store of tenderest names
The very sweetest words that fancy frames

When thankfulness of heart is strong and deep
Dear bosom Child we call thee , that dost steep

In rich reward all suffering ; Balm that tames
All anguish ; Saint that evil thoughts and aims

Like stars in heaven , and joyously it showed
Some lying fast at anchor in the road

Some veering up and down , one knew not why
A goodly Vessel did I then espy

Come like a Giant from a haven broad
And lustily along the Bay she strode

Are privileg 'd Inmates of deep solitude
Nor would the nicest Anchorite exclude

A Field or two of brighter green , or Plot
Of tillage-ground , that seemeth like a spot

Of stationary sunshine : thou hast viewed
These only , Duddon ! with their paths renewed

Who such Divinity to thee imparts
As hallows and makes pure all gentle hearts

With beauty , which is varying every hour
But , in chaste hearts uninfluenced by the power

When first they met the placid light of thine
And my Soul felt her destiny divine

And hope of endless peace in me grew bold
Heav'n-born , the Soul a heav'n-ward course must hold

Beyond the visible world She soars to seek
For what delights the sense is false and weak

In that which perishes : nor will he lend
His heart to aught which doth on time depend

If Thou the spirit give by which I pray
My unassisted heart is barren clay

Which of its native self can nothing feed
Of good and pious works thou art the seed

Which quickens only where thou say'st it may
Unless thou shew to us thine own true way

By which such virtue may in me be bred
That in thy holy footsteps I may tread

That I may have the power to sing of thee
And sound thy praises everlastingly

The Kine are couch 'd upon the dewy grass
The Horse alone , seen dimly as I pass

Is up , and cropping yet his later meal
Dark is the ground ; a slumber seems to steal

O'er vale , and mountain , and the starless sky
Now , in this blank of things , a harmony

That grief for which the senses still supply
Fresh food ; for only then , when memory

Is hush 'd , am I at rest . My Friends , restrain
Those busy cares that would allay my pain

Dull would he be of soul who could pass by
A sight so touching in it 's majesty

This City now doth like a garment wear
The beauty of the morning ; silent , bare

Ships , towers , domes , theatres , and temples lie
Open unto the fields , and to the sky

Those many records of my childish years
Remembrance of myself and of my peers

Will press me down : to think of what is gone
Will be an awful thought , if life have one

But , when into the Vale I came , no fears
Distress 'd me ; I look 'd round , I shed no tears

To see the Trees , which I had thought so tall
Mere dwarfs ; the Brooks so narrow , Fields so small

Which mists and vapours from mine eyes did shroud
Nor view of him who sate thereon allowed

But all the steps and ground about were strown
With sights the ruefullest that flesh and bone

Ever put on ; a miserable crowd
Sick , hale , old , young , who cried before that cloud

Sleeping alone within a mossy cave
With her face up to heaven ; that seem 'd to have

While I was framing beds for winter flowers
While I was planting green unfading bowers

And shrubs to hang upon the warm alcove
And sheltering wall ; and still , as fancy wove

The dream , to time and nature 's blended powers
I gave this paradise for winter hours

Getting and spending , we lay waste our powers
Little we see in nature that is ours

We have given our hearts away , a sordid boon
This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon

The Winds that will be howling at all hours
And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers

The holy time is quiet as a Nun
Breathless with adoration ; the broad sun

Listen ! the mighty Being is awake
And doth with his eternal motion make

Who may respect my name that I to thee
Ow 'd many years of early liberty

This care was thine when sickness did condemn
Thy youth to hopeless wasting , root and stem

That I , if frugal and severe , might stray
Where'er I liked ; and finally array

Star of my Country ! on the horizon 's brink
Thou hangest , stooping , as might seem , to sink

On England 's bosom ; yet well pleas 'd to rest
Meanwhile , and be to her a glorious crest

Conspicuous to the Nations . Thou , I think
Should'st be my Country 's emblem ; and should'st wink

Or what is it that ye go forth to see
Lords , Lawyers , Statesmen , Squires of low degree

Men known , and men unknown , Sick , Lame , and Blind
Post forward all , like Creatures of one kind

With first-fruit offerings crowd to bend the knee
In France , before the new-born Majesty

Travell 'd on foot together ; then this Way
Which I am pacing now , was like the May

With festivals of new-born Liberty
A homeless sound of joy was in the Sky

The antiquated Earth , as one might say
Beat like the heart of Man : songs , garlands , play

Two solitary greetings have I heard
`` _Good morrow , Citizen_ ! '' a hollow word

And an unthinking grief ! the vital blood
Of that Man 's mind what can it be ? What food

Fed his first hopes ? What knowledge could He gain
'T is not in battles that from youth we train

Books , leisure , perfect freedom , and the talk
Man holds with week-day man in the hourly walk

This is young Buonaparte 's natal day
And his is henceforth an established sway

Consul for life . With worship France proclaims
Her approbation , and with pomps and games

Heaven grant that other Cities may be gay
Calais is not : and I have bent my way

And was the safeguard of the West : the worth
Of Venice did not fall below her birth

Venice , the eldest Child of Liberty
She was a Maiden City , bright and free

No guile seduced , no force could violate
And when She took unto herself a Mate

To that great King ; shall hail the crowned Youth
Who , taking counsel of unbending Truth

By one example hath set forth to all
How they with dignity may stand ; or fall

If fall they must . Now , whither doth it tend
And what to him and his shall be the end

Of fortitude , and piety , and love
Which all his glorious Ancestors approve

Whether the rural Milk-maid by her Cow
Sing in thy hearing , or thou liest now

Alone in some deep dungeon 's earless den
O miserable chieftain ! where and when

Wilt thou find patience ? Yet die not ; do thou
Wear rather in thy bonds a chearful brow

That will forget thee ; thou hast great allies
Thy friends are exultations , agonies

From Calais with us , gaudy in array
A Negro Woman like a Lady gay

Yet silent as a woman fearing blame
Dejected , meek , yea pitiably tame

She sate , from notice turning not away
But on our proffer 'd kindness still did lay

Not one of whom may now find footing there
This the poor Out-cast did to us declare

The Cock that crows , the Smoke that curls , that sound
Of Bells , those Boys that in yon meadow-ground

In white sleev 'd shirts are playing by the score
And even this little River 's gentle roar

All , all are English . Oft have I look 'd round
With joy in Kent 's green vales ; but never found

And saw , while sea was calm and air was clear
The Coast of France , the Coast of France how near

Drawn almost into frightful neighbourhood
I shrunk , for verily the barrier flood

Was like a Lake , or River bright and fair
A span of waters ; yet what power is there

Strength to the brave , and Power , and Deity
Yet in themselves are nothing ! One decree

One of the Mountains ; each a mighty Voice
In both from age to age Thou didst rejoice

They were thy chosen Music , Liberty
There came a Tyrant , and with holy glee

Thou fought'st against Him ; but hast vainly striven
Thou from thy Alpine Holds at length art driven

Of one deep bliss thine ear hath been bereft
Then cleave , O cleave to that which still is left

That mountain Floods should thunder as before
And Ocean bellow from his rocky shore

For comfort , being , as I am , opprest
To think that now our Life is only drest

For shew ; mean handywork of craftsman , cook
Or groom ! We must run glittering like a Brook

In the open sunshine , or we are unblest
The wealthiest man among us is the best

This is idolatry ; and these we adore
Plain living and high thinking are no more

England hath need of thee : she is a fen
Of stagnant waters : altar , sword and pen

Fireside , the heroic wealth of hall and bower
Have forfeited their ancient English dower

Of inward happiness . We are selfish men
Oh ! raise us up , return to us again

Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea
Pure as the naked heavens , majestic , free

And tongues that utter 'd wisdom , better none
The later Sydney , Marvel , Harrington

Young Vane , and others who call 'd Milton Friend
These Moralists could act and comprehend

They knew how genuine glory was put on
Taught us how rightfully a nation shone

No single Volume paramount , no code
No master spirit , no determined road

Of British freedom , which to the open Sea
Of the world 's praise from dark antiquity

Hath flowed , `` with pomp of waters , unwithstood
Road by which all might come and go that would

And bear out freights of worth to foreign lands
That this most famous Stream in Bogs and Sands

The Student 's bower for gold , some fears unnamed
I had , my Country ! am I to be blamed

But , when I think of Thee , and what Thou art
Verily , in the bottom of my heart

Had blasted France , and made of it a land
Unfit for Men ; and that in one great Band

Her Sons were bursting forth , to dwell at ease
But 't is a chosen soil , where sun and breeze

Shed gentle favors ; rural works are there
And ordinary business without care

Of knowledge ; that whole myriads should unite
To work against themselves such fell despite

Than his who breathes , by roof , and floor , and wall
Pent in , a Tyrant 's solitary Thrall

'T is his who walks about in the open air
One of a Nation who , henceforth , must wear

Their fetters in their Souls . For who could be
Who , even the best , in such condition , free

Even rich men , brave by nature , taint the air
With words of apprehension and despair

While tens of thousands , thinking on the affray
Men unto whom sufficient for the day

And minds not stinted or untill 'd are given
Sound , healthy Children of the God of Heaven

That virtue and the faculties within
Are vital , and that riches are akin

Thy heart from its emasculating food
The truth should now be better understood

Old things have been unsettled ; we have seen
Fair seed-time , better harvest might have been

Therefore the wise pray for thee , though the freight
Of thy offences be a heavy weight

I see one Man , of Men the meanest too
Rais 'd up to sway the World , to do , undo

With mighty Nations for his Underlings
The great events with which old story rings

Seem vain and hollow ; I find nothing great
Nothing is left which I can venerate

Seems at the heart of all things . But , great God
I measure back the steps which I have trod

Of such poor Instruments , with thoughts sublime
I tremble at the sorrow of the time

Ye Children of a Soil that doth advance
It 's haughty brow against the coast of France

Now is the time to prove your hardiment
To France be words of invitation sent

They from their Fields can see the countenance
Of your fierce war , may ken the glittering lance

Tried Men , at Killicranky were arrayed
Against an equal Host that wore the Plaid

Shepherds and Herdsmen. -- Like a whirlwind came
The Highlanders , the slaughter spread like flame

And Garry thundering down his mountain-road
Was stopp 'd , and could not breathe beneath the load

On British ground the Invaders are laid low
The breath of Heaven has drifted them like snow

And left them lying in the silent sun
Never to rise again ! -- the work is done

Come forth , ye Old Men , now in peaceful show
And greet your Sons ! drums beat , and trumpets blow

That triumph , when the very worst , the pain
And even the prospect of our Brethren slain

Another mighty Empire overthrown
And we are left , or shall be left , alone

The last that dares to struggle with the Foe
'T is well ! from this day forward we shall know

That in ourselves our safety must be sought
That by our own right hands it must be wrought

Supplied , to him were more than mines of gold
Light was my sleep ; my days in transport rolled

High o'er the cliffs I led my fleecy store
A dizzy depth below ! his boat and twinkling oar

To lisp , he made me kneel beside my bed
And in his hearing there my prayers I said

For books in every neighbouring house I sought
And nothing to my mind a sweeter pleasure brought

The sabbath bells , and their delightful chime
The gambols and wild freaks at shearing time

The swans , that , when I sought the water-side
From far to meet me came , spreading their snowy pride

When the bees hummed , and chair by winter fire
When market-morning came , the neat attire

When stranger passed , so often I have checked
The red-breast known for years , which at my casement pecked

And cottage after cottage owned its sway
No joy to see a neighbouring house , or stray

He loved his old hereditary nook
And ill could I the thought of such sad parting brook

His troubles grew upon him day by day
Till all his substance fell into decay

All , all was seized , and weeping , side by side
We sought a home where we uninjured might abide

That on his marriage-day sweet music made
Till then he hoped his bones might there be laid

I could not pray : -- through tears that fell in showers
Glimmer 'd our dear-loved home , alas ! no longer ours

We two had sung , like little birds in May
When we began to tire of childish play

And I in truth did love him like a brother
For never could I hope to meet with such another

What tender vows our last sad kiss delayed
To him we turned : -- we had no other aid

He well could love in grief : his faith he kept
And in a quiet home once more my father slept

And often , viewing their sweet smiles , I sighed
And knew not why . My happy father died

The empty loom , cold hearth , and silent wheel
And tears that flowed for ills which patience could not heal

Beat round , to sweep the streets of want and pain
My husband 's arms now only served to strain

To join those miserable men he flew
And now to the sea-coast , with numbers more , we drew

By fever , from polluted air incurred
Ravage was made , for which no knell was heard

That happier days we never more must view
The parting signal streamed , at last the land withdrew

We gazed with terror on the gloomy sleep
Of them that perished in the whirlwind 's sweep

That we the mercy of the waves should rue
We reached the western world , a poor , devoted crew

Unseen , unheard , unwatched by any star
Or in the streets and walks where proud men are

Protract a curst existence , with the brood
That lap ( their very nourishment ! ) their brother 's blood

It would thy brain unsettle even to hear
All perished -- all , in one remorseless year

Dried up , despairing , desolate , on board
A British ship I waked , as from a trance restored

The very ocean has its hour of rest
That comes not to the human mourner 's breast

I looked and looked along the silent air
Until it seemed to bring a joy to my despair

The breathing pestilence that rose like smoke
The shriek that from the distant battle broke

To loathsome vaults , where heart-sick anguish tossed
Hope died , and fear itself in agony was lost

And Fire from Hell reared his gigantic shape
And Murder , by the ghastly gleam , and Rape

-- For weeks the balmy air breathed soft and mild
And on the gliding vessel Heaven and Ocean smiled

The impatient mariner the sail unfurled
And whistling , called the wind that hardly curled

For me -- farthest from earthly port to roam
Was best , could I but shun the spot where man might come

Roaming the illimitable waters round
Here watch , of every human friend disowned

And homeless near a thousand homes I stood
And near a thousand tables pined , and wanted food

Nor dared my hand at any door to knock
I lay , where with his drowsy mates , the cock

At morn my sick heart hunger scarcely stung
Nor to the beggar 's language could I frame my tongue

Near the sea-side I reached a ruined fort
There , pains which nature could no more support

Of hideous sense ; I sunk , nor step could crawl
And thence was borne away to neighbouring hospital

Of many things which never troubled me
Of feet still bustling round with busy glee

Fretting the fever round the languid heart
And groans , which , as they said , would make a dead man start

Dismissed , again on open day I gazed
At houses , men , and common light , amazed

The wild brood saw me weep , my fate enquired
And gave me food , and rest , more welcome , more desired

And their long holiday that feared not grief
For all belonged to all , and each was chief

In every vale for their delight was stowed
For them , in nature 's meads , the milky udder flowed

And other joys my fancy to allure
The bag-pipe dinning on the midnight moor

In depth of forest glade , when jocund June
Rolled fast along the sky his warm and genial moon

Or hang on tiptoe at the lifted latch
The gloomy lantern , and the dim blue match

Were not for me , brought up in nothing ill
Besides , on griefs so fresh my thoughts were brooding still

Small help , and , after marriage such as mine
With little kindness would to me incline

By high-way side forgetful would I sit
Whole hours , my idle arms in moping sorrow knit

Now coldly given , now utterly refused
The fields I for my bed have often used

Foregone the home delight of constant truth
And clear and open soul , so prized in fearless youth

And now across this moor my steps I bend
Oh ! tell me whither -- for no earthly friend

She wept ; -- because she had no more to say
Of that perpetual weight which on her spirit lay

'T was throwing words away ; for still
The little Maid would have her will

In distant countries I have been
And yet I have not often seen

A healthy man , a man full grown
Weep in the public roads alone

Sturdy he seemed , though he was sad
And in his arms a lamb he had

He saw me , and he turned aside
As if he wished himself to hide

Then with his coat he made essay
To wipe those briny tears away

To-day I fetched him from the rock
He is the last of all my flock

When I was young , a single man
And after youthful follies ran

Though little given to care and thought
Yet , so it was , a ewe I bought

Of sheep I number 'd a full score
And every year encreas 'd my store

Year after year my stock it grew
And from this one , this single ewe

Full fifty comely sheep I raised
As sweet a flock as ever grazed

And now I care not if we die
And perish all of poverty

Ten children , Sir ! had I to feed
Hard labour in a time of need

My pride was tamed , and in our grief
I of the parish ask 'd relief

`` Do this ; how can we give to you
They cried , `` what to the poor is due

I sold a sheep as they had said
And bought my little children bread

And they were healthy with their food
For me it never did me good

To see it melt like snow away
For me it was a woeful day

Another still ! and still another
A little lamb , and then its mother

It was a vein that never stopped
Like blood-drops from my heart they dropped

They dwindled one by one away
For me it was a woeful day

To wicked deeds I was inclined
And wicked fancies cross 'd my mind

And every man I chanc 'd to see
I thought he knew some ill of me

Oft-times I thought to run away
For me it was a woeful day

Sir ! 't was a precious flock to me
As dear as my own children be

For daily with my growing store
I loved my children more and more

And every week , and every day
My flock , it seemed to melt away

They dwindled , Sir , sad sight to see
From ten to five , from five to three

A lamb , a weather , and a ewe
And then at last , from three to two

To-day I fetched it from the rock
It is the last of all my flock

Her eyes are wild , her head is bare
The sun has burnt her coal-black hair

Her eye-brows have a rusty stain
And she came far from over the main

She talked and sung the woods among
And it was in the English tongue

`` Sweet babe ! they say that I am mad
But nay , my heart is far too glad

And I am happy when I sing
Full many a sad and doleful thing

To thee I know too much I owe
I can not work thee any woe

A fire was once within my brain
And in my head a dull , dull pain

And fiendish faces one , two , three
Hung at my breasts , and pulled at me

Oh joy for me that sight to see
For he was here , and only he

Suck , little babe , oh suck again
It cools my blood ; it cools my brain

Thy lips I feel them , baby ! they
Draw from my heart the pain away

The breeze I see is in the tree
It comes to cool my babe and me

Oh ! love me , love me , little boy
Thou art thy mother 's only joy

And do not dread the waves below
When o'er the sea-rock 's edge we go

Then happy lie , for blest am I
Without me my sweet babe would die

Then do not fear , my boy ! for thee
Bold as a lion I will be

And I will always be thy guide
Through hollow snows and rivers wide

My pretty thing ! then thou shalt sing
As merry as the birds in spring

Thy father cares not for my breast
'T is thine , sweet baby , there to rest

'T is all thine own ! and if its hue
Be changed , that was so fair to view

'T is well for me ; thou canst not see
How pale and wan it else would be

Dread not their taunts , my little life
I am thy father 's wedded wife

And underneath the spreading tree
We two will live in honesty

And every day we two will pray
For him that 's gone and far away

I 'll teach my boy the sweetest things
I 'll teach him how the owlet sings

My little babe ! thy lips are still
And thou hast almost suck 'd thy fill

If thou art mad , my pretty lad
Then I must be for ever sad

Oh ! smile on me , my little lamb
For I thy own dear mother am

My love for thee has well been tried
I 've sought thy father far and wide

Now laugh and be gay , to the woods away
And there , my babe ; we 'll live for aye

Before I see another day
Oh let my body die away

In sleep I heard the northern gleams
The stars they were among my dreams

Before I see another day
Oh let my body die away

My fire is dead : it knew no pain
Yet is it dead , and I remain

All stiff with ice the ashes lie
And they are dead , and I will die

Then here contented will I lie
Alone I can not fear to die

Alas ! you might have dragged me on
Another day , a single one

Too soon despair o'er me prevailed
Too soon my heartless spirit failed

For strong and without pain I lay
My friends , when you were gone away

My child ! they gave thee to another
A woman who was not thy mother

When from my arms my babe they took
On me how strangely did he look

And then he stretched his arms , how wild
Oh mercy ! like a little child

My little joy ! my little pride
In two days more I must have died

Then do not weep and grieve for me
I feel I must have died with thee

Too soon , my friends , you went away
For I had many things to say

I 'll follow you across the snow
You travel heavily and slow

In spite of all my weary pain
I 'll look upon your tents again

For ever left alone am I
Then wherefore should I fear to die

My journey will be shortly run
I shall not see another sun

I can not lift my limbs to know
If they have any life or no

I feel my body die away
I shall not see another day

My lute , awake ! perform the last
Labor that thou and I shall waste

As to be heard where ear is none
As lead to grave in marble stone

The rock doth not so cruelly
Repulse the waves continually

Proud of the spoil that thou hast got
Of simple hearts thorough Love 's shot

Vengeance shall fall on thy disdain
That makest but game of earnest pain

May chance thee lie withered and old
In winter nights , that are so cold

And then may chance thee to repent
The time that thou hast lost and spent

Now cease , my lute ! This is the last
Labor that thou and I shall waste

Say nay , say nay , for shame
-- To save thee from the blame

That hath loved thee so long
In wealth and woe among

That hath given thee my heart
Never for to depart

And have no more pitye
Of him that loveth thee

Amid the press of worldly looks to waste
Hath with it joined oft times such bitter taste

That whoso joyes such kind of life to hold
In prison joyes , fettered with chains of gold

That now are wild , and do not remember
That sometime they put themselves in danger

To take bread at my hand ; and now they range
Busily seeking with a continual change

When her loose gown from her shoulders did fall
And she me caught in her arms long and small

And therewith all sweetly did me kiss
And softly said , `` Dear heart , how like you this

And I have leave to go , of her goodness
And she also to use newfangleness

But since that I so kindely am served
I fain sould know what she hath deserved

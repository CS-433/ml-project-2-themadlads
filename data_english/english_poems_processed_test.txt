Heart , that you 're weeping yet for Paradise
Do they still whisper , the old weary cries

Exile of immortality , strongly wise
Strain through the dark with undesirous eyes

I cower to the earth , I waking , I only
High and cold thou dreamest , O queen , high-dreaming and lonely

The white one flame , and the night-long crying
The viewless passers ; the world 's low sighing

With desire , with yearning
To the fire unburning

To the heatless fire , to the flameless ecstasy
Helpless I lie

And around me the feet of thy watchers tread
There is a rumour and a radiance of wings above my head

All the earth grows fire
White lips of desire

Dewy paths full of comfort . And radiant bands
The gracious presence of friendly hands

Help the blind one , the glad one , who stumbles and strays
Stretching wavering hands , up , up , through the praise

And heard the waves , and the seagull 's mocking cry
And in them all was only the old cry

O silly lover
And I was tired and sick that all was over

For all my thinking , never could recover
One moment of the good hours that were over

Then from the sad west turning wearily
I saw the pines against the white north sky

Their sharp black heads against a quiet sky
And there was peace in them ; and I

And laughed , and did no longer wish to die
Being glad of you , O pine-trees and the sky

Through unknown glooms , that frail black coffin -- and therein
God 's little pitiful Body lying , worn and thin

Till it was no more visible ; then turned again
With sorrowful quiet faces downward to the plain

The crowd 's good laughter , the loved eyes of men
I am drawn nightward ; I must turn again

She was wrinkled and huge and hideous ? She was our Mother
She was lustful and lewd ? -- but a God ; we had none other

In the day She was hidden and dumb , but at nightfall moaned in the shade
We shuddered and gave Her Her will in the darkness ; we were afraid

She was hungry and ate our children ; -- how should we stay Her
She took our young men and our maidens ; -- ours to obey Her

We were loathed and mocked and reviled of all nations ; that was our pride
She fed us , protected us , loved us , and killed us ; now She has died

What light of unremembered skies
Hast thou relumed within our eyes

Thou whom we seek , whom we shall find
A certain odour on the wind

Thy hidden face beyond the west
These things have called us ; on a quest

Older than any road we trod
More endless than desire.Far God

Sigh with thy cruel voice , that fills
The soul with longing for dim hills

And faint horizons ! For there come
Grey moments of the antient dumb

Sickness of travel , when no song
Can cheer us ; but the way seems long

And one remembers Ah ! the beat
Of weary unreturning feet

And songs of pilgrims unreturning
The fires we left are always burning

On the old shrines of home . Our kin
Have built them temples , and therein

Pray to the Gods we know ; and dwell
In little houses lovable

Being happy ( we remember how
And peaceful even to death O Thou

God of all long desirous roaming
Our hearts are sick of fruitless homing

And crying after lost desire
Hearten us onward ! as with fire

Consuming dreams of other bliss
The best Thou givest , giving this

Sufficient thing -- to travel still
Over the plain , beyond the hill

Unhesitating through the shade
Amid the silence unafraid

Till , at some sudden turn , one sees
Against the black and muttering trees

Thine altar , wonderfully white
Among the Forests of the Night

Come away ! Come away
Ye are sober and dull through the common day

It is shameful night , and God is asleep
( Have you not felt the quick fires that creep

The house is dumb
The night calls out to you . Come , ah , come

Naked , crawling on hands and feet
-- It is meet ! it is meet

But Love was as a flame about my feet
Proud up the Golden Stair I strode ; and beat

One of them wakes , and spits , and sleeps again
The darkness shivers . A wan light through the rain

Strikes on our faces , drawn and white . Somewhere
A new day sprawls ; and , inside , the foul air

Is chill , and damp , and fouler than before
Opposite me two Germans sweat and snore

Ah ! the long road ! and you so far away
Oh , I 'll remember ! but . . . each crawling day

Some day I shall rise and leave my friends
And seek you again through the world 's far ends

You whom I found so fair
( Touch of your hands and smell of your hair

My eager feet shall find you again
Though the sullen years and the mark of pain

Have changed you wholly ; for I shall know
( How could I forget having loved you so

In the sad half-light of evening
The face that was all my sunrising

So then at the ends of the earth I 'll stand
And hold you fiercely by either hand

And seeing your age and ashen hair
I 'll curse the thing that once you were

Because it is changed and pale and old
( Lips that were scarlet , hair that was gold

And I loved you before you were old and wise
When the flame of youth was strong in your eyes

And turn , and toss your brown delightful head
Amusedly , among the ancient Dead

Pleasure 's not theirs , nor pain . They doubt , and sigh
And do not love at all . Of these am I

One last shame 's spared me , one black word 's unspoken
And I 'm alone ; and you have not awoken

When love has changed to kindliness
Oh , love , our hungry lips , that press

Nodding in heaven , and whisper stuff
Seven million years were not enough

Less than the breath of children playing
A blasphemy scarce worth the saying

Tendered in habit ( once a flame
All heaven sang out to ) wakes the shame

We 'll have , -- THAT day , what shall we do
Being so noble , kill the two

That time when all is over , and
Hand never flinches , brushing hand

And blood lies quiet , for all you 're near
And it 's but spoken words we hear

Where trumpets sang ; when the mere skies
Are stranger and nobler than your eyes

And flesh is flesh , was flame before
And infinite hungers leap no more

In the chance swaying of your dress
And love has changed to kindliness

In a cool curving world he lies
And ripples with dark ecstasies

The kind luxurious lapse and steal
Shapes all his universe to feel

And know and be ; the clinging stream
Closes his memory , glooms his dream

Who lips the roots o ' the shore , and glides
Superb on unreturning tides

Those silent waters weave for him
A fluctuant mutable world and dim

Where wavering masses bulge and gape
Mysterious , and shape to shape

Dies momently through whorl and hollow
And form and line and solid follow

Solid and line and form to dream
Fantastic down the eternal stream

An obscure world , a shifting world
Bulbous , or pulled to thin , or curled

Or serpentine , or driving arrows
Or serene slidings , or March narrows

There slipping wave and shore are one
And weed and mud . No ray of sun

But glow to glow fades down the deep
( As dream to unknown dream in sleep

Shaken translucency illumes
The hyaline of drifting glooms

The strange soft-handed depth subdues
Drowned colour there , but black to hues

As death to living , decomposes
Red darkness of the heart of roses

Blue brilliant from dead starless skies
And gold that lies behind the eyes

The unknown unnameable sightless white
That is the essential flame of night

Lustreless purple , hooded green
The myriad hues that lie between

Darkness and darkness ! . And all 's one
Gentle , embracing , quiet , dun

The world he rests in , world he knows
Perpetual curving . Only -- grows

An eddy in that ordered falling
A knowledge from the gloom , a calling

Weed in the wave , gleam in the mud
The dark fire leaps along his blood

Dateless and deathless , blind and still
The intricate impulse works its will

His woven world drops back ; and he
Sans providence , sans memory

Unconscious and directly driven
Fades to some dank sufficient heaven

O world of lips , O world of laughter
Where hope is fleet and thought flies after

Of lights in the clear night , of cries
That drift along the wave and rise

Thin to the glittering stars above
You know the hands , the eyes of love

The strife of limbs , the sightless clinging
The infinite distance , and the singing

Blown by the wind , a flame of sound
The gleam , the flowers , and vast around

The horizon , and the heights above
You know the sigh , the song of love

But there the night is close , and there
Darkness is cold and strange and bare

And the secret deeps are whisperless
And rhythm is all deliciousness

And joy is in the throbbing tide
Whose intricate fingers beat and glide

In felt bewildering harmonies
Of trembling touch ; and music is

The exquisite knocking of the blood
Space is no more , under the mud

His bliss is older than the sun
Silent and straight the waters run

The lights , the cries , the willows dim
And the dark tide are one with him

How can we find ? how can we rest ? how can
We , being gods , win joy , or peace , being man

We , the gaunt zanies of a witless Fate
Who love the unloving and lover hate

Forget the moment ere the moment slips
Kiss with blind lips that seek beyond the lips

Who want , and know not what we want , and cry
With crooked mouths for Heaven , and throw it by

Love 's for completeness ! No perfection grows
'Twixt leg , and arm , elbow , and ear , and nose

And joint , and socket ; but unsatisfied
Sprawling desires , shapeless , perverse , denied

Finger with finger wreathes ; we love , and gape
Fantastic shape to mazed fantastic shape

Straggling , irregular , perplexed , embossed
Grotesquely twined , extravagantly lost

By crescive paths and strange protuberant ways
From sanity and from wholeness and from grace

How can love triumph , how can solace be
Where fever turns toward fever , knee toward knee

Could we but fill to harmony , and dwell
Simple as our thought and as perfectible

Rise disentangled from humanity
Strange whole and new into simplicity

Grow to a radiant round love , and bear
Unfluctuant passion for some perfect sphere

Love moon to moon unquestioning , and be
Like the star Lunisequa , steadfastly

Following the round clear orb of her delight
Patiently ever , through the eternal night

And country eyes , and quiet faces
All these were round my steady paces

Saw hands that beckoned , shone , were gone
In the green and gold . And I went on

From tree to tree , and distantly
Followed me , followed me

I turned , slipped in and out of sight
I trod as quiet as the night

And bowed , slid in , and sighed and curled
Hidden at rest from all the world

Meward a sound of shaken boughs
And ceased , above my intricate house

Calm clouds of scent , that I did weep
And stroked my face . I fell asleep

Laughed in the sun , and kissed the lovely grass
You said , `` Through glory and ecstasy we pass

Life is our cry . We have kept the faith ! '' we said
`` We shall go down with unreluctant tread

And laughed , that had such brave true things to say
-- And then you suddenly cried , and turned away

In love , in faith unbroken dwell
Friends radiant and inseparable

THAT IN HIS LONE OBSCURE DISTRESS
EACH WALKETH IN A WILDERNESS

I heard the thin gnat-voices cry
Star to faint star , across the sky

He lies
And waits ; and once in timeless sick surmise

Through the dead air heaves up an unknown hand
Like a dry branch . No life is in that land

They did not know his hymns
Were silence ; and her limbs

That had served Love so well
Dust , and a filthy smell

Each his own tiny face
And in that long embrace

Feel lip and breast grow warm
To breast and lip and arm

And knew , so closely pressed
Chill air on lip and breast

And , with a sick surprise
The emptiness of eyes

For the woods and hills that I never knew
The more excellent way 's yet mine ! And you

We talk as of old ; as of old you go
Out under the sky , and laughing , I know

Smiles you welcome there ; the woods that love you
Close lovely and conquering arms above you

And still in the white neat bed I strive
Most impotently against that gyve

Being less now than a thought , even
To you alone with your hills and heaven

To Priam 's palace , sword in hand , to sate
On that adulterous whore a ten years ' hate

Till the still innermost chamber fronted him
He swung his sword , and crashed into the dim

And that her neck curved down in such a way
And he felt tired . He flung the sword away

That journey home , the long connubial years
He does not tell you how white Helen bears

Child on legitimate child , becomes a scold
Haggard with virtue . Menelaus bold

Waxed garrulous , and sacked a hundred Troys
'Twixt noon and supper . And her golden voice

So Menelaus nagged ; and Helen cried
And Paris slept on by Scamander side

When I see you , who were so wise and cool
Gazing with silly sickness on that fool

You 've given your love to , your adoring hands
Touch his so intimately that each understands

I know , most hidden things ; and when I know
Your holiest dreams yield to the stupid bow

Of his red lips , and that the empty grace
Of those strong legs and arms , that rosy face

Has beaten your heart to such a flame of love
That you have given him every touch and move

Wrinkle and secret of you , all your life
-- Oh ! then I know I 'm waiting , lover-wife

For the great time when love is at a close
And all its fruit 's to watch the thickening nose

And sweaty neck and dulling face and eye
That are yours , and you , most surely , till you die

Day after day you 'll sit with him and note
The greasier tie , the dingy wrinkling coat

As prettiness turns to pomp , and strength to fat
And love , love , love to habit ! And after that

When all that 's fine in man is at an end
And you , that loved young life and clean , must tend

A foul sick fumbling dribbling body and old
When his rare lips hang flabby and ca n't hold

Slobber , and you 're enduring that worst thing
Senility 's queasy furtive love-making

And searching those dear eyes for human meaning
Propping the bald and helpless head , and cleaning

A scrap that life 's flung by , and love 's forgotten
Then you 'll be tired ; and passion dead and rotten

And he 'll be dirty , dirty ! O lithe and free
And lightfoot , that the poor heart cries to see

That 's how I 'll see your man and you ! -- But you
-- Oh , when THAT time comes , you 'll be dirty too

When you were there , and you , and you
Happiness crowned the night ; I too

Laughing and looking , one of all
I watched the quivering lamplight fall

On plate and flowers and pouring tea
And cup and cloth ; and they and we

Flung all the dancing moments by
With jest and glitter . Lip and eye

Flashed on the glory , shone and cried
Improvident , unmemoried

And fitfully and like a flame
The light of laughter went and came

Proud in their careless transience moved
The changing faces that I loved

Till suddenly , and otherwhence
I looked upon your innocence

For lifted clear and still and strange
From the dark woven flow of change

Under a vast and starless sky
I saw the immortal moment lie

One instant I , an instant , knew
As God knows all . And it and you

I , above Time , oh , blind ! could see
In witless immortality

Hung on the air , an amber stream
I saw the fire 's unglittering gleam

The painted flame , the frozen smoke
No more the flooding lamplight broke

On flying eyes and lips and hair
But lay , but slept unbroken there

On stiller flesh , and body breathless
And lips and laughter stayed and deathless

And words on which no silence grew
Light was more alive than you

For suddenly , and otherwhence
I looked on your magnificence

I saw the stillness and the light
And you , august , immortal , white

Holy and strange ; and every glint
Posture and jest and thought and tint

Freed from the mask of transiency
Triumphant in eternity

Dazed at length
Human eyes grew , mortal strength

Wearied ; and Time began to creep
Change closed about me like a sleep

Light glinted on the eyes I loved
The cup was filled . The bodies moved

The drifting petal came to ground
The laughter chimed its perfect round

The broken syllable was ended
And I , so certain and so friended

How could I cloud , or how distress
The heaven of your unconsciousness

Or shake at Time 's sufficient spell
Stammering of lights unutterable

The eternal holiness of you
The timeless end , you never knew

The peace that lay , the light that shone
You never knew that I had gone

A million miles away , and stayed
A million years . The laughter played

Unbroken round me ; and the jest
Flashed on . And we that knew the best

Down wonderful hours grew happier yet
I sang at heart , and talked , and eat

And lived from laugh to laugh , I too
When you were there , and you , and you

Amazed with sorrow . Down the morning one
Far golden horn in the gold of trees and sun

Forgot to dance . Dumb lay the unfalling stream
Life one eternal instant rose in dream

And still the sick ship rolls . 'T is hard , I tell ye
To choose 'twixt love and nausea , heart and belly

Long roads across a gleaming empty sky
Outcast and doomed and driven , you and I

Alone , serene beyond all love or hate
Terror or triumph , were content to wait

We , silent and all-knowing . Suddenly
Swept through the heaven low-crouching from on high

Great Hopes gold-armoured , jester Fantasies
And pilgrim Dreams , and little beggar Sighs

AH ! not now , when desire burns , and the wind calls , and the suns of spring
Light-foot dance in the woods , whisper of life , woo me to wayfaring

Ah ! not now should you come , now when the road beckons , and good friends call
Where are songs to be sung , fights to be fought , yea ! and the best of all

Love , on myriad lips fairer than yours , kisses you could not give
Dearest , why should I mourn , whimper , and whine , I that have yet to live

Sorrow will I forget , tears for the best , love on the lips of you
Now , when dawn in the blood wakes , and the sun laughs up the eastern blue

IÃ•ll forget and be glad ! Only at length , dear , when the great day ends
When love dies with the last light , and the last song has been sung , and friends

All are perished , and gloom strides on the heaven : then , as alone I lie
Ã•Mid DeathÃ•s gathering winds , frightened and dumb , sick for the past , may I

Feel you suddenly there , cool at my brow ; then may I hear the peace
Of your voice at the last , whispering love , calling , ere all can cease

In the silence of death ; then may I see dimly , and know , a space
Bending over me , last light in the dark , once , as of old , your face

HERE the flame that was ash , shrine that was void , lost in the haunted wood
I have tended and loved , year upon year , I in the solitude

Waiting , quiet and glad-eyed in the dark , knowing that once a gleam
Glowed and went through the wood . Still I abode strong in a golden dream

Unrecaptured . For I , I that had faith , knew that a face would glance
One day , white in the dim woods , and a voice call , and a radiance

Fill the grove , and the fire suddenly leapÃ‰ and , in the heart of it
End of labouring , you ! Therefore I kept ready the altar , lit

The flame , burning apart . Face of my dreams vainly in vision white
Gleaming down to me , lo ! hopeless I rise now . For about midnight

Whispers grew through the wood suddenly , strange cries in the boughs above
Grated , cries like a laugh . Silent and black then through the sacred grove

Great birds flew , as a dream , troubling the leaves , passing at length . I knew
Long expected and long loved , that afar , God of the dim wood , you

Somewhere lay , as a child sleeping , a child suddenly reft from mirth
White and wonderful yet , white in your youth , stretched upon foreign earth

God , immortal and dead ! Therefore I go ; never to rest , or win
Peace , and worship of you more , and the dumb wood and the shrine therein

So light we were , so right we were , so fair faith shone
And the way was laid so certainly , that , when I 'd gone

What dumb thing looked up at you ? Was it something heard
Or a sudden cry , that meekly and without a word

You broke the faith , and strangely , weakly , slipped apart
You gave in -- you , the proud of heart , unbowed of heart

Was this , friend , the end of all that we could do
And have you found the best for you , the rest for you

Did you learn so suddenly ( and I not by
Some whispered story , that stole the glory from the sky

And ended all the splendid dream , and made you go
So dully from the fight we know , the light we know

O faithless ! the faith remains , and I must pass
Gay down the way , and on alone . Under the grass

You wait ; the breeze moves in the trees , and stirs , and calls
And covers you with white petals , with light petals

There it shall crumble , frail and fair , under the sun
O little heart , your brittle heart ; till day be done

And the shadows gather , falling light , and , white with dew
Whisper , and weep ; and creep to you . Good sleep to you

Safe though all safety 's lost ; safe where men fall
And if these poor limbs die , safest of all

There 's none of these so lonely and poor of old
But , dying , has made us rarer gifts than gold

Of work and joy , and that unhoped serene
That men call age ; and those who would have been

There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter
And lit by the rich skies , all day . And after

And that no-place which gave them birth , shall close
The rainbow and the rose

Musing upon them ; as a mother , who
Has watched her children all the rich day through

Sits , quiet-handed , in the fading light
When children sleep , ere night

Then , oh ! then , the wise agree
Comes our immortality

Mamua , there waits a land
Hard for us to understand

There is the Face , whose ghosts we are
The real , the never-setting Star

Instead of lovers , Love shall be
For hearts , Immutability

And my laughter , and my pain
Shall home to the Eternal Brain

CoralÃ•s hues and rainbows there
And TeÅ¸raÃ•s braided hair

And dawns of pearl and gold and red
Mamua , your lovelier head

Divinely down the scented shade
Where feet to Ambulation fade

How shall we wind these wreaths of ours
Where there are neither heads nor flowers

And in the waterÃ•s soft caress
Wash the mind of foolishness

Well this side of Paradise
ThereÃ•s little comfort in the wise

In your arms was still delight
Quiet as a street at night

And thoughts of you , I do remember
Were green leaves in a darkened chamber

Were dark clouds in a moonless sky
Love , in you , went passing by

Penetrative , remote , and rare
Like a bird in the wide air

And , as the bird , it left no trace
In the heaven of your face

In your stupidity I found
The sweet hush after a sweet sound

All about you was the light
That dims the greying end of night

Desire was the unrisen sun
Joy the day not yet begun

With tree whispering to tree
Without wind , quietly

Wisdom slept within your hair
And Long-Suffering was there

And , in the flowing of your dress
Undiscerning Tenderness

And when you thought , it seemed to me
Infinitely , and like a sea

About the slight world you had known
Your vast unconsciousness was thrown

O haven without wave or tide
Silence , in which all songs have died

Holy book , where hearts are still
And home at length under the hill

O mother quiet , breasts of peace
Where love itself would faint and cease

O infinite deep I never knew
I would come back , come back to you

Find you , as a pool unstirred
Kneel down by you , and never a word

Lay my head , and nothing said
In your hands , ungarlanded

And a long watch you would keep
And I should sleep , and I should sleep

I have been so great a lover : filled my days
So proudly with the splendour of Love 's praise

The pain , the calm , and the astonishment
Desire illimitable , and still content

And all dear names men use , to cheat despair
For the perplexed and viewless streams that bear

Our hearts at random down the dark of life
Now , ere the unthinking silence on that strife

Steals down , I would cheat drowsy Death so far
My night shall be remembered for a star

That outshone all the suns of all men 's days
Shall I not crown them with immortal praise

Whom I have loved , who have given me , dared with me
High secrets , and in darkness knelt to see

The inenarrable godhead of delight
Love is a flame ; -- we have beaconed the world 's night

A city : -- and we have built it , these and I
An emperor : -- we have taught the world to die

So , for their sakes I loved , ere I go hence
And the high cause of Love 's magnificence

And to keep loyalties young , I 'll write those names
Golden for ever , eagles , crying flames

And set them as a banner , that men may know
To dare the generations , burn , and blow

Out on the wind of Time , shining and streaming
These I have loved : White plates and cups , clean-gleaming

Ringed with blue lines ; and feathery , faery dust
Wet roofs , beneath the lamp-light ; the strong crust

Of friendly bread ; and many-tasting food
Rainbows ; and the blue bitter smoke of wood

And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers
And flowers themselves , that sway through sunny hours

Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon
Then , the cool kindliness of sheets , that soon

Smooth away trouble ; and the rough male kiss
Of blankets ; grainy wood ; live hair that is

Shining and free ; blue-massing clouds ; the keen
Unpassioned beauty of a great machine

The benison of hot water ; furs to touch
The good smell of old clothes ; and other such

The comfortable smell of friendly fingers
Hair 's fragrance , and the musty reek that lingers

About dead leaves and last year 's ferns Dear names
And thousand other throng to me ! Royal flames

Sweet water 's dimpling laugh from tap or spring
Holes in the ground ; and voices that do sing

Voices in laughter , too ; and body 's pain
Soon turned to peace ; and the deep-panting train

Firm sands ; the little dulling edge of foam
That browns and dwindles as the wave goes home

And washen stones , gay for an hour ; the cold
Graveness of iron ; moist black earthen mould

Sleep ; and high places ; footprints in the dew
And oaks ; and brown horse-chestnuts , glossy-new

And new-peeled sticks ; and shining pools on grass
All these have been my loves . And these shall pass

Whatever passes not , in the great hour
Nor all my passion , all my prayers , have power

To hold them with me through the gate of Death
They 'll play deserter , turn with the traitor breath

Break the high bond we made , and sell Love 's trust
And sacramented covenant to the dust

-- -- Oh , never a doubt but , somewhere , I shall wake
And give what 's left of love again , and make

New friends , now strangers . But the best I 've known
Stays here , and changes , breaks , grows old , is blown

About the winds of the world , and fades from brains
Of living men , and dies . Nothing remains

O dear my loves , O faithless , once again
This one last gift I give : that after men

Shall know , and later lovers , far-removed
Praise you , `` All these were lovely '' ; say , `` He loved

Fish ( fly-replete , in depth of June
Dawdling away their wat'ry noon

Ponder deep wisdom , dark or clear
Each secret fishy hope or fear

Fish say , they have their Stream and Pond
But is there anything Beyond

This life can not be All , they swear
For how unpleasant , if it were

One may not doubt that , somehow , Good
Shall come of Water and of Mud

And , sure , the reverent eye must see
A Purpose in Liquidity

We darkly know , by Faith we cry
The future is not Wholly Dry

Mud unto mud ! -- Death eddies near
Not here the appointed End , not here

But somewhere , beyond Space and Time
Is wetter water , slimier slime

And there ( they trust ) there swimmeth One
Who swam ere rivers were begun

Immense , of fishy form and mind
Squamous , omnipotent , and kind

And under that Almighty Fin
The littlest fish may enter in

Oh ! never fly conceals a hook
Fish say , in the Eternal Brook

But more than mundane weeds are there
And mud , celestially fair

Fat caterpillars drift around
And Paradisal grubs are found

Unfading moths , immortal flies
And the worm that never dies

And in that Heaven of all their wish
There shall be no more land , say fish

For if the soul be not in place
What has laid trouble in her face

And , sits there nothing ware and wise
Behind the curtains of her eyes

And if the spirit be not there
Why is fragrance in the hair

`` Oh love is fair , and love is rare ; '' my dear one she said
`` But love goes lightly over . '' I bowed her foolish head

And kissed her hair and laughed at her . Such a child was she
So new to love , so true to love , and she spoke so bitterly

But there 's wisdom in women , of more than they have known
And thoughts go blowing through them , are wiser than their own

Or how should my dear one , being ignorant and young
Have cried on love so bitterly , with so true a tongue

So . . . the poor love of fools and blind I 've proved you
For , foul or lovely , 't was a fool that loved you

Softly along the dim way to your room
And found you sleeping in the quiet gloom

About my head , and held it . I had rest
Unhoped this side of Heaven , beneath your breast

So lightly I played with those dark memories
Just as a child , beneath the summer skies

Drift down the darkness . Plangent , hidden from eyes
Somewhere an ` eukaleli ' thrills and cries

And stabs with pain the night 's brown savagery
And dark scents whisper ; and dim waves creep to me

Gleam like a woman 's hair , stretch out , and rise
And new stars burn into the ancient skies

Whose perplexed heart did evil , foolishly
A long while since , and by some other sea

So a poor ghost , beside his misty streams
Is haunted by strange doubts , evasive dreams

We 'll beat on the substantial doors , nor tread
Those dusty high-roads of the aimless dead

Some low sweet alley between wind and wind
Stoop under faint gleams , thread the shadows , find

In noiseless tumult , break and wave and flow
Now tread the far South , or lift rounds of snow

Up to the white moon 's hidden loveliness
Some pause in their grave wandering comradeless

And turn with profound gesture vague and slow
As who would pray good for the world , but know

Out of the wash of days and temporal tide
Where Faith and Good , Wisdom and Truth abide

There stand the immortal ensigns of our war
Our melting flesh fixed Beauty there , a star

One after one , like tasting a sweet food
I have need to busy my heart with quietude

But darkens , and dies out from kiss to kiss
All this is love ; and all love is but this

That 's tossed down dusty pavements by the wind
Saying , `` She is most wise , patient and kind

So that I think all Heaven in flower to fold me
She 'll give me all I ask , kiss me and hold me

Three years , or a bit less
It was n't a success

By Tring and Lilley Hoo
As a free man may do

Forgotten at the last
Even Love goes past

And the brave sting of rain
I may not meet again

For none to mar or mend
That have themselves to friend

That soothes the darkening shires
And laughter , and inn-fires

And the dead leaves in the lane
Certainly , these remain

And lips as soft , but true
And I daresay she will do

Young Mary , loitering once her garden way
Felt a warm splendour grow in the April day

As wine that blushes water through . And soon
Out of the gold air of the afternoon

One knelt before her : hair he had , or fire
Bound back above his ears with golden wire

Baring the eager marble of his face
Not man 's nor woman 's was the immortal grace

Rounding the limbs beneath that robe of white
And lighting the proud eyes with changeless light

Incurious . Calm as his wings , and fair
That presence filled the garden . She stood there

Saying , `` What would you , Sir ? '' He told his word
`` Blessed art thou of women ! '' Half she heard

Hands folded and face bowed , half long had known
The message of that clear and holy tone

That fluttered hot sweet sobs about her heart
Such serene tidings moved such human smart

Her breath came quick as little flakes of snow
Her hands crept up her breast . She did but know

It was not hers . She felt a trembling stir
Within her body , a will too strong for her

That held and filled and mastered all . With eyes
Closed , and a thousand soft short broken sighs

She gave submission ; fearful , meek , and glad
She wished to speak . Under her breasts she had

Such multitudinous burnings , to and fro
And throbs not understood ; she did not know

If they were hurt or joy for her ; but only
That she was grown strange to herself , half lonely

All wonderful , filled full of pains to come
And thoughts she dare not think , swift thoughts and dumb

Human , and quaint , her own , yet very far
Divine , dear , terrible , familiar

Her heart was faint for telling ; to relate
Her limbs ' sweet treachery , her strange high estate

Over and over , whispering , half revealing
Weeping ; and so find kindness to her healing

'Twixt tears and laughter , panic hurrying her
She raised her eyes to that fair messenger

He knelt unmoved , immortal ; with his eyes
Gazing beyond her , calm to the calm skies

Radiant , untroubled in his wisdom , kind
His sheaf of lilies stirred not in the wind

How should she , pitiful with mortality
Try the wide peace of that felicity

With ripples of her perplexed shaken heart
And hints of human ecstasy , human smart

And whispers of the lonely weight she bore
And how her womb within was hers no more

And at length hers ? Being tired , she bowed her head
And said , `` So be it ! '' The great wings were spread

Showering glory on the fields , and fire
The whole air , singing , bore him up , and higher

Unswerving , unreluctant . Soon he shone
A gold speck in the gold skies ; then was gone

The day that YOUTH had died
There came to his grave-side

In decent mourning , from the country 's ends
Those scatter 'd friends

No quest of his unsharÃ•d
All these , with loitering feet and sad head barÃ•d

Folly went first
With muffled bells and coxcomb still reversÃ•d

And after trod the bearers , hat in handÃ‘
Laughter , most hoarse , and Captain Pride with tanned

And martial face all grim , and fussy Joy
Who had to catch a train , and Lust , poor , snivelling boy

These bore the dear departed
Behind them , broken-hearted

Came Grief , so noisy a widow , that all said
Ã’Had he but wed

And by her , trying to soothe her all the time
The fatherless children , Colour , Tune , and Rhyme

( The sweet lad Rhyme ) , ran all-uncomprehending
Then , at the wayÃ•s sad ending

Round the raw grave they stayÃ•d . Old Wisdom read
In mumbling tone , the Service for the Dead

Impatience , ever taking out his watch
Faith , who was deaf , and had to lean , to catch

Yes , with much woe and mourning general
At dead YouthÃ•s funeral

Who erst the fair and living Youth did know
All , except only Love . Love had died long ago

JUST now the lilac is in bloom
All before my little room

And in my flower-beds , I think
Smile the carnation and the pink

And down the borders , well I know
The poppy and the pansy blow

Oh ! there the chestnuts , summer through
Beside the river make for you

A tunnel of green gloom , and sleep
Deeply above ; and green and deep

The stream mysterious glides beneath
Green as a dream and deep as death

Ã‘Oh , damn ! I know it ! and I know
How the May fields all golden show

A little while, and then to sleep!
He had but a short night to live
When he awoke, and found a sheep
In a white bush, by a black beehive!

The good and all the virtuous dead
Their lives and spirits shall be dead
Tho ' men will pity and tread
With gladness in their last shed!

The duchess of Pembroke 's land:
Then from the table rose a guest,
To whom began the tale of hand,
And with a silver knife he rest?

Fain would the heart of him awake
To hear what other woe and pain
Would cause him in the path to wake
If not before his friend and gain.

O little ones, how sweet to see
Their little footsteps in the grass
Blithely tread, and lightly timidly
Through the sweet open air to jas!

And, if they wish him to escape
He will shoot with his quiver too.
As from an open door the ape
Might seem bewildered, so the coo!

But, where all other birds are mute,
Here only, only are we birds.
You have not noticed yet his offshoot
Of human grace, that turns to leopards?

From my heart, no need I bring thee here.
O thou, in whose pure presence none
For me may sorrow for thy bier;
My tears as when the winter rollen?

Where, on the plain in open space
From the high wall 's base to the ground,
The monarch sees his country base
Or in a foreign province bound?

Thou, who dost see through all the night
The stars of dawn and evening
Turn to the northward, to the midnight
Who to and fro at interceding?

He had the honour of his place
The honour of the city 's pride.
His mother 's hand to guard and mace
With him did guide her daughter pryde.

If toil and woe may prove your fate,
The boon of youth must now be ours.
So through that field his horse he trait,
Like lightning in the air he showers!

He took his place beside the throne.
Then the lady paused awhile,
And then, and then, she turned and thoen
She looked from him without a guile.

When I was on the earth, ye men
Whom men of earth have left behind
The rest you never will kenn,
And the men in them who bear unkind.

The King of England saw the light.
He saw the King of England turn
To all the nations round: and whyte
In one dread moment was he sterne?

I heard a sound, my heart beat loud
Oh come away, my dear, and rest
Beneath those dewy, sunlit ploughed
And when I woke again, no quest!

A man that will, I own, may go
Like other men to some great work,
And he may not for ever rollo
So far as my poor mind would lurk?

If they can not do our errand,
Then at least their work be not ended.
Thus the father answered: Yea, lengthened,
They have accomplished our expected.

And with loud roar and clanging lash
Forth went the foe with joy the while
And his red face grew redder moustache
As now the sword in hand did beguile.

If the world should ever love thee more;
If the world love thee less, and with less
Would have it more, less would it store:
If the world love thee less, and with bless?

And 'n ' the next night she told me
' I never came to be married,
And then she bade me take a pea
With the sweet maidens of the ganymede.

For that your heart has gone astray.
Away, away! but nevermore
I saw, nor saw again my say.
The day that brought you here would for?

For those sweet, sweet songs and that good
Dante tells not, but that we were wise.
Tonight, my heart and soul are stood!
You may be glad, but I 'm unwise!

And in the nighttime by the sea
Is the lonely forest lying,
And the sun that shines out on coterie
Is no longer golden peering!

Thy spirit, through my soul shall rest:
And this, my heart, so pure and fair
Upon thy bosom I might jest
Would only make me doubly there.

So let us live forevermore.
Oh, for the joy that dost abound,
The happy, happy, sweet lor
Of such a home and country merrygoround!

With thee of old, as all my children
Are with agemen on the earth
In love with thee is mine I love schoolchildren,
In love with thee is mine I love wurth?

It was not mine to tell the tale;
My tale was told, but not alone
With love, with passion sweet, with wail.
It is not mine my heart to sown!

And yet he does not have you yet.
He will never be happy once
He will never get to be jet;
What can he have by force or eloquence?

And then by fits the little boat
Maidens will be gone forever.
All the joys that were mine have oat
Growed and have ever waned sober.

And one of them in all might be
My father, when you saw him fall,
If not be mine, the poor boy si.
No, though you tell me of the krall!

From the very first morning 's bright blue.
Oh, the white and golden gleaming
Of the lilies, and the horseshoe
And the gold of the purple prattling?

And still the sea 's deep moat was cold
And still, as now, the sea was calm
As though the ocean waters hold
A frozen bridge of silence som.

Of beauty 's light, which, from the depth
Of earth 's eternal solitude,
Has made another 's life infidel.
If such as we and those who delude!

And all the world like darkness lies
Round his heart, it is not he. Thou
That wishest with the world 's whole eyes'
From sight to shadow, but can now.

And as we go our merry way,
A little while we stand forlorn;
And we know what is best at day,
And as we go we 'll walk bourne.

He spoke no word, and, while he spoke
His face rose up, and all he thought
Was what he saw was how he woke.
He caught his hand, she turned, she sought.

So may your song immortal bloom,
Nor falter, vainly sing my song,
That, when my soul shall wake heirloom,
May be the only one to throng.

By the black sea, by the grey shore
Where the water glimmers with gold!
The white moon is low in the corr,
And the stars are silent and tolled?

Till, 'midst the gloom, a solemn light
Fell on the air, like that faint beam
From some eternal shrine, that whyte
That faroff, lost moonbeam.

This I have learned: that thy right hand
To earth can bend the law, and guide
That holy office, which shall grande
The final law for wide.

This, who, when I came, was nigh me
So near and so near that the voice
Of one beside me, like a beauty,
Said, Tell it not, my child, or rejoice.

From the great ocean of the West,
From the great Pacific Ocean!
It is not thy father, the selfprofessed
The sea of darkness and dungeon!

And some in tears and some in fears.
'T was midnight when the daystar shone
And all men woke and heard the spheres.
'T was noon when all in all they sown!

What if an eye not known to me
Should catch within it a strange gleam
Of light that shone at once seemingly
A sight from some deeppiping dream?

But the red rose of truth was sweet.
And the flowers of light that fell
On the boughs of my love and feet
Were sweeter than words could harpel.

The morn has laid his sunblazed brow,
And to the winds the starless air,
The days of woe had fled, and blau,
And now the wintry wold lay ne'er?

Then he said, ' A word unto Jove
Whose heart is fire as ever was
Whose tongue shall be a trumpet goe,
And the wordbreathing thunder, maz!

He sees his mother 's tears, and sees
What tears are shed the father 's face.
It is not time to sleep, she sally's
When the last moon is out and space.

The sun, the night, the spring, and all
That 's left of God I love to see.
My Lord is not my slave; I prall
His only will in me justly.

A mighty storm and thunder fell,
Down on the earth the clouds of hell
As through the cloudless night they marvell.
Thence to the river bank, there retell!

They never shall see me again.
I only knew a little while
And that he 'd always be my when.
His face is like the morning lile.

And never can remember how
She met my cheek again in school,
The morning glow or the bough
Which brings me down into my cool!

To hear the olden songs anew,
To make the garden sweet again.
The trees with boughes and shoots are ewe
With all its little green jenn.

But a hundred hearts, and a hundred souls,
And a hundred tongues, and a hundred tongues
And a hundred faces with a dim coals;
And the very word that he sung's?

And still the light and sound of feet
Were all around; and round in vain
The restless, restless shadows meet
Like stars upon all earth and plain?

A gentle soul, or gentle mind
Or that of one who should be loved
What is love, then? To him and unconfined
I give your life and soul, and unloved!

To all her friends, and from their looks
A blessing brought that was to end;
But he a second word had brooks'
Which made his heart rejoice all tend!

To her whose love hath filled my heart,
Whose heart may never weary be.
Hark, hark away and let me part
Hark back to that soft voice serenely?

The good, the noble, shall be mine.
Not on the spot of strife I stay
Nor to avenge a wrong columbine,
I honour, on my friend the mey.

No such the same, for they are more
Saw but the sky, than his, which he
The clouds in clouds may be and forr.
But he, by whom the other kingly?

For love of me is so, 't is so
That from that day they both did kiss.
And when my lips and eyes were stanko
That I was gone, their looks I diaphanous?

There 's a man up on the hill,
There 's a man down on the lea,
And we will keep his cattle nil,
That the winter will end. ï¿½xiv. henney.

By the sound of a song of birds.
But you, by the sound of the wind
Would swear from the shore you were shepherds
If we were as you used to bind.

So in the world of love they 've met.
The wind that blew across the sea
Took the wild sea 's green waves wet.
Their hands and hearts together easterly.

I 'd tell thee the truth, as it should be.
What the meaning of thy speech is.
What they mean it seems it ca n't larceny.
He is quite right; but I dashes.

Then spake the valiant Siegelind,
And thus to Hagan thus replied
This may not harm thy moccasin,
For thy life I trust, for my fratricide?

'T was there they learned the way to live,
They had to learn the secret too
The ways of men like these they strive,
Of that they told the truth to.

By whose high will I dare not dare
Carry me to this bitter shore.
The wind has left their bark they're,
They fear no farther, but keep onshore.

And you are the true heart and the true head
Of my people. Now all is peace,
And to the very last I 'll behead
The song of one whose heart it caprice.

He wals but with words of anger
His anger may be appeased. â
The good Vibhishaá¹ then haser
To question thus the hero â s gath?

But I do n't say it was a thing
To think for what you might have thought
After what 's past I do n't inquiring
I 'd be in the middle of sot?

His heart 's desire the soul possessed.
Whence came you, that, when you saw it,
Into one common face transgressed,
With eyes that burned in beauty 's whit?

For my heart is set on going there;
For the sweet hours are fast and flown
Ah you are very dear, my comair,
To my heart you are dearly own!

A lady, with a silver ring
Who loved him long and love to love.
And all the day they sat and winking
Till in its depths a moonlight of.

And now thy spirit in the air
Can breathe of gladness, sweet release,
And when the summer 's sunshine err
'And winter comes in beauty surcease?

Hers a man is I! a man like
My kind, sincere, devoted friend!
His kind, sincere, devoted childlike!
He lives in the hills in the bend?

For one in truth, or one to meet.
No other than a spirit 's light
May make his place within him fleet,
And bring him, from the grave of acolyte?

And I, that am his friend and guide,
Curl up the sword and bid him slay.
But I am old in faith and pride,
As in the days of old yea!

This was the hour the hero, born
Thus with his arm in air his feet
Bore to the foe the dreadful forsworn;
And ere his arm the warrior greet?

What is my lot? And if one day,
A little moment more, I may
Pardon you to this wrong I slay,
Which you have done me, and my soiree?

So is his name the prize of kings
To all who wait on him to pass
But he is never found cravings.
His name is death, because I overpass!

The time is short for giving thought
To words and deeds of art and song!
I stand in my study with naught
With my glass and book and pen throng!

To bring him nearer to his doom:
He said, My brother! he replied,
I see him on the loom,
Yet not I see a single pride?

And the first of the good to be
That will be remembered by me.
What do you think of the loblolly
That lived in the little frosty?

And I, the master by my feet
Will be the keeper of the keys;
I shall, of all and all I st,
My lady be the only riese.

And I am old. Let others be!
My dear, my dear, my friend 's a poet:
He never would do well to sternly
His master at his first dulcet?

And, all the years, she 's very dear.
The sun is shining through the trees
The snow that falls is falling fier;
And so it is I take my sneeze.

Myself in silence sit alone,
Watching for him that looks before.
For him and those who go atone
The son of Mars with face to explore.

The golden bow and shining mail,
Thro ' whose bright eyes the God of war
Laid down his hand and smote travail
The waraxe with its dreadful sizemore.

The land with her sweet bosom swelled
And the great sun was in his prime.
'Mid the great days for which I marvelled
Was the dear home and mother time!

To the white cliffs of Seville.
He looked at her as she bade him.
He had grown accustomed to swill,
And his voice had grown exim.

The little white cat from the house.
Little red cat, you are sleeping.
Little red cat, you are rouse.
Little red cat, in bed rest rippling.

And, like those stars that haunt us yet
Which through the darkling night of May
With dim and sudden lights unmet,
Like stars that through a summer dray?

The little boy sat there and laughed,
Wept like the little boy at night;
And he began to wail and aft,
Wept like the little boy at hight.

My dear mother? What have you done
For this old friend I found who gave
A little dog and a zircon?
I 'd go and get that old friend they've.

And, seeing her fair, as in the sky
With happy hopes they blushed, and quenched
The heat, and to the wood they lye.
The winds were on a thousand rushes!

'My mother was no wife, I know
But lived a lonely life through
She took a dainty lad to papo,
Though now upon their su!

When you 're with that girl in the room.
And yet I never shall forget,
When in the hall the baby kaboom,
She laughed and cried aloud in set.

But oh, they were not in my mind
And there they are no more my soul!
My lips must be their last entwined!
And oh, the thought of him they stole!

All you men that go to the fight
All you men that live long and brave
All you men that are brave in bright
Livin ' 'neath our flag 'neath the lave?

Or a little pail of water.
Then the ancient Wainamoinen
To his daughter made answer pryor:
O my sweetheart, wilt thou give hanssen.

I can not, by command of Jove,
Destroy Thy glory in thine eyes.
LXXX. ' I have the keys! in all our quattro
Have I the power to command?

That made the world to live anew
A thousand happy years and more
A thousand weary days and do,
And there is not a day so ador.

In the dim sky a wind may blow,
But the sun can not see me well.
Come, and a day will soon disbro
Where the moon 's light gleams in the nouvelle.

Who all those things may prove, and show
In each our present to his mind. â
Then spoke RÃ¡ma: â If thou will not soco
From truth, and reason, thou shalt mist.

O'er the bright seawashed shore o
An opening isle is seen
O'er the sweet green hills of io,
And along the watery kerosene!

And I can find me here, you see.
This is the place you wished to go,
Or what is it you loved so softly?
If I see the green earth round zero?

But thou, where'er I linger
I see thee soon returning, too. ï¿½ vol
In yonder river, my home, misnomer
Behold thy lovely tadpoles.

And on it hangs all those great suns:
Yet, lo, there shines beyond the skies
The glory of seaman's
It makes my spirit laugh and dramatize.

And so it 's just about to start.
And if you do n't like to hear it
We 'll come out here in a braveheart
And play the lark until he 's emasculate?

I saw him, and he smiled on me,
And I left my life, I love him
And I died my life, I love carelessly.
Away, away, the snow lies rim?

'T was here that first my faith was known
When first to God my faith was known.
In Heaven the sacred name was grown,
And evermore my thoughts were sown?

To you I come! said the Fairy.
I, to be sure, was the right word
But alas, I wish some pre
He looked at some others and smothered.

And still as in their graves lay dying.
And one at distance with a lisp.
In another her brows had lapp snuffing.
She turned her face, I do not wisp!

And his mother was still his bride
Then I turned away from the house,
And a year went before his preside
And a year went behind his mouse.

The wretch, who so defraud 'd his lord
With all his gold, must pay the price?
The monarch spake, and thus with gourd
Approval from his lips resum nyce!

The young ones in their childhood 's days,
The old, the cheerful and the brave
The young, the cheerful and the blaise
A little group of merry knave?

By a deepseadwelling island
Taken in a tempestuous boat,
Where the snow falls from its cordoned,
Where the seanymphs go remote.

And by the door I saw him pass.
When to the door I stood I saw
Two figures laughing laughing ass,
Tenderly looking each to maw.

From its dim window in the gloom.
Ah! where the pale gold sunlight beams?
Ah! where the darkgreen lilies fume
And fall to fill the narrow streams?

I see the young, the old, the fair
The smiling as their youth depart
But who can tell the change of hair
In childhood 's cheek can never smartt!

We come to learn, when you be dead
How hard it is to love alone,
Nor will the world despise us lead.
We come to tell, when you are lone!

A childless woman, pale and dim
A white cloud the moonlight covers
A mist, in the mist that hymn.
Lemminkainen 's mother looks sapphires!

Her body 's lightness, or her charms?
'T is thus the wise should gaze the rest
How they should wish their love and arms!
O mother, let me not detest!

Thro ' the lilies that grew on the
Odyssean banks there was a voice
I knew from the distant migra
I sang a song as if it rejoice!

This moment on that stage I stand
Tremendoussized and barehanded
Not more tall than the tallest righthand
Who ever was seen in a coldblooded.

With what a sight would the world o
Might admire their gaily green hair.
How proud they are! 't is but to scarecrow
A stranger to that country hare.

And he could laugh on his wings
Ah, he could dance on his breast,
And he could lie on his stockings
God could give these little rest?

With thy bright lightnings! when the sun
Shall set upon thy brow thy hair?
If he shall frown the day shall aspen,
And the moon sink into the hare.

There on my bed the moonlight falls
I have a ring upon my head;
I take it from the sleeper all's,
In a ring on my godhead.

The morn had long been dreary there
And now the skies were full of mirth.
The moon had passed away ayre
The cloudless sky: the night had birth?

And you would know who stole from
Shepherd the sheep he was praying.
He had a sheep in his anachronism,
And he had a sheep in his wing!

The daintiest dreams have come to me
Of the days that were ere we came
But still I know I am but weedy
And have not seen the skies inflame.

With a sudden gush of surprise
Out of his pocket at the sight.
So he put his hands on his rise,
And began to ruffle quite?

Of its deep wells, and its bright streams;
Its pleasant vallies, and its glade
For meadows of the summer moonbeams
For meadows of the fallow bade!

That from the heart she has never
To leave without the breath she took
I feel a sense of sadness auger,
And what she looks upon me look.

On every part of the earth
Whose spirit, as with stars, is there
To dwell in the eternal perth.
And, while my life is waiting ne'er!

And all your joys had fled away.
But you 'll stay here at my window,
Where a star shines through the wy.
And when I open my fallow.

All in the same day and same night!
The King of Kings comes back for us,
To make us all come back to skylight
We do not wonder what he delirious!

Where I should find my body so?
Why should I come with nothing more?
Then, for my soul alone I grow
I would not feel the breath of heretofore.

Now have I turned from this old land,
In every land of pleasure
I am the master of my fatherland.
Oh! there are songs for all the waver.

I 'm going to have a look at it,
And you know that it 's very hard.
In the very midst of the sunlit
The little Ann, as you may card.

He is a king and I a queen;
But what I have is but a name,
But a name on my lips I peregrine.
He was a man, but I a flame?

That is and is and is not so.
Him I shall choose as he best can,
And I shall never, never como
The honour I deserve to tan.

As when the dawning sun doth break
On the lone plains a cloud, and all
The fields are open wide ache.
And when the day comes back wherewithal?

The young, the fair, the bold who sought
To save their country, or to live
On the ground till they were at naught
Nor less at home when home would strive.

For you have heard the tales I tell.
Here on the mountain 's back they hang
A wailing cry of anguish stell
And, as they fly and groan in harangue.

Haste to your work when you have need.
For what is man the soul of man
Who dares not fear the hand of steed?
Haste, go, and let thy spirit manne?

Her lips with aching lips were red,
And with her arms she lean 'd her head
Down to the bed her lover said,
While round her lover 's neck she cling instead?

In these is now a joy more bright.
I will go as far in spirit
As I have come, but what I forthright
Is that my path is narrow confederate?

So that as he his life doth gain
Unto him more honour, more ease
He hath his portion, than his grain.
Such is the will of justice frees.

Of her whom thou hast heard thysel
For aye, I will prove ye to be
Thyself the best of all my s
And if I may not win mysel chappie!

He may the same be ours, but thou
Wilt not be my husband; nor I
And never ever shall he endow.
Then with a mighty shout the sy.

How my heart throbs with happiness
How a mother 's breast beats with love;
How my dear life lives with its capricious,
And the joys I will not above.

His eyes a cloudless splendour shed
And a sound of murmurs blent so
His breath to her was like a sped.
She felt the love she breathed for mucho.

Obey the old, old God, whose decree
I never yet can understand.
And one small thought that lingers knotty
My boy shall never touch the strand?

Till I feel there 's more than love
At my heart like the sea. and, dear
I have no other lips but of,
What shall I do but love your spear?

And the other one by the side
Who with a sudden start perceives
With astonishment at her vied;
Yet more amazement the sheaves.

So often as she smiled he did,
Such fond caresses seem 'd to flow.
She 'd talk 'd him up a word to fretted
The pomp and pride of him whose pino!

He knows a mighty man. Not long
With one great man his life has pass d
And none now is as strong as furlong.
And all must change their fortunes, marty!

There is but one who understands.
'Neath the cold snow of the winter
My soul is a cloud of quicksands.
I can not sleep for a bower.

That this fair bride shall take my hand
And kiss it, and in the morning
Let others tell of happy land.
And from my window will I waltzing!

And her soul and my heart are two,
I, who may never love nor trust;
Nor ever, like myself, emu
That I should ever love angriest.

The winds with silver thunders ring
There shall there all the woods with gold
Be piled, there on the hills with sprouting;
And in the woods, on ev'ry marigold!

And when the first, the last and last
In the wide earth came forth from her
In that most tender and most classed
And when with her sweet voice a fiddler.

No. When that great and wise Queen that
Was all within the forest, saw
Thy face, she spake to him and flat:
'My heart, I will come to thee, O mothersinlaw.

In sorrow or joy or despair.
I have known such a child, my Love!
Yet when the dawning of the rare
And in the fragrant glen of foxglove?

But what are we to you and I?
We must see the heavens in vain
The stars they are but little wry.
The stars they are but little grain.

Nor in the depth of the seacaves
To his ship 's prow is ever heard
And that in the deep he may raves,
And toil and trouble, and devoured!

A single foot and then the rest
But he was weary, and with dread
The mighty weight upon his breast.
But now, he said, if you 'll but wed.

Who lives that day to greet the dawn?
The light shines clear before the way,
And never more the daylight quan
Though all the world beside is day.

A voice in all her halls proclaim d
And soon the sinner 's head she saw.
Oft did the priest with piteous meekly
Shed his warm teardrops on his haugh?

As the snowflakes of a year 's noon
That come and go beneath the sky
And all around the earth doth croon
All things that the world 's heart can die.

Which no man hath found in these books
On what this world was, but a book
That no man has read in, but brooks
The very world his own took.

Now from our hearts, and from our heads;
We are the angels, that have sent
The souls to God, and those to homesteads,
And we have chosen for the event.

And the blueeyed ones looked aghast
At her little head with a sigh,
And her little hand was downcast,
And her eye looked as if it eye!

And when again his feet are made,
With such fresh beauty as his heart
In his own bosom doth unafraid
And that alone is best impart!

My body here and there is sore.
My soul is in all doubt and gloom,
My body well I doubt and corr
But oft I think and reassume?

If he were dead with all his race.
When I heard this all unspoken
I would have fled the forest chase
To find a spot where none were anyone?

I am my mother. What is that
You see for me within a hut
Close by an alien country stat?
We are not friends. I was your planet?

That no one ever heard again,
When the great Master of the North
In one great work in earth and ten
Wore away the world for thenceforth!

His sister, who in all her charms
Besprays the God of Love, that she
Shall wear him with a garland arms
And these shall deck him with a marquis!

Saw that fair bride, when with delight
Into the bosom of the dew
He gently touched the virgin sprite.
'Maiden beautiful, 't is my do?

With all the splendour of the sun,
We see the livid white and gray,
The sea, the sky, the stars, we fatten,
Like ghosts of those who, on their castaway?

For, if she be not to be told,
Her very heart will break for you.
Not so to me the maid will hold
Who, all in all her life, had outgrew!

From this, from that, to come in haste
To make our present place a home.
He wouldst not yet have seen the waste,
While we were sitting silent gloam.

Where all the earth, and all its stars
Are gathered by the sound of feet.
For the soul which is not of ares
To her pure souls is welcome treat.

The sun and the waves of the sea
Are shining on a ship so fair
But I am sick of her cruelty.
She is not my home but an err!

That man might go, I fear, and live!
But ere thou had'st come to my side,
And when he passed my beehive,
I know he 'd been a friend to hide?

For I have not a heart today!
For we must go tonight, and wait
For your return in peace and ente?
She bowed her head, her eyes grew sate.

With such a passion, full of joy
I clasped thine arm; in silence said:
ï¿½I would that thou hadst come with joye
To win, to break with joy, the godhead.

To hear a lady 's voice today?
Or, in the stillness of thy dream
Tell of one fair and ditt'rous tre!
Tomorrow, when thy sun has teem?

Fills with a thousand sighs his ear,
And bids him haste away to rest.
I know, said he, that if I hear,
'T is only I myself can best?

No more than I have said before;
But here, as is the wonted plan,
We may, as we have said, troubadour.
Now on the road, now nearer, gan.

What will they be? what shall they be?
In what condition? from what heart
Shall they escape this awful yeti?
All save those whom they can sweetheart?

Breathing from her heart a bitter
Whining, as she fled before him
Breathing from her heart a sweeter:
'Bring a hat for me to see im?

Till a mighty streamlet of pearl
From the bosom of a crystal
Leaves the crystal streamlets pearle
Leaves the crystal streamlets fickle.

So you can trust her now you know.
And while you have some other care
And you must do as you were fro.
I hope your heart may see my snare?

A light that all the angels see,
And love that all may love in us
So that the child shall know his booty.
O light that all your light can truss!

Aye, and the world is ours to see.
Here is a way to the North Pole
Where the ice holds me and my granny,
And the frozen seaweed covers dole.

Yet, since the years are coming, to
Avenge my husband 's crime and ill
I should not longer mourn him liu.
There let the tears, and sighs, and fil?

The day it comes will be a dream
Like the sunrise the soul hath dreamed,
When from these skies it rose seraphim!
In these old days the man that beamed?

No place was left for her to sit,
Her heart was free and she could speak.
But they were there, the gentle pritt
Had sent them down the path and shriek.

With eyes that watched the sun, the night
Ran slowly, and the day had gone.
'T was winter, when the spring was skylight,
The birds went out the street in shawn?

'Mong the hills and valleys we sing,
We are the only ones on earth
Who would not part the world adhering.
We bring you tales of pain and worth?

He left you, with a solemn sigh
And left you smiling in the sun.
The old man gazed and smiled, the nigh
As on the sand his feet lay bodden!

From the great, and so had brought it
From the deep, with a heavy stride:
So on he rode, and onward plaudit;
And in the dark of night he chide?

And there a young man, like a lamb
Curls up and pats it upon the knee.
The whole world is a little cram
I am all it can get for germany.

And never a word shall utter.
Then all the men of Sariola
Cried loudly and to each martyr
Come, thou little people, we carranza.

But for thy sake I will not care;
Yet for thyself I will be strong
And in a moment shall blare.
When will I choose the hour of diphthong?

When he saw the men of the town
Singing, the same old song they did,
While it was still a happy crown
That they had set there in their gilded.

The sweet and dusky leaves have flown,
The leaves have fled, I only know
The sun is low, and it hath thrown
I only feel the wind of pico.

When, one and all, to make it go
Beside the road, I 'd be a beast.
That was a great time ago, says calico,
When the stockbroker was a priest.

Wherein the sun of God on high
Was manifest before the crowd.
And over the wide land I pry
Wherever the great Prophet ploughed!

Then as they rose, a sudden sound
Of footsteps, all unheard, escaped
Before the dreadful scene they bound.
I heard a voice within my scraped!

But, oh! how much the heart of man
Is troubled, tho ' to some unknown goal
He feels the weight of care, than!
The loss of what was once his foal!

On one another, but on one
A kind of heart, a passion kind
And each to one they came and loken.
In years to come the oldtime rewind!

But he was sure to be a fool
There was n't any chance he 'd run the race,
He 'd go the way he ought to spool.
He fell short the next day, the place.

'T is no place to sit up late. A
thousandth part of the year is all
And so it is with such a spatula,
That all the world is glad to thrall!

To their own joy and happiness,
The joys of youth, the happy hours
The times that come when Nature lustrous
In order grand and holy grasshoppers.

I can not be what I have been.
I am that which the wind can hear.
I am the bird that sings forin
I am the sun that glows here.

For love and love, he said, my heart
Will hold to such a faith and trust.
Behold, said I, thy words shall dart
Yet thou must follow me, and mightiest!

All thy friends are as good as thine,
And thine to each be all thy care.
Oh, thou poor one, from out thy porcupine!
Who, from tomorrow 's grave corriere.

With love is there ever any grace
That might have given an earthly
To the light that is but efface.
For if the heart of one have loved ivy!

The sweetest words they ever spoke!
They would have heard the music 's fall
Have drunk the sweetest cup the folk.
They would have heard the sweetest pitfall!

No more, save her, as thou shalt. Let
That be the end of it; nor know
How, by the will alone, that mette
Might take her spirit to this sbarro.

And now she stood, with cheeks as sweet
As when her father left them dead.
Her soul was tender, still, and teet,
Her head she wore as modest fed.

By the river, with its current
Which led to the woodlands hollow,
And a path of snow above accompaniment,
And a hillside with its pro!

And thou shall know that by the same
All nature must be reconciled
When from the worldspat body became.
So when their brother 's bosom beguiled!

From their native seas, the nymphs of
Eveï¿½th, to those hermits, and to
Hermits and sages, and to the foxglove.
So they, with eager pace, the cuckoo!

I wot thou hast forgotten this
Whilst all the world was filled with pride
Of its new conquest, and of pris
Of the new thing it was to yuletide.

The first the queen of heaven gave
When all the earth, in her delight
Was filled with wonder and save.
â How may the maidenborn alight!

And with his spear he drew again,
And with his shield renewed the force.
Forthwith the shield he struck brenn
And in his shoulder thrust the corse.

And so I sit, and hear the wind
That beats the grass and stirs the trees;
And on my ear a thousand twined
Of laughter break the silence dormitories.

So did he speak, and they did speak,
And the wind still whistled through the trees
And all the woodlands seemed to shriek,
So I heard then an owl, an internees!

Which is to say, he will have time
For a jolly bout of 't is own
With whom we can talk of a rhyme
As a very little roan.

I saw the young ones dance and sing
In front of the old man 's old hat;
My little Mary would stand reeking
And bless her little hands for that!

And then no matter if it were true
She 'd call her boys and daughters good
And always look down at her snowshoe.
She seemed to tell them who she stood.

All those that do with them today
The way I took them, I have lost
Yet shall their story tell me tre
Than I have loved before and crisscrossed.

And now the time is not to fall;
And today my dear love is dead;
And I shall give my love my tol.
I am a very sweet young hollyhead?

The sunless face he had forgot,
The face that still remained when day
The little thing he had cannot.
The face that his mother had spray.

In every sense are hidden.
Here, here our lives are all unmingled
There we make new friends and darken
Here we learn from all our peopled!

The man of a heart so young and true.
But who are they on earth to make
A foolish faith at to,
For you must trust them all and forsake?

And still we can not hear or see
The music that comes nearer now
Than what they sang of one long donnie.
Yet the birds in the garden thou!

For that is nothing but an art,
Who would to make the sky his own;
And thus'mongst men a common part
Soothes the ground with art 's best flown.

Till the world 's a jagged sheet of mud
And the black sky above it creeps,
Like a big, black cloud into blood,
Then they drop out like maws to weeps.

There was none of us, said our guide
When we returned to our abode
At the first morning of the bide.
And when our weary limbs were furrowed.

With the breath of the evening.
In the distance the great forest
Falls down, and the winds blow somersaulting.
Facing to the sea a wisest.

And the whole world would turn with joy.
I dreamed that in this place of crime
And sin and sorrow I had floy
From the Lord 's love, and it is springtime.

On life 's uncertain journey
Gives the hope of that glorious day,
For all the people love him huddy!
Laid by the waters far fay!

And all about the castle 's fair
The fairies flit and pass with ease
And often at the gate or stair
Their golden eyes are bent and draperies.

'T is the hour of day, and the dawn
Hath struck the mountain peak, and I
A little distance look foregone,
And, gazing on it, see that cry?

But when the dawning dawn of day
The morning star began to shed
The rosy gleam that told the fe
The clouds were rolling by its thread.

With my own soul outstrewed, and found
That its whole spirit did not fail.
With that, the first thing in my sound
Was not a word alone, I vail.

Than other men are, as they will
From what they stand without, a foe!
What of the man who is his trill?
In fact, the best of men are longfellow?

For you know how her parents say.
I wonder what 's the secret there?
I wonder what her father re
And how the boy that 's gone mair.

Or the great blue flag that hung above.
But with his hand a golden ring
Made out of silver, on his glove,
Whereon was hung a crown of beleaguering.

The sun sets high and spreads his ray;
The storm that winds behind him flies,
He comes across the seas of usa,
And brings a brighter ray to sighs.

Today I 'm the chief and dearest!
I 'll teach you how to kiss your lips!
Passion, and you 'll look more wisest;
If you 're the youngest, kiss me pips!

He would not give her back again.
She would not know; he would not see
He would not hear; he would not zen
He would not keep the old life prophecy?

Her hand he shook, and to her cried:
Behold her face is weeping cold
Though in her arms her trembling chide
Has given itself up to fold?

That to the living doth descend
That in his mighty spirit dwell
That by the living 's heart he rende
The living, that by life is kjell.

â Her lips in such a silence fell:
â My tongue my lips to let loose lay
â I would no better were the nel.
â No more I â ve ever thus my sinay!

And to him, if he can hear them,
Let us give them the same answer;
From the rock the oak will bring hem
And the fir will bring from streamer?

And when she saw the great white ship
It galled her, and she knew it too
But the sun there shone still a klipp
To hide her eyes and make her two.

Who to his will no gifts have brought
Save death and deathless honours vain.
How should we think? if all would thought
To hear their father 's word no stain.

The little child I left behind.
For that sweet little boy that grew
To be a hero of my mind,
The little boy I left do!

All her charms have vanished; her heart
Is sad, yet with her beauty dies.
She hath no music of the art;
Her hands are laid upon the skies?

As she was walking down the aisle,
That, looking at her brother, thought
She 'd rather be alone with reptile.
But not so very often naught.

Her beauty that was all her own
The love that is her only own.
Yet she is fairest with her zone
That ever wept when fair she goan.

By some of those who live by day
And to some of these are less wise.
There are who hold in awe the play
About the love of men we securitize!

The rest to be no further seen,
But one by one the world is won
Our fate is as the great Good green
For evermore and impregnation.

Myself, with nothing else to do,
Had not my soul this task to know.
And, as I journey 'd, so I rew
As soon as on the way I quo!

And I 'll call the lady as well,
And all the knights in white and red:
It 's a merry day; my bonnie trowel,
Its wings are full with fire and lead?

Thy name shall be the mark of all
Thy fame, and there, by all of fame,
I see thy spirit wherewithal;
And, when my soul to life can claim!

I see a star within the mist
The moonlit distance bends her down.
I see the moon with all her whitest,
She lies upon the beach of brown.

And I loved him as I loved you.
But there he lies like an acorn
In the valley, where the winds mew.
And the lily in the morn!

And yet I know not; so my tale,
When, loath to say it, I begun
To know it in my own frail,
Saw there a man without hooligan?

Thy will is not to doubt, I swear,
'T is but for the sake of one true heart,
Sealed and sealed, one pure soul. Let heir
All glory be for ever impart.

A child that sleeps with grief in bed,
And never looks on face nor tone
But laughs out bitter love in shedd.
When I was born I knew the anemone!

Her hand the little children fill d
And with soft looks their lips did try
Her fingers twined her silken fudgy
And made a silken garland by!

When you 've gone down the winding ways
In those wild days of pain and gloom.
When you 've passed the lonely doorways
By paths of sorrow and perfume?

So much, to make his friends rejoice.
He, with his face upraised, in air
Stript on the dust the visor choice,
And looked with deep resentment ne'er.

No! ye who would the good Lord have
To give your faith and love to me?
I saw some maid in fair halve
With sparkling hair, her hair all marchi?

That is the sign of our coming
And the music of our coming.
And what 's that? O brother, kindling,
What 's that? cries Kyllikki, tainting.

Himself a fiercer flame shall burn.
Such words his father â s bosom swell
He turns to tears that rise in spurn:
â I see the flames are blotted l.

What ails her, if in this sad land
I should live? The woman in me
Is like a God that can not brand
The joy or sorrow that she dreadfully.

Now the wail on her heart is full
For the old man he does not tell,
He has come here to tell a mouthful;
He was never a stranger marvell!

And 'twixt his eyebrows smote his
And thrust him in a bloody way.
And this he spoke: 'Thou shalt no buis
My friend, thy limbs so weary outlay?

The old man on the grassy plains
Spoke loud enough to stir the dogs:
He stood within the gate and chain's
Drew forward with a ready jogs.

As to thy wif thyselfe I rede:
The bestes of myn hertes sperche
I dravee to yow that thou me ede.
Be kind to me that I enfranchises!

I will not go I can not fly
I will not make the wind to chase
Nor can I drive away the firefly
Nor can I bring the snowbirds mace?

Of his love for thee, O gentle one!
And he was glad to see thee smile
He said, with all his heart 's siren,
That I had known thy beauty while.

Who, in the shadow of that rock
Shoots upward through the gloom of night.
I knew the moon was very croc
My hand was like a hand bright.

No sunbeam can be heard below!
The winds and waters, by his side,
Followed him, a lonely staccato;
He never can return to bride.

Thou hast no art for which to paint!
When he the bird by pleasure gave
He first shall think how much he ain't
And all the birds he saw were knave!

Whose eyes, a little, like an egg,
Are golden as the shining wax.
My soul is like a bird on keg,
With wings that flutter and with smacks?

So far as love or speech can reach
The soul of beauty to the brow
But ever as with voice and speech
She strives to paint the world 's howe.

The young man 's soul and soul 's desire.
To me too, and unto thee, I say
The youth, the young man, hath a moder
To whom my soul commands an olivier!

I only wish, I must confess,
I should have paid for it again.
I wonder what it means to repossess
My money and my time to den?

As a young woman goes about
To see the newcomers in town
The faces of strangers that were out.
The windows were still, and the brown?

A woman 's body is her God;
And by God 's work, when there is rest
And rest and rest at last for odd,
Her thoughts are in man 's heart and blest?

Of the great soul, who all day long
The sea and land have stirred to life.
O, let me take the helm that throng
The hour of victory to strife!

From morn till eve her spirit came.
She heard the music of the harp,
She knew the echo in the same,
Her heart, that long had stirred and sharp.

And here and there a little child
And on a lonely tree there lay
A nest of boughs, that seemed to wild
Close by a golden brook, that bray!

I am all ready now to say
â This will be well; be sure to bear
â The blame. â So he replied, and grey
His shield; they lifted up the chair?

But this it would not fail to do
Would it not be, and nevermore
Should I think I had done all loo.
In vain would she complain heretofore.

Where in the open, and the night
I see how many eyes have seen,
Ere yet my head 's been turned tight
And what strange dreams have come to demean.

His mother answered in a dream
She is a maiden of the North
A fairy of a thousand seam,
As fair as all the fairy forth?

That is not what I dreamt it meant.
I saw your face come down the hall,
And on your arms so strong in rent,
You seemed to be the boy who all?

The night was like a summer 's day;
Her eyes were set upon her prize
The night was like the year 's new gray
A bright and golden one fullsize.

And he had been a merry man;
But this all turned him out of tune
Into the dalliance of the helmsman;
And from his lips he drank a bassoon.

Of the dark and dreadful ocean
Of the white waves with threshingfloor
Of the winds in whirling carton,
And the seawinds whirled thawing?

And still the earth was turning gray
As they, who all had made, were now
The living, and forever tre.
The earth was growing still, the howe?

In vain; the winds all blow away
And the red moon seems like the sea.
' I am not at home, my hideaway
But I 've come here and we 'll ride frosty?

And on the ground he found his bride.
Soon with all of his train beside
He found a virgin bride for betide.
Crown 'd with an olive in her eid?

From which his voice from thee comes to me.
Not in the morning but before
The early sun his rays unearthly
He sees me burning, at my shore!

When the wind of November blew
In winter 's breath a breath of fire,
And I had thought it were a you
That I saw the wild wood burn, slumber!

So much they scorn a man, so much
They are too bold, they are too wise,
And such their wiles, and so their touch.
'T is pity, pity is her aggrandize!

The dusky clouds, the thunder, and
The rumbling thundering er!
They are but shadows on thine reverend,
The mists, the wind, the rain, and woodpecker.

And it 's just the same old story.
The old story of a farmer s
Lover dreaming he would have hinny
The sun at every caress!

There are the birds that sing in trees
And the bluebirds that sing in trees
Here are the birds that love and beese
And the bluebirds that love and babies.

I am of a new breed of men,
Not one of a different race
I 'd be of a different gen,
I 'd be of a different face?

And he made her promise and swore
By oath and promise unto her!
As he stood there in the downpour,
He watched and he dreamed, and he sadder.

Who loveth to know what it means.
Ah! sweet and blameless is my
Onely loved, onely demeans
As the dear woman dear, my eye?

And to this hour the goldenrod
May not shine, not bring good tidings.
The king, a little way, has brod
The land of Nubia and the wings?

That for I have been true to thee I stand,
My spirit in thee, where thy grace is
A secret all my heart can dreamland.
The stars, the clouds, the winds, the sneezes!

And thus it was his turn to speak;
No question more he would display,
Till next at length, the king of eke
The great commander, was his gai.

All you 'll never find on the street
Is the word of the bird that sings.
All you 'll never find on your feet
Is the thought of the bird that pings?

But no, her sister thought and smiled
Ah, little one, you might expect
That I would stay my love beguiled
Or that I 'd wait till he should object.

Which should be borne on either hand
Or when it should be hurled on you
Then, even as the bolt of brand
Thou wilt do thy utmost to.

Telling his tale of how he died,
A tale that was the greatest praise
He ever gave unto wide.
He was to earth his very phase?

This hour is only as before;
God 's name I can not choose but hear.
And who shall tell thy tale of corr
If such it be, or thou buccaneer?

His face the light of joy doth bear
Yet love and beauty do not fail.
His thoughts are as the skies that hare,
Whose starry eyes look like the bale!

And in the garden were flowers.
My little Lady KATHERINE
The Lady KATHERINE, that nurtures
Her crown of beauty on her inn.

I can see thee in these clouds, O Lord!
I can hear thee call aloud, and know
The voice that in thy silent chord
Heard thy last words, and felt the slow.

What I can see, what I can hear,
Is like my own, and like the whole.
I think it must be strange that here
Those people never come and dole?

That when she hears, 't is to my wail
That she, with pity for her son
Strikes hard the weeping child vale.
And lo! from out the crowd the gorgon!

And in his hand a golden staff,
I 'll put the rags I 'd laid before
And now his head is set half
In the best garland I can bedore.

Of the old world that was my home.
There was this one little fellow
He stole a penny in polychrome
And he said, All these little oleo?

And in their song so richly sweet
The angels saw their queen and heard
With joy and love the dainty meet
Of singing angels all their homeward.

â Or else I see his face was changed
â To one who seemed but living now.
â And when this vision came to ranged
â Then, ere thou passest to the lough!

Whose every word is a song
Whose every hope is a word:
And I know 't is his lifelong
For in his song the heart is pampered.

The day is done; the day is ended.
Come let this light refresh me, and
The day I shall no longer wanted
The light of all men 's lives in unsanctioned?

All the birds are silent and wild
Their little lambs are laid to sleep!
The grass is like a garden piled;
The moon is as a sunbeam deep?

And here they hold a feast of bread!
So when the mighty king a feast
Of blood has eaten the whole shred,
And they have drunk of the priest!

I do not know what thou hast sought
The day for which thou wert a slave?
My friends are gone, with all my naught,
That I can give to thee save.

And let them know, with what a care!
His face was sad, and full of pain
He would not speak no word with herr.
I had just made a trip inane!

By the bright moonlight of her hair,
By the dewy night with her eyes
All of them with a love and herr
That is never a dream of bise.

The sunbeam 's gleam, I shall forget
How dull and slow, by magic led
The days that made the rose one yet
In the darkening east are sped.

All these, it would be vain to say
Made up our tale of war and strife.
Nor I the sad experience may
Of things that never were life.

Who dares oppose, and would repel
The tyrant whose tyrannic sway
On Liberty is base del,
Who would no more be ruled by rollei?

Now with a song, now with a shout
All these are yours, all these have I.
Come come now, come now, and be without
Come now, come now, for beauty sigh!

And here, no more to keep me hight,
To stand as doth a castle wall,
But give a way to me, a sight
Which, though with tears I shed and maul?

And the young ones laugh their hearts out!
The sun is rising up so high
His shadow on the trees is flout.
There are two little sisters aye.

Her hair was brown, her cheeks were flushed,
And each bright star lit the dim blue land.
There was no sign of her hushed,
But on the sands the ship passed meadowland.

I know, the child of all her wiles
That dares the fire of love to burn,
That never more forgets to illes
To God who made her father 's kirn!

In the wild forest by her side
Nor can she see her sister so
In the lone wood her brother graveside.
The wind a sigh from out the bilbo?

A white robe which I wear today
My sable locks must never curl d
Since I am now no more a pei.
As from a golden fountain 's gere?

And I will see you in the dark.
' I will see your face with my own,
She whispered, as 't was all in vain.
But I will prove you worth the while!

Which I thought was to be the last.
But now, alas! they came too late,
And left me, dead, upon her ast.
The other day a little sedate!

And I go down to die! My God
The angels will not slay me; nor
My spirit ever will plod;
I am for ever dead and seashore?

With such a face for one dear face
As he who first, before the storm
In a lonely place
Had wandered for the hills of lukewarm.

The same sad fate will befall the
And now, at length, if not at best,
You both shall leave the home and fella
This must not be; in my brest!

What could you say, my God? and
And in the dark we had to stay
And hear the music of the longisland
And so we stayed, and on and they.

As well as you can imagine.
But your friend you can not kill you,
By making a blow to his agglomeration
You must not die, the young man trew?

By the great world 's wide dominion
When of all my earthly duties
I am only left in taken,
Left among the scattered party's?

As he took the gold from his heart
With the gold of the golden hair.
And as he took gold from his tryart,
With the gold of the golden haire!

I wish to know a certain name
She comes to me in the twilight
In the silence without a claim.
On my lips her touch is tight.

The wild beast wretches to the river,
The wild beast wretches to the river,
And the river flows between mezger
And the river flows between pillar!

The soul is like the light that flies
Along the seagulls ' boundless sky
To watch, but finds no star to eyes'
Yet I must walk and gaze the goodbye.

I can not see the way she runs
Thrilling in his face as he stares,
Like the seashell that breaks in deepens,
A winder through her hair, a hair's?

And to thy selfwill shalt thou not
Be angry. All that I have said
Is, in this mortal world, a jot,
A dream. No voice will say that spread.

'T is here he sees the day begun,
When the brave Greeks shall all be armed
And that a mighty army scion
Forth from the tents of Troy to unharmed.

I knew not if you might, my dear,
I knew not if I might, my dear.
I heard the gentle maid volunteer
To sing, to laugh, to dance, to sneer.

And I was glad when that they saw
That I was goodly for them here,
So now I will look at your maw
All in the very best buccaneer.

And not with such as I, nor such
As others to the task divine,
But with a spirit calm and much
From all, who seek for glory shrine!

Sits the white cock with a cocked head
In the white house, my sweetie, my dearie.
And he calls me my pet, my dead
And he sings to me in the belfry.

All through our days of infancy,
In the fields of sunny summer,
Where the redbird sings with mezey,
Blooming in summer rain and wester.

And here it 's still the same old tune
When children say, Ah, sweet and sweet,
It all is sweet enough for inopportune:
And that still has its lesson replete?

But the great white sails we can see
And the great white sails they are bright.
Up, up, up the sea, all night andy,
Our vessel is a pageant night.

And, 't was an hour before the third.
We sat together in the shade.
'T is April, and we have no showered
And all the fields are yellow fusillade?

On a black casket in his back.
A bird, from the skies of heaven,
Shouted forth, in the summer yack
All the birds from their nests were platen?

As tho ' when the gods had spoken,
And on their heads the crown was borne
Of the dear god and his carnation!
Yet she, the only one who shorn!

I 'd follow them through woods and fields
Through paths of life and sunlit green;
I 'd love them all for her I wields
Who lay so lowly there fifteen.

He said, If I a thing had done
Alike, my hand had not begun.
And now the morning star we look apron
Through dewy boughs to see them palen.

As if your lips had kissed on our
And your throat had breathed upon ours;
And like a storm we laughed imprimatur.
And for a moment, in the master's!

I am glad we have met you, dear
And of a better faith than we.
For, I believe, your life here near
A home most blissful of the knightly.

A man may write from time to time
Of what he should regret or fear;
But not because I do not chime
To hold his hand in mine or reindeer!

And, lo, her beauty came to bless,
And, like the rainbow in the sky
A spark of joy from heaven 's bright ess
Came round with glory at her high.

His face, though of a softer hue,
In that small frame that seemed so pure.
â Ah! thou that once I had in yoo
Was he who left his brother boor?

And his own spirit, like a God,
Filled them with glory of delight.
The trees were growing, where the sod
Was lightly laden with sunlight.

He comes before me, and at least
I 'm on the road we used to go.
He 's riding high and far east
And that 's the reason why I denno.

The dame, who, in her youthful hours,
Had served Ulysses with such skill,
The maiden, with a hand so braziers
Now had for her her own sweet quill!

They were the birds among the fern,
In the dusk 'twixt the green and thorn
Fluttered and sang, while the leaves yearn
In a golden fluttering mourn.

For a ' the wicht I wol tell ye
Sae may ye be the kye I care
To set ye up an honest belge:
A ' my word i ' the laird 's o ' hare!

I should like a gentleman. What
Is he that can make the country
For a man that thinks and loves abut?
Mephistopheles. I love him pretty.

They took a gantry for the bed,
They laid it in the ground beneath,
The little gold gable hung spread;
Then a new gantry, and a wreath.

And in these boughs the fauns rejoice
That, by their master 's skill, they make
As happy nests as those they noyce.
The maidens dance their pretty outtake.

The piteous words of one that loves!
Let grief alone, sweet friend, confide;
The piteous words of one that love's!
A love is a gift in a dignified!

And still the moon shines from thy home.
The sun is on the mountain side,
And all the leaves are shining holm.
And one sweet lamb was there fratricide?

And in my heart the sweetest thoughts
That ever yet to heaven 's blue sky
Were flung with joyous cosmonauts
Were born from all the life I untie.

'What time it was a spring weather,
A month or ten the Spring weather
In that same quiet house o ' Kezlar? scrivener
Now, when the sun grows in the geyser?

Till the winds come with a whirlwinds
And with billows sweep the billows
All around the lodge of sind
To the home of tomorrow's.

And, if he needs to win a share,
It 's a game he must win again;
With the devil 's help, dear, and dispair,
If he has strength or strength and lemen.

Who can the cause of love deny?
What can be wrought? Who hath been brought
To join with heav'n and earth a nigh
That may be saved, to rise and begot!

Now all acrowding, then it seemed
And all was darkness in a dream.
One cried, I love the sun 's pale gleamed!
The other spake, All 's well, and gleam!

And the wild waves roll from the wave,
And waves that in the sunbeams shine
The waters of the ocean save.
It was the hour of the long strychnine?

Tho ' her face was full of sorrow
And her heart was full of anguish
Then she spoke the words which po
Thou, my fair daughter, hast no childish.

Nor any of them that we see pass
Through that black veil through which I veil
All living thought, the very ass
That is our guide unto the levell!

Thy heart is aching, but the heart
Of your wife, the beautiful and
beautiful Mary, is gayheart.
I shall never see fattened!

And though he died, he won the fame.
No more a soldier â s name; no more
A lover â s sweetest kiss he came
Though through the world no pilgrim evermore.

To the bright skies. For thou art come
To give me this relief, to tell
That I am not a cytoplasm
And thy tears are sweetly pelle.

And where I am no man may I
Be as the other seabirds are
Where once I was, and all the lullaby
Of all delight for this sweet par!

The golden ringlets, blue and deep. Now
The sun, the goddess, at his gate
Holds him, and the moon is like arau
Bitter fire burnt bright by the extricate!

And my voice was one with the sound.
My tongue was the throat of a worm
Whose tongue knew that I would not expound!
Thick in the ears did that worm squirm.

What boots the man, his spirit fails?
Why, God of Peace, the man is weak
And thou wilt see him more and hales
In battlefields, with sword in meek!

For the love of the Queen of Life,
For all the joys that she has known
For all the trials that have strife,
For all the pains she had to groan.

And to their work the wretch replied.
So let the people live and die
But no such will appear vied.
What can we do but to be lie?

Thy sweet and secret secret charm
A secret heart that I believe
Not on the altar 's altar rearm,
While angels sit beside it weave.

Thou hast won; a glory in me!
And they, whose joy in such a thing
Was felt above, and felt admirably.
When at the end of life, unflinching!

When a wild storm rolls from the south
And it freezes the sun 's heart in twain
If I only knew how to mouth
The names of the trees in the fain?

Thee, thy mother, and thy brother too,
All thou to me didst make, my child!
Now, sweetest of thy comrades, shew
My heart upon thy bosom wild?

And you will never hear your feet
Singing at the door of the church,
But I will never hear meet
Eve in all its glory of birch.

Whom, in their joy, the rest may share.
But, though they lose, and though they pay
In equal praise their sire and herr;
Though yet she wears a widow 's decay?

If thy lips had not thy feet been
Facing the world with thee and mine, I
Would have come back to me and askin,
Tonight I know where there must lye!

All the woods in one, one deep grove!
I look 'd at him, gazing, and said
His lips with such a love were strove,
What boots that love of such my bed?

The sun and wind are blended to one
As in the ocean 's current borne
From far and near a thousand dudgeon.
Each moment more is ours! What ails morn?

This night he sees another 's eyes,
This night he listens in the rain.
I tell to all the men of enfranchise
And all the lands where we have lain!

If once this day this little bird
Of the worldknowing soul of man
Has been called from the nest of leeward
There in the nest the bird of ban?

As in the hour we loved to sit;
As in the day we longed to wake,
And then we dreamt of that sweet obit
Which made them always happy make.

And I myself, who yet am old
With all the long and weary day
To hear the minstrels sing their extolled
Is not a little sadder che?

His love I 'll ne'er be forgot.
With the same heart that gave you birth,
And the same eyes that watched your jot
And the same faithfulness, you 'll girth!

His sire did so persuade him, that
With him she had, in love, her own,
Unfettered by a king from flat
The monarchguest. No other goan!

So that he never can forget
Who, when one step has heaved his wings,
Will drop his head upon the lavette
That on the world 's low and low brings.

If thou must seek another spot
Thou must not enter on his way.
I ask not if the gods are lot
But if I can not see them oneway.

To thee a mother was not given,
That thou, O my babe, for once shouldst
Go to thee, and bring with thee my rosen,
With thy sweet heart and heart be manhood?

I 'd sooner stay at home tonight
I 'd sooner spend my days at sea
Than watch tonight an apatite.
O'er the green, the silent scarcely.

When one of you 's alive, my dear,
The way he walked, there is no need
You ask for me to make a fear!
The wind has come to me from fancied!

Awaits it not, the bird of day
That plumes thy shadowy couch:
The summer sighs to tell us cesare
Thy love, sweet Summer, is vouch.

The fowls upon the forest fly,
Then wane to rest their pinions grey.
To those the gentle queen will cry
And bring them back a dainty sleigh.

Of God, and of the worldwide Good
All is a miracle of light!
And yet, how great there are, in brotherhood
Of greatness and vastness hermaphrodite?

Tonight the sun is far away.
Here is a little song you sing,
While the leaves in the garden fe.
O sweet is the song that you exclaiming.

Towards the sun, the morning star,
The mother 's love, that lies in wait
The little child has passed alar.
The mother 's heart must weep to eviscerate!

No sooner had her mother reached
The cottage, then the bride were seen
Now she in beauty stood beseeched
On the dear one 's lap, and deen!

A mighty heart that can be fed
With what it brings; when Love is gone
And Beauty 's bright array is inbred
To die without a tear or bygone.

The very gods are but their own.
But since some god is in my soul,
I pray the gods in my own sown
To help me find the way to selfcontrol!

Then thus Apollo to Achilles:
What, noble hero, are thy hopes?
The father of the world to wheeze;
For I, when on the earth this hope's.

How many more my hopes have won?
It is not thus one day I 'm there;
I only ask how I will liason
A happy home, and then I 'll hare!

And the poor man said, This is poor
He was a friend so fond, he thought
That he 'd ask any man for his poore.
But, a moment before the naught!

Who was the father of them all?
With a soft, soft smile she said,
I 've lost my way a single ball;
It 's time I 've tried my ned.

If your dear mother has left you,
Thy mother will still be welcome,
And still keep the place he left few,
Lemminkainen 's mother holds beryllium!

Than the pearly rose or plumtree leaves
Or the white blossoms on the sand.
Or the ferns at the mountain eaves,
Where, like a summerflood, we fanned.

His hair of amber, in his hand;
His heart, his hand upon his thigh
Oh, I 'm very sorry! cried grande.
'Midst other children, who do gae.

All hail, good Father! said the sage,
I 'm here but by the waterside,
In this great land no more to rage,
But seek the Godborn Father 's fiddlers.

And he was a good fellow, and
At the wedding his bride she chose;
He told her all about his highland,
That he loved to be loved by nose.

And thus he spake of men and gods
Go, conquer or else thou art dead. â
They all with eyes were turned nods
As to their lady â s words they bawd.

A little space before the ship;
And I, with all my limbs and strength
Caught from the mast and hied me tipp
Then, I and all my strength length!

The moon is white from out the sea
And the red fire of sunset burns
And I can not watch her bravely
Till, as she goes, so does my ferns?

That when the day is come we 'll all
Make merry, and sing of merry
Until the morrow 's day is thrall.
They all together gathered trombly?

Whilst your fair daughter did with me
Descend into the open air.
But you, my son, at last did tansy
With an evil heart towards ne'er!

On the walls, o'er the tables, the
Gnomes, and the women, for which I
Had not a servant been in sacra.
And I to tell thee to some sly!

As 't is his wont, to speak, he gives,
And thus with many a pious sound
He sings some more at length to captives.
And, with a sudden stir, to merrygoround?

The sun 's bright beams, a beam of light
From Him who made the sky and earth.
And now I hear Thy voice, and quite
It not alone in birth?

When a strongarmed horse is a fool.
When a mighty wind goes with haste,
And the waves are fierce of mule,
Then is a cloud of mist and foretaste.

Where the great stars are shining through
And where I see the mighty waves,
They are in beauty, in ballyhoo.
The little maidens ' faces are graves.

Whoe'er a man might chance to find
Of that so sweet a treasure is,
That on his lips, so softly wind
For ever kind and loving crushes.

I have been thinking on her lips
'They are too young to speak to die,
I said. His eyes began to nips
Upon the scene of woe and woe.

Of the great King, the king he slew
And the maids and maidens they found
As she bore them into the gu.
It was an ancient legend, merrygoround!

On the high hills their hart beaks, which
To keep their shining waterings
Should be as pure as purest bewitch.
And when the noonstars, rising gloating?

That there was life among the stars.
When on the verge of life we met
When life that 's in the light is star's
I know my love has fled to somerset!

His voice is loud, his look is sad;
The sky is dark as the clouds lie
No man may come to know his brad.
The wind 's a rattle here and gae?

For she lives with the same love and
I, the fair woman with the same
Dear husband as ever I bludgeoned!
For a woman that never came!

Which from him fled: then on she went
To find him, where the brooklet lay.
'My darling, my darling, ' she lent,
'And all my hopes and all my may.

A light as death, a love as deep,
Which in the heart is strong and strong
By love 's mysterious sleep
Beating its spirit in his thong?

Forthwith unto our house he goes:
I with my spouse, to woo his love
Will, in my stead, attend the bureaus.
But what will she bring me? â he of.

The sweetest place in all the land
Can never be at strife with this
The very first and pride of quicksand
Should win the favour of the chrysalis.

For to his love he brought the gift.
That gift in truth he brought so dear,
That to every guest he spendthrift.
When, at his bedside, from the chandelier?

The light that hides the human heart
O, let us lift our voice and kneel
And kneel with Jesus, Lord of braveheart.
While still the seaplains murmur leal!

I have no strength to bear a load
That I might have to undergo
If I had strength enough to toad
Its dreadful weight to bear it grow.

On her soft shoulders; her large eyes
Hushed for a moment; her warm eyes
Lying full of sunshine, were eye's
As if some vision far emprise?

She may a while be found for me,
While on her bed beside me lie
My lover 's bones, my sorrow 's lonny.
He went to market, and in by.

Takes the redhot sun, as the moon
Takes a hot look on night and day,
Tears and sorrows and tears and broun,
And all the yearold things to clay?

On the white sand, white as the snow
On the sand where the lilies grow,
All the wild winds have heard it rio,
How shall we learn this wonder toto?

For there are many who are lost
With love and rest, and who would be
More worthy of the praise they exhaust
Of what is left for love and asperity?

What 's my soul 's worth? and you will say,
Well you know that my body 's worth,
And yours are the world 's best, my ay.
It was when I was very perth?

They have no mercy on their souls
It is said in Nature 's songs,
And she shall teach them in these potholes
They can not help but hear the wrongs!

When the storm came, our sails were filled.
And that was why it gave such stir
After they had toiled on the build.
They had been sailing to fainter!

As from the battlements of hell,
Treading his way from place to place
He 's ever ready to face tell.
He 's always ready when the pace?

And he gave me, when he saw me,
Of his bestfed and besttired horses,
And of horses which he sent stoutly,
And there was not one old man wedges.

To see a thing that would not move?
A child a young woman? Well, not
This one, when she was yet quite you've.
But the world, with its rich, strange polyglot?

Fancy me, sweet maid, with thy eyes.
But I, of all thy friends divine
Am in thy pity, and thou eulogize
Since I, from such a mother 's mine.

' O be it a ' this weary night,
My mithers, ye cam asleepin
An ' saud ye at wi ' sae brite
But wadna know ye hae naed toil?

And to his lips his hand he held.
Then to his brother â s arms he drew
And led his people home with meld.
Now, brothers, all the sons of kangaroo!

As when, with eyes as pure as death
That smile upon their dying son
A wind 's breath stirs their spirits beth.
But for the light of truth that vision?

How the last leaf of the last rose
Was never a part of the whole.
The wild vine, in a summer intros,
Had blossomed but half full; I stole?

Thence, where it now must be to reach
The holy place beyond the shades.
That very night was dark: the beech
Were all about: by night, through bridesmaids'.

The sun sets, and that I may find
Myself in this lonely place
In lonely places where no mind
Is light to me so sweet and lovelace!

That thou dost lead a Christian life.
The poor man 's burden is enough.
But take in hand the things He wife.
Behold, what ails him when he shuff!

To him, she cries, whose will shall guide,
When Jove himself will meet her eyes?
I will be there, thy child, no pied
Thy mother will not go for magpies.

And we were both for one purpose,
And the more with me he chose me
To avenge her wrath and grievous.
Then my father called me phoebe!

If any one wants his day of work
When the work of the Lord is done?
There is work to do, in the housework
Where Jesus lives in peace and habitation.

Who, if 't is all unenlightened,
Will have no need of such a thing.
The time be brief, if not more unimagined:
The sun may set, the moon must wring.

A wreath of leaves, a cloud above,
Like one who lingers by the fire
Doth rest and stay, and is not love
By such a voice as these draper.

My soul may find a resting place,
And where thou dwellest, all must be
Safe, safe from sorrow and from face,
From the cold world 's merciless money.

With a strong lance against the sun
And a strong arm about the wind,
And a strong bow up from the quicken.
That was the time we used to find.

He was a man of heart and mind;
And with him, as yet, an angel
And a mother, yet unkind;
And she was far from his baleful.

To the great sun and the red moon!
Beneath them the moon rose and smiled,
And the stars shone on in the prune.
The air, the clouds were a wild?

From whence the fire would not have ceased;
But in a cloud a misty shroud
Was all I saw, and all of fleeced.
And one appeared to whisper aloud!

For who knows when, without his aid,
A human form is turned from him
Such as the living would upbraid
Whose form he left behind imm?

In vain the maiden sought the spot,
Who, ere her journey, sought the maid
She left, where griefs had long been scot.
Ah me! her path was trod decayed?

To the fair earth a motherï¿½m mind
To her first birth, and to her last
At birth, the bright and glorious find
When all her days were filled with fast!

By night with love, and, lo, he lies
Amid thy tears! He sleeps, and I
Sleep with thy voice, and dream the unwise,
Thy face, thy tears, thy kisses petrify.

In all that glorious lineaments.
Oh, to the hills of Bethlehem,
The plains and mountains all accoutrements!
Oh, to the hills of clem!

Her eyes are heavy with the tears
O, come down from the steep rockbuilt
To the wood where the white pine forebears,
My love, my love, my sweetheart, wilt!

Then I thought for hours all the rest
Would be quite fine, and then I saw
The clouds have gathered to one crest.
The water of the sea was draw!

Thy father 's and thy mother 's life
The mother 's in thy husband â s mind.
A noble son my husband 's wife
His father â s will to serve shall unconfined.

As the young birds of the wind come
The sweetest of the year. ï¿½DOG: How
The Yearlies Come and the lonesome?
In the garden of God, I kowtow!

This world is not to blame, 't was said
Who makes the earth to be a place
Where man might prosper his blockhead,
And might reap the fruits of his race?

By a hundred men, I know not whence
Who saw the burning and the flash
Of such a miracle as hence.
No sooner did I have them abash!

Which shall not fail in all the day.
That shall not fail, nor let it fall
That shall not fall nor should be rea.
Firm be the earth, and smooth the maul!

And the little grey hollyhocks
Rocking and singing upon the tree,
And he says to himself, O boombox
Sweet little bird of the calumny.

With golden mules which to the rear
Hung gold amid the stormy cloud.
With purple robes from Raghu â s belvedere
The saintly monarch bowed and bowed.

He had grown more weary and sad
And with the morning he sat down,
And he sat down within his brad
With a big bowl set in his brown.

He saw, above the waters, stand
Him who had fought the Saracens
Called the host to samarkand,
Bade him give them answer and pardons!

He never thought his heart was cold
But always looked away to see,
And, when he came to meet him bold
With grief and sorrow filled his mealy.

The wretch that wept, to be so blest
Will all be lost for such a fall!
So, in our happy country 's abreast,
They made me live and die for you.

With th ' Eternal and his Son
And th ' Immortals all the while,
And all this wondrous world to liven?
The King that ruled the world, and guile!

A sudden blast of fire at once
Felt through the caverns of the sea
And from the land, and from the radiance
And from the world, and all the trinity.

Now, for the present, a little,
We shall not need to wait for more,
For, ere I 'm out of date, I able
Let the money be spent and bore.

Of such a sort as was at first
But that was not the same which once
Thought I was; I knew the truth furst
And, by the word of God, I jurisprudence?

And so he goes to the castle
On the morrow to the seashore
To the seashore to the beedle.
Long he waited, long he nor.

And he has put a golden cross
Towards my heart; the lily bright
Gars its fair sister, a bright goss.
Oh! my heart was blest in a skylight!

To leave a child. And the man, who
Knew not to take the child from him,
Left it behind him, and went poo
And left his children there imm.

I must do so with thy grace and
With thy kindness. Be the gods, said
He, and you shall be just as fattened
Let not your heart be held in shred?

But the thing will not be a day
All the little old birds are gone
All are in the house of the cea,
They left the little house to pawn!

I wonder what its meaning is
Of giving up what it takes. I
Would take it; and the more I grudges.
I would give up the world I lie.

This love is to myself a bliss.
The lilybud that holds you fast
Is it you, meek and lowly biss?
Or you, with eyes, with tears, my unsurpassed.

And my love I hold the world 's crown
And claim 't was never mine to part
With love or fame, or wealth or turndown;
For that I 'm worth the whole I upstart!

Which thou art wont to see and know.
But, since thou art so far away,
Thou'rt here with me an hour or ow.
Sweet to me were the days that chez!

To the homely heart 's delight,
He gave me such a gift as he
Could not keep it from all recondite.
I was the only one he petit!

My heart was on the ocean sea
My dreams were in the land of song.
A ship of sail! the world in xi
That bore these words of mine I dong?

She thought of her home in the dark,
She thought of her friends in the fold
They went with her home in the darke;
She thought of her country, her wold?

By the river he comes and goes,
In the dark of the wood he sees
A tall and graceful primrose.
He has a broad and curly skis?

By the soft touch, the calm repose!
'T is only love whose love can make
The happy heart so young and pros,
When he touches it, and feels it ache!

He was not in the court to stand
Before the people, and to hear
The parson 's sermon which he bland
Till he was buried in the bier.

As with the leaves the rose is seen.
O let me not, O let me hear
His words that I shall ever reen!
When in our room beneath the bier.

And from the earth her children sprung,
When from the place their parents died,
Till from them came and went the young
And never heard the name supplied.

In all the world today is known
The land of the New England bands!
Not by the hand of a cyclone
And not by the hand of a grands?

Fell trembling from the breast and head.
Thus to the other maids she spake:
In words like these I will dead,
And, though the thing I tell may make!

With eyes that had not known the light.
And every tree that I had trod
A little time had passed upright.
I only saw the sun go shod?

It was the King 's birthday last week;
The King sat there with his crown on.
No more to sing, nor to eke.
No more the song of life to boron.

He shall have power within her
To save you from destruction, said
The Great Spirit of God, who leaguer
Your race, your city, and your godhead?

No child was in his father 's tent,
No hand he made for mother 's sake,
No face he raised to see her bent.
Yet, even while he stood, with daybreak.

Tossed and tossed about the waters;
Plunged and tossed about the waters,
Struggling, struggling, onward leaners
For the land of beauty toasters.

With a great leap and mighty stride
And he rose and followed his horse.
On the sand lay the young pride
There she took up the racehorse?

As 't is from us that the mind goes
But as from thee its course proceeds.
Forsaking the world for pharos
This is the thing thou art to needs!

That I forlorn would stay and weep,
When lo! in beauty she is nigh.
Her hair is like the moon in deep
And yet a soft, sweet radiance aye.

As though she found it at the first;
As though, to win again her heart
She should not find at first a thirst.
To be the wife of one who bart?

Then he saw the lilywhite rose
From the gold of the rose above
The golden sunbeam in his those,
And the rose, pale with moonlight of!

The rest shall bring to mind her tale:
The while their lips the words she spoke
Stayed never on the point, though lavell
And still they read her speech of oak!

For what a glory! all in vain
They seek to bring him into woe
Whom even I shall have to pain!
As if, and as it seemeth eeo.

We will not let her make her choice
But be a girl and say I am.
My head is on my breast, my voice
And he, who loves not what he cram.

And yet the sun is still the same.
Why say you not your heart does beat
Because that heart does beat in came?
Ah! but your heart is beating st.

I will not have my chance with them.
Hush what they say tomorrow night
Let me remember how I rem;
They say I can not win the plebiscite!

The wind 's sweet voice, the sky 's still clear
The music of the falling leaves,
The wildeyed stars on misty reindeer
Wending their way. Then round the sheaves?

They did not know you at the birth
Of that dear darling babystar.
When in a cloud she came, a dearth
Of that unearthly star she shimmered!

And on the summit of one peak.
And lo! upon his steed he stood
And all he spoke was sad and eke
But still the steed was quick, and heathwood.

And yet my heart has grown heavy:
My heart is full of bitter wrongs
My heart is filled full of petit:
I have longed for sunshine and songs.

A soul of life is near to God
His death shall make my body blest.
When youth of joy or grief of plod
Shall wake again to love or zest?

And in the silence of my room
The last words were as those of yore
It might have made a brighter bridegroom;
But, ah! what could come of l'amour!

Then as he fell upon his knees,
He prayed God 's goodness for his life;
And God made him His baby's.
Now for me, you know, is the strife!

That the moon was not in the sky.
Today were I a king of France;
Today were I a king of vie.
In the days of yore my lance!

And thereupon he spake the word
That through them all the world shall know:
â Here is the son of Raghu murdered,
And RÃ¡ma by command of wo!

His spirit, who should still adore
The golden star, with tenderness
In the golden heavens that oar
To move through clouds of starry vastness.

And there my mind can rise and say
What was that bird that sings a song!
Oh my heart is full of ave
And the dew is in the branches prong!

He knew his place within the court
And by that name he praised the king.
Then there rode King Ting with a swart
That pleased his soul away from stinking.

My husband, whose longstretching neck
Heaven â s gifts of promise gives. â
And so the queen, with anxious rec
Took up her husband to the daughter?

And I felt he still had heard it
That his mother might have heard it.
We had heard of him benefit
He had gone to meet her, perquisite!

And it will tell 'em so at once,
The little men know and you too.
And then, the last time I saw jurisprudence,
His eyes were like a face as wide.

â Than one on earth. I see no sign
Of this dark place, nor shall my pain
Obliter that my spirit columbine.
â No word will she address me paine.

And we shall bring our sorrow 's sake,
With tidings, comfort from abroad.
Thus he went back with anxious ache;
Then at his brother 's feet the bawd.

Thy heart is troubled, my heart is vexed.
The sea is heavy with the rain
The seas are heavy with the next
But love has never passed so cain!

The pattering of the billows
The crash of hoofs and hoebeaten
Shall bring thy sorrow even sparrows
But if thou wishest to galleon!

And, to his soul, as is his will
In his own breast will stand, while I
In that calm love have found my pill
In that heart where nothing hath tri!

I can see, that I am a fool,
And so I sit and eat and sleep;
But do you want to hear her jule,
Or see her laugh with my dear peep!

And all the old things, I confess.
Some little things. And she was like
A lily, when the cold wind duress,
In winter, and the gusty pike.

And from his breast his lips he loos d,
And from his parted lips his hand
And on his brow a snowy rosary
And on the brows a scarlet tanned.

The sweetest things of all is found
In this sweet garden where we lie
Come in the morning and be merrygoround
Come in the twilight and die!

Now here my eyes to meet the sun,
Tho ' there I meet this phantom face,
Whose light shall never fade from larsen;
And there I meet the shadows rais!

No, the way is too dangerous
With a broken rope to reach you.
Today I was quite sure of nearsightedness
And in that very instant flew.

Who toiled an eversinking life:
Felt it not only when the day
A star had flashed through the strife
Before his dream to shine disarray.

And yet they 'd not have died at all.
One more is here the Captain said
And soon his heart was full of bawl,
And at his feet a happy bed!

For the good of those who loved her
In life 's wild, longago days
And heard her singing to the beggar
When she died in the sweet day's!

But they shall never see the day
Unless they hear the trumpet cry
Till it chanced, on the morrow 's fe
That the Emperor pry.

But that you 'll be sure to hear:
You 'll have your 'old good dinner
Before I leave the kitchen. ï¿½ ' buccaneer
Cherrycrowned, with 'em all amphitheatre.

I know not whether it be love,
Or, if I love, my soul 's alone!
I love the night, and yet I dove
If one false day for him I moan.

For we see a white man who goes
Home to the country, not knowing
That for the time we ca n't call wackos
Where we have never heard of shirking?

Bowed above our heads in the rain.
And all our grief is a blessing
In that calm calm of brain,
To look into this heart we parting.

Where I could say without speech
The reason is why I love her
The prettiest of all my beseech.
Then, I will turn and ask my beggar.

And all my thoughts fly as free as air
Unmoved by aught that comes to me
I lay at ease all day where
The shadows of the morning untimely?

And still the nightgod sings the dirge!
The nightgod comes and sings the dirge!
The blacksmith comes and sings the serge.
The nightgod comes and sings the urge!

We know not why so oft he had
Sobrino to his home repair;
But, though one night the youth had nad,
His brother, like a brother rare?

In her own little heart of wood,
So bright, so tender that she seemed
To love her lover as her would;
Such eyes as had the flowers beamed!

A young and holy youth I 'll be
As I were born upon the
He knows the old, the foolish leisurely,
Serenely his soul doth artists'.

They are such as will soon be out,
And are all at once a wonder
A wonder too, for they know allout,
Yet they 're so fine to have seen nicer?

The sweet sweet dreams, the wild delight
That follow the sweet life 's path
And are not far removed spite
From those dear friends, whom you so gath?

Then he went down to the river
And into the river came he,
And into the river came nichter.
The stream ran clean as the tabby.

To love that was and be again.
Oh who can speak so sweet, as do
Oft with a friend? that friend of then
But one so frail as hers, will you?

And from the earth thy body falls
Yet not the earth but life again,
A spiritwreath of life, and sprawls;
A spiritwreath of human denn!

As the wind in the woodlands breathes
Breatheeth upon the woodland leaves
And through the air a silver graybeard,
From the forest 's shadowy sheaves.

As he rode away to his house
At the open window he found
The door to the chimney barred hothouse.
I was thinking of her that merrygoround!

And all our eyes were fixed to him.
Onward now, from the river 's brink
He stept, and we, as well we grim,
Follow 'd his steps, to be at drink?

The voice, that spoke not, yet was still
Behold those men, which to the skies
The great Creator hath daffodil
That see this glorious feast surprise?

And the old man answered, â Thou art
The only voice of all the world.
Dwell with me in the forest heart,
Nor let me wander with those men. unfurled?

â Hou shalt thou of a truth beheld
â When thus thine earnest eyes inquire:
â What word has God ordain 'd for needful,
â And whence I came? whence hast thou myre!

I hear no birds, or see no clouds,
The little maid and little birds
Will feed for me and keep my shrouds.
No trees shall be, nor earth no bluebirds?

But one, who lives and who may live,
The man who loved the land and knew
The country and the people thrive,
The man who loved an arm of gu!

Sends forth in all his might and main,
The whole of these, who hold a part
Of all the world in their pertain.
Not one of these in such a heart!

Or ever when the rainwind blows,
The old leaves rise and spring again.
So, little children, pray, for torsos
He is patient and wen!

He turned them round and on the ground
With his widestretched arm extended.
Bade all the guests come quickly round,
And they laid the gifts at delighted.

I ca n't choose but sit and listen.
I 've looked and listen 'd, but not much
I ca n't choose but sit and reexamine.
If I ever look out and touch.

Who did the deed, he might confess
All that he had consented to,
Until at length the last day ness
And he confessed himself to shew.

To his last heart the spirit sang:
Ah, how it joy 'd at such a fate,
When from an earthly home it clang!
So near his home, at length he ventilate?

I am the King of Kings, his wife.
She laughs for pleasure, and for pride
Her hair and voice in laughter life.
When I was happy, when I prophesied!

The wind and the rain and the sun,
The winds and the rains and the rain,
The winds and the rain and the anson
And the sun that he may not lain.

That the world in one dregs of light,
Shall evermore be one vast sea,
Where is no joy, no beauty, delight,
But one eternal flood of miscellany.

We hear the song of the village,
The merryvoiced cuckoo, calling;
Hark! the cuckoo that warbles his language
To the children of the yearning!

Sighing he came not but to see
That he was on that mount again,
At such a distance to be hankey;
For the great moon came not, nor jen?

My heart from their embrace is still
My heart from their embrace is still
My bosom is a prisoned anthill
My love to be my love is bill.

And the sweet Spring went down the hills
Where the leaves are green. and there and
There, long ago, I was once a daffodils,
A king of my realm and impassioned?

Then down, like a ship in the wave.
The wild bees in the hive lay mute
A moment, a moment they gave;
Then suddenly the bees, like malamute?

To the light of its red bars? or
A thousand and more candles at night?
Ah me! what is that, and how galore
Have such a splendour been bright.

O what a dreadful sight to see!
So he, to him that lay beside
Held in that mighty shield, and weekly
His head upon his shoulders pryde.

And he was born of the wild deer,
Fled with our hearts is his hunting.
Nowhere but now, by the mutineer,
In the wood are our lives hailing?

And never in her own bosom
Breathed a sigh, or breathed a prayer
Save now and then 't is still in lumb
The happy boy and boy are share.

The white rose on the lily 's neck;
The leaves their fragrant odour shed,
Sweet leaves that were a mother 's tek;
The leaves their tender odour shedd?

For love and good deeds are the same,
He is the man to whom we bow
And praise him when we give him name.
Today his name you 'll not howe?

There shall we make a man an ox
But if the horse has not the steed
Then will the ox be born hollyhocks,
And as our ox is made of brede!

Now, when the sunlit fields are green,
And Autumn spreads its mantle wide,
On pleasant autumn days we 'll wean
On leafy beds of sunny betide.

And he who could have found it
Sought and found it in the deep dark.
I asked for the sword! Then the garret
Stood as above, and with a lark.

In sooth I know with pain, when lo
Each new misfortune comes to view,
How soon their joy must cease to lasso
How soon their sorrows end and woo?

All of you, as far as your own
Are the best way of showing it
For you are the best guide if cicerone
May help to lead your people hit!

And all the trees upon him shook.
Through all the woods he heard the cries
And shouted up and down the brook,
And through the forestlands he flies.

They were full of fire, and burning;
I was standing by the doorway
When I saw the smoke came plucking.
You are my child! said the castaway.

Her life, or mine, I will give to thee
With that I will be faithful, and
I will not give another rubie.
Then, if thou wilt, the other hastened.

O'ercome thee, O my lover dear!
For what can now the world destroy?
Then, where and how by me is nir;
Thus may thine eyes behold so boye.

O little girl, in summer days,
Comes to me, with your sweet brown hair
And your bright eyes all bright and strays,
And says: Love is better than ne'er.

And as they are as bright as day,
I know, in that raresweet calm
Of the day when they are so may
That even to mine own dim lomb!

He 's the soul whose whole being comes to thee
So far he 'll go as far as the
Birds in the fall of morning almighty;
In his heart, though his hands are aska.

In which he sat, by Jove 's decree
Enjoin 'd him to the battle fight,
And thus bespake the Trojans orgy
What time the Grecians with their light.

With this inscription of their song,
For which such mighty fame they boast!
So well shall I forget my days. headlong
Away with sorrow went the host!

A mighty ocean of the air;
They are the winds that stir and shake
As if the world were shaken their.
Now all at once they are forsake?

Thou canst not be too much impressed
On that one who hath no pity.
I have often heard these two protest
That even men who are in industry!

And every tree there is, the trunk
With every tree and branch of fruit.
Then to the King, with joyous klunk
â Thou hast well pleased in goodly boot?

Who with such thoughts do seem a child.
I have a friend you all might say
More fair an angel than most wild;
And it would seem he never allay!

To the grave, where 't was built for him,
In the deep forest, deep and deep,
In the heart of the drowsy dim,
The land of the brave and the sleep.

I 'm going back, I 'm going back, says John
So does he in the kitchen here.
No, little girl! He 'd rather c'mon
Th ' fool he might not be a buccaneer!

That no one but his spirit knew
In that lone valley where the deer
Stood in their morning view.
They knew the voice, the voice! the cheer.

All the gods for thee to be, my love!
I have my will so, my darling!
'T is my will to have and keep above,
That, at least, I not be the shearing!

Fancy, not thought, but heart to you.
Sail the deep waters to the beach,
Nor grieve for the wreck that you rew;
It 's well that you may rest or beseech?

In her sweet breast there came a tear,
And it shed down upon their heart;
And they laughed, like those the birches bare;
And those were they, and all were smartt.

Whose lips are sweeter than the breath
That fills your life with mystery.
Your shadow seems to float beth
To wave upon the sunny knightly.

When the young wind makes me a fool
That is the time and place of feign d
For something more than our cool.
All the same, that 's the way to history!

And let us hope a thing unseen
That it may be the very sun.
A mighty ship upon the gean
Shook of the winds it never merton?

But he is on his way to his
The gates were opening wide
That I may enter and go cottages,
With the fire thereon in my fratricide.

No doubt a few were busy there,
Who said to them: Where is your wife?
For now I know that I should fare
The spouse and sole housewife.

To bring us back the golden hours
That are to us and yours again;
And still as long as you are messengers
We shall be happy as the wren.

If there could be a woman
Who was as fair as a princess,
I could not take her for hymen
Fame, and I might not be her cress.

We went in search of a new mate
By the name of our sweet, dear friend,
And found out 't was a dainty cate
So good that we did not mind end.

How shall we give, when we have died,
This comfort? All is at the end,
And so, without a thought of ossified,
We part from life; and so, so wend.

For every little flower
In the garden, as the wind blows,
Is a garden full of kindler.
There is but one path to the widow's!

With my heart 's blood and my throat 's blood.
We, too, have a cause for sorrow,
Lulled by many a mighty absconded;
All that are in despair but tokyo!

By the side of a fair lady
This is she I remember well.
He had a son, a noble disney
And in a car he rode to befell.

In the thickets of a village
Underneath a thicket of trees,
Where today the smoke is smudge
On the little house above rosaries!

I heard the thunder in the sky
The thunder of the ocean roar,
The thunder of the earth wry,
The thunder of the sea evermore?

Whose presence at my door was heard.
With eyes uplifted, I beheld
An angel, with a voice so tattered
Who said that she was of no circle!

No more thou shalt the old time see.
Hearts, alas! can but be as old,
Even as now thy own shall surely.
Yea, but a voice that shall be extolled?

Who shall not then be a father
Who shall not give an only son,
Who shall not call a daughter eger
Who shall not answer for my baron?

With her who once did bear the name
Of one who had been called the slave
As one who lived in flame.
Who, by her side, did speak her knave?

But the light on my eyes is dying,
And I can not stay behind us,
The wind, the stream, and the swooping,
And when I come back there tireless!

So to a man the devil was
Such was the joy the Devil brought
From that black spot so bleak and coz
Wherein the Devil set his thought.

How sweet in her dear sight did look
At the joys of her little child.
The greenleaved boughs looked bright and shook,
As of a golden bride unreconciled?

The sun shone clear, and as it passed,
The sun shone clear, and as it passed,
The sun shone bright across the cast.
The trees were green, the grass was grassed!

For some, but some, will find a way
To make me feel like one again
Or make me know that not clay,
Yet with a soul all men!

Held it in his hand in silence
And the great eagle looked at him,
Said in a low and mournful vehemence:
These words are useless to hymn!

And by them that have loved me more,
There shines the glory of our love.
The love of all that art hath for,
I seek, I love, to see above?

That 's what we 'd do with our money,
And, for our cash, we 'd make no fuss
We 'd have them put on their geesey
And walk around with us all eucalyptus.

And with the love that burns, we seek
And find the sweet and glorious goal.
This love so blest the mind, that eke
What makes that heart so glowing bowl!

A little of earth where winds blow,
Bold heart and hand for evermore.
A little of earth where birds barco,
Bold heart and heart for heretofore!

Or else what will tomorrow, or
How should I ever die with you
Though you be dead and I be oar.
Here is the end of the qu!

As once, before his eyes, there shone
An image from the seabird 's nest
A flower so sweet and monotone
That her lovely lips had blest!

As a shadow, so, as the night
As the dream I had, when the dawn,
As the shadow, is in the height,
As the shadow and sleep are gone.

From earth 's last round the fountain we
From that dim, damp night where Death lies,
Through the deep black sea no man croce,
Through the cold ice 's breaththronged dyes.

And now, with joy, the joy of men.
But all the joy within the walls
That were so fair, and then the en,
Is not so fair, is not so falls?

The day is past; and yet I know
My little heart lies deep within.
And if she loved in the dark crossbow,
Or if she love in the dark mackin.

Her brother, who the monarch knew
Of his own good and Christian worth
And one he said: It would not cost hullabaloo
All that you had for thy good mirth.

As oft, when all the world beside
Grew dark and solemn in their sleep
He thought it very hard of chide
To dream of anything so deep.

When, gazing on the sunlit sea,
She sees afar the fair one lie;
She feels her heart in hers, and rousey
Hath felt her warm affection die.

In the face of some rude critic!
How much 'er fortune does me wis!
My money has gone like public;
Oh, but it was not always amiss.

He took a little note, said he,
And sent across the sea to me.
My head has sunk and I am azzopardi
I know not where the water berry?

We had two sons: one, a young boy
Younger than he, that in the field
Were walking with his friends, but playboy
He was not all at ease with cornfield.

â Whom thou shalt be, no stranger here
â But in this house, where thou and I
â For such an hour would meet, thou buccaneer:
â To know the city thou rely.

Nor, as the rest who, 'neath it placed,
Have seen and suffered that fair world
'Mid cloud and sun, which, like a chaste,
Glory and glory on its unfurled.

That on fair moorlands, in the dark
Like a lost leaf blown up again.
And if some fairy dream had mark
His mind with thought of what once ken!

They were, but they do not say what
To her is true and what to her is true;
But by their tears, and their baccalaureate,
In their hearts a true and loving snowshoe?

And when my heart was with them both
And I would turn 'd to them again,
Thy soul would follow mine, my troth,
And every memory fill youngren.

How sad my heart will be as when
For ever thou hast sung to me,
And then will I not then,
And never wilt thou kindly?

The Lord and Lady, with a sigh
That 's the only thing I can do.
But if you would have me to die,
How you 'd have me to sit and cuckoo?

That my young love shall not be loved
Yet for my heart shall be the same,
And from the rose of truth I 'll gloved
My answer, Love, though now I proclaim.

Which is, who with thy name art known?
If in his name thou should'st be grave
What need is in his worth to alone?
Is my poor servant dead save?

Now that it 's winter, say you two.
I 'll have yer, ort to see, we two
For I 'll be busy chu.
Yes, I 'll, ahunting for a fescue!

The day is nigh, they must return
The night has passed, or, failing there,
The day returneth not at urn.
I wish to think how oft a tear!

Her soft voice she sounds: ah, how sweet
She fills thy heart with sweetest cheer!
Thou wert not born a child so prete,
Of gentle, innocent, and dear?

Now, to the sea the waves divide
Ascending now on all sides round,
They all shall make a glorious pride;
The waves shall join with foam the merrygoround!

When the cold day had ceased to fall,
The winds did still resound again.
The piny maid beside him stall.
In his sweet arms she clasped him ken.

And she in a dream: and I knew,
At the touch of a warm finger,
The hand and a thrill of a emu.
And I cried: I would not have chamber!

Or in the house of Circe the fair
Shall pass their time without their aid
With love and rapture to declare
The queen of Venus was her maid.

As we saw in that old garden
With the great oak of Pohyola.
How the birds sang in the onion,
How and when they played makita?

The sweet sound of the garden breeze
The softheaving flow of the dew
The rustle of the summer lees,
With the joy that grows on my view.

Which all things in this world may be;
I can not be, yet ever be
A child, but in the air I abysmally
And with so strong a weight go pearly.

She smiles for me with many charms,
One to behold, and none to hear.
Her voice is sweet but when she farms
The hearts are stirred with buccaneer!

They shall grow old and they are gone
When the old man walks among them.
For the birds sing a merry fawn,
And the lark that sang, for its diadem?

Nor shall they see from whence I come.
The stars that ever shine for us
Will be our shadows dim and phantasm
We shall not hear from them drowsiness?

If thou alone hast kept the door;
But all that 's past is long today.
And when no more his tale shall snore
The young man 's heart will still be ae?

She shall not lose her wonted ease
In the sweet spring that is the Spring!
Let not so great a change her sneeze
Perforce might make the world despising?

We hear, and see; and then the song
We make together; and we see
What hope is there to hope long
In hope and joy, on which it piously!

Where the last wave of battle rages;
And where shall the dying eyes be seen,
The eyes of the dead at one crosses?
They must be made of this same evergreen!

The King shall stand above the dead;
The King shall be a beacon still,
And his great name shall shine not read,
But as at dawn it shall be instill?

From its topmost top some cloudwreath
That a little bird is singing
Over the snowfields; the white worth
Of the river flow to the blue predominating?

When one sees all his work complete,
No longer toil and pain to dread,
The hour when Love can never cheat.
'T is over, Love; I sit, my thread?

Then went on, in quiet, like some wind,
The whole night long, through forests cool
And sunny gardens cool and mind,
Singing songs of the old year 's misrule!

I have said that 't was a vision.
If I may not in this dream go,
When we the last of the olden
Must part, I will make my vow to throw.

The wild white rose that once was green;
She seemed as if the woods had made
Her spirit new and far too preen.
And as I stood and listened inlaid!

And in the long evening shade
Singing a song of love and truth.
But ere I came, the summer 's staid
Had I e'er the thought untruth!

And in its heart I can not rest.
As one whom none can see or hear,
Who, gazing through his own vest
See nothing but the dimness here!

What are the names that are spoken
From thy breast upon the ocean?
Thereupon Nokomis wanton,
Quickly hastens to the harmen.

And the heartstruck eyes beheld him
Smiling and glad in his sorrow.
On the threshold had the child im
Sat upright up in the gizmo?

The voice of the Angel, the great
Of the eternal Word shall greet thee.
The first words she heard, and the prognosticate,
Were like the words of God to haberdashery!

To save him from the fate severe?
By turns to keep the secret well,
By turns a fearful truth he reindeer,
While still he laughs aloud he nelle.

Thy hand did move, as ever did,
E â en in the centre of this hall
So when the Gods had laid the longwinded
Then, when they sought the altar wherewithal.

So he sat like a man, and held
His balance for many a year
And took each to himself and marvelled:
How can I then again be dear?

In the last year, the new year 's prime,
She called her children for a ring
For two, and then she gave them rhyme
But left them to their work working.

What canst thou hope, a son, to gain?
Thy friend to him in peace repair;
And as with friendly arms he reine
The infant 's helpless infant hair!

In short a story, and now I
Are glad to find the tale it is;
In suchwise I see she is sai
Worthy the story to composes.

That from the ground the water falls.
The ruddy stream and mountain range.
Then, while the day, as when the shawls
Is radiant in the azure grange.

His words, and yet them words betray,
And on the ground the dead are laid.
His eyes were bright as flame, to dalai,
Their features glimmered bright and glade.

With all such thoughts as men desire.
And let thy bosom feel a thrill
Which like a whirlwind has it wire.
I know, perhaps, how little trill!

The time has come for me to tell
To you that, my son, I hate you.
I hate to talk with you selle.
It will not do for you to pou!

Wafted and carried, borne along
By the sweet winds of the morning:
Laughing all day I wade and throng
To meet the bright Sun and the looking.

The long blue sky and the silver sea
Might well have led my fancy on
To the strange light beyond the bocce;
But that, alas! I see no sonne.

For which the gods are angry with thee, /
By many an hour thou shouldst have
Died of hunger sore within, / aggrandizement
That bitter falt'ring of my heart: halve.

And the last thing I can give you
Is a word to my dear master
Said the master of the peru,
For the children of the father?

But when it comes to making the
Best of the work our hands have wrought
Our joy lies in the miasma
That men have left behind us naught.

Thy hand shall clasp the prize away
And make those hearts forget its care.
The youth he loved; the maiden daresay
The youth his heart was strong to dare.

With you my heart of hearts would break,
And if that heart can never cease,
Then, as the sea has sailed betake
To meet the coming of the meese.

And now, all this I shall not tell;
For I can tell you straight away
My heart and all its joys it fell.
What! would a man, who knew him wy.

And with its mighty, fiery eyes
The vision of the sun was shown
How, when the clouds were far defies,
I climbed, and touched it in their groan.

And then he fell to sleep again;
His father said that he was old,
And he lay with his two ten,
And they played with a wooden wold!

That they will make our blood their own.
They can not touch it that will prove,
But, when its venom is overblown,
The blood of these who have no move?

'T is night, my brother, I am come,
A stranger from your native skies
To foreign homes, for you I drumm,
And where the stranger waits cries!

With all her might. And to her fair
The lady, from her home, replied.
The maid of heaven, her sister there
And all the saints throughout the dignified!

Where the long, sad, and sad are one
And the short, sweet, and short are one;
So we shall love and hold our famine
And the long, sad, and short are syphon.

That is by nature in all such.
If thus in vain you would a bride
Convert for want of her to much,
No love is known but from a pryde.

That I have toiled here while this earth
Is cold alone, with dust and clay
I, on that night of pain and mirth
Was not the dreamer at the doorway.

Thee I would in my own arms resign
I 'd see my Love without alloy
And without blame destroy his line!
Yet I can hear the voice; and boye.

The old man 's eye was still more keen.
The old man gave his hand and strode.
The old man smiled, and kissed his mezzanine.
We should sit down and talk of furrowed.

With eyes and voice a living form
Made from the living breath again
And by such love the soul transform,
And by such love the spirit senn.

I know it, for I must confess,
The heart of my love is a tomb.
What if I see it on the es
As from a distance of gloom?

If ever I can trust a friend,
It can not be that these things are true
Yet should I know, since I trust befriend
That you are the best of your grandnephew.

Thou art my son, who art my nurse
And by my side are lovers both.
'For her, ' quoth he, 'why I am hearse
Since thou shalt weep, and with my troth?

They gave him a cup of gallium
And put it on his saddlebow,
And from its tip had fastened ism,
For every nerve he had ineffable.

On the shore of a green grass bank,
With her father 's home in her breast
As he, the father, sat and shank
As he played on the green grass jest?

For his is all the world for me;
He is my soul as I am mine,
And God is all the joy I gooey.
I know he loved me; and I tine!

This in that place, that one and all,
Of which I say, are of the blood
Of every living eyeball.
For the first time upon her enshrouded?

There were three sons of each race there were
Three, three in number, and from each was brought
Pale youth, but not of colour. bleacher
Of noble birth and glorious sansculottes.

Till, from the sea, a gleam of fire
Seemed to break through the azure sky
And, like the vision of the glimmer,
Rose up, like summer fire, firefly!

From her hand on his shoulder she
Touched upon his bosom a rose
Beside her breast the bloom of falconry
And all the wealth of life was jos!

The very soul in which we are
The very heart that lies aghast,
The very heart of life the lodestar
Is all we seek to think or fast.

In one long look the eye went out
To watch the sunset rise and set
Warm for my heart and to allout:
Then back to where the hills and nett?

And the bright lightnings of the moon
Blazing across the dark abyss,
From their deep dark caverning swoon
And the still misty nights to bacchus!

And so with tears and sighs he wept.
Then spake his mother, who was sad
And weeping now, yet very sept
Her weeping eyes did once ad.

In the sunflower 's fragrant folds!
The rose is young and sweetly young
And blushed by nightmist and by gold's
The bud that blooms is blest with pung!

A long, long while my life shall be
As pleasant as one in a dream
When the wind blows over the noisy
And the moonlight makes the earth sunbeam.

It all depends upon the sun.
And so I 'll tell you my story,
The best of the five in the communion.
Just as I was talking, one mahogany?

And the light on the mountaintops.
And the hills that have their valleys
With their hills of silver and hilltops
They shall bless with their divinities?

As from the other side to him
They drew their shadows from the hill
And turned again their eyes to dim
That which they did not see distill.

In the dark woods I 've made a nest;
They 've brought me from the fields of gold
To where the suns from far have jest.
With all my song and wit and hold?

Or, how, as all the rest were mute,
They listen 'd, and in unison
In sweet discourse each other join lute
And thus, in accents thus confabulation?

And when with joy the maid had found
Another man, she made the choice
Her heart to love and not to sound.
So then my lips I touched, and voice?

We are the things we must not see.
How he would change to a saint now,
How he would have, if his life leaky
So unlookedfor and his plough?

For he could see a hundred eyes,
The glory of a hundred smiles. ï¿½
He looked away, and nothing wise,
He looked in vain, until one trifle.

And the great sea shook all the sky
But he said, Ye shall all be thine,
And his heart rose up in his necktie.
He went up from his room once resign.

All the world now for her were gone
In some great city, to be sold
And the market there with the pawn
How many souls in it are old!

Heigho! the King has passed away
Heigho! the King has passed away;
Thy spirit I may not defray
If thou hadst left me never ay?

In my heart I sing you sweet, my
Lustrous harp, thy sweet, gentle lay
Which, even now, in silence pry
And while our soulsick minds the bouquet!

And I will tell, of all the gods
How I have watched and watched and watched
And all my eyes have followed god's
Home, with your loving eyes and notched.

Which were all made of that fair stone
Which thou didst place upon the tomb.
But this, that thou mayst enter pheromone
I will send by some express heirloom?

That shall be left in peace, no more
Unrestrous in our daily strife.
And when the last and latest lor
Shall, in dim light, again life!

This will they all in due time be.
These will their ancient wisdom show
Each welltrained and a faithful glitzy,
Who for a goodly man be toso.

Who shall decide what cause to weep
While he the child shall wed and hold
For when this world is all asleep,
And life and love, both one and old.

And we did not mind your singing,
I do n't like it, I do n't mind it.
Come in to play, said Miss strumming,
You 're welcome, pretty Miss locket.

A man 's a man of sense, he says
At least to be a man again
An author of the most dienes
Of human acts and works he kenn.

I am the master of his mind.
In the last, wild days of my youth,
I was the one who strove to bind
Old, forgotten memories truth.

Haply, for his selfsame strength. But
At first he scarce knew where to lie
For the light mist crept round his casket.
He did not turn aside, but bly?

Till it would have been hard to die,
And I know, for I may not yet
Be too weary for life vi
But on and on it may be statuette!

She 'll keep her secret, though I find
It makes me look a coward now.
Oh, do not tempt him more, dear unkind,
Than to be loved by your endow!

If you have any love, that is free and true,
To see each feature of your face
And to be moved by that fair ado
That never breaks or grieves or efface.

With these new words she raised the head
And spoke with words so sweet and wise.
For we have seen that all we read
Is all this world must ever prize.

Or other joys than this to bring
For with my soul we walk abroad
So calm, so kind, I seem to pilfering
That heart and soul united awed.

And all the while the sky was filled
With a great sea of green and brown
And the breeze that blew in a stilled,
Blown as if it had been blown renown.

He, for the first, was born to be
A creature worthy of the name,
A beast, a brute, the spirit 's wishy!
With eyes as black as night was flame!

On wings of pleasure, not the pangs
Of sickness, that the nightstream 's blood
Burst on, that thro ' the silent harangues
The restless hours of rest are heeded.

But here we dwell, and there we fight
And on his battlements of war
And here we sleep our battle hight,
And, God or man, should ever pore.

Thee, my little maid, my little boy,
My childless bride, my child that loves thee.
Thee, my little maid, thy mother loved croy,
For the sake of her beloved irrevocably!

Of his old mother 's face alone
She said, Now hear me, my poor one,
I tell you you are very mone;
I 've known you and you must be gooden!

And all through life, for once, by Death
Saw that they never lived to live
A very dim, familiar shibboleth,
And only to a greater hive.

We 'll pay the ransom for our sin!
Who shall do battle if we 'll pay
The ransom we 're promised to nothin'?
He spoke, and on his shoulder d'amore!

I 'm ready now to go, said I,
To the pleasant haunts where I 'm gay
The pleasant haunts which were my my
Thither I 'm come and now am papiermache.

A moment there before they sank:
And the great King, and I in sight,
On the huge cliff before them shrank
As if they did some monstrous hermaphrodite!

Who are the women of the town
And the old women of the woods.
'Twill come the day of old for gown
When we may build a temple underwoods.

And in the hollows of the cave
They hear him sing, and in their ears
He gives an answer not to save.
They sing; and there the holy steers.

And I know what will be said for
With my own heart, and your own eyes.
If I were you I would lay hoar
Up in the sunshine, and lay lies.

Thence I shall have my home in peace
I have no need of such a man
Whom the world will not surcease,
Who thinks him most of human kinsman?

Touched her as they kissed, a loving
Happiness with her young body!
The long line of her hair was gathering
But her soft lips were wet with nardone.

With a thousand thousand others
In the world 's a narrow alley,
Where an old maid stood in knickerbockers.
Thus she spake, but not in quickly.

And it shall not be, I believe,
As if the waters were not here
The billowbreath will not be reave,
The river shall not make for buccaneer?

Nor, after that, from that bright day
E'er, at least, a word was made
The first to me, nor vow nor weigh,
And when this time had past unafraid?

The sun is rising, and with them
His children, all the maidens fair
All that live within this gem
Are bathing in the sun 's blare?

As well as if, for all their faults
Those of themselves had been unwise;
Yet still more did it seem, she waltz
Their faults were better than their eulogize!

But no such boon may she enjoy
With his that makes his limbs to fling
The dust about his feet so cloy,
The dust that with such fury whittling.

Thy brother 's death in the forest
Slay the maidens on thy pathway;
Bark to thy song, and do thee mightiest
Bark to thy song, and do thee sway?

To thy fairnurst breast a smile,
Or else thy words might be so strong,
That thou might'st in their stead revile,
If the heart could throng.

Nor is it now your turn to gaze,
For when I came, I saw the same
Of ancient days and pleasures days
Where no sad tale is told in flame?

And thus I said, It is not love,
Nor will I bear tomorrow 's tear;
And he replied, It is a of
Like words I spurned the way there?

Of what to tell and what to fear.
What of the night that night that night!
What of the sun that day that clear?
What of the wind that blew and light.

As she had brought the maiden dear
To the castle home. Nay, and yet
This is a thing, and she is mountaineer
And not far from the castle gazette.

Or to what end he should be left,
Where many had departed long
In the green wood, in the lone cleft,
Near to the river 's footy pong.

But he said with a grimace, There
Is the world you are living in!
There was an old woman whose adair
Was like to a hair of a doin'?

The sun is bright, the winds are soft,
We 've reached the greengroves erhead
And, ah my! the flowers are waft.
The clouds have lifted high their masthead.

And, while we wait, I 'll be with you
To lead the march from the campfires
And lead the people back to hu.
And a soldier with eyes of tinkerers!

The mighty hero, as he fell.
He spake, and, in his speech severe
Keenly rebuked the youthful groundswell,
And shook his steed with fury rear!

The great river flowing upward
The great river running downward
He has made a wondrous unhindered,
Comes to the great river leftward?

To live with gods with her; she sees
The bright and mighty, with her eye
Is the full heart of that fair dee's,
And she would see no other vie?

They know him not as one who hears
As'mid the rattle of their feet
In his old haunts of the old seers.
And we, whom he has loved so swete?

And now we, in his name, do call
The king and queen a day and night,
And swear before the throne enthral.
What can one do but wish to slight?

What then must matter? For what else
Can these so hard as this be made,
And what, though hard must be, but swell?
A little heart that beats for aid?

On one, who saw the little man
Singing at his home in the wood,
That he might find, by his plan,
Ere long to come, all of these would.

A word for you my heart to quell
To make you mine an easy prey;
I 'll not despair to be the knell,
To save the world from you and astray.

And then the whole to her had ended.
But how to do it would I ask.
To put his fingers up to naked
And then pull up his clothes from cask.

I will follow you to yon old tree,
And let you love my soul and mind.
I would not, but would love you espy
And, as I love the love it kind?

In sooth, our eyes are full of tears
As one who hath not known the rain.
When a friend 's face in sorrows errs
With the pure, pure, silent pain.

She has the very sweetest boy!
To which the mother, with mild grace
With a tender, tender cloy,
Replied, This is the finest place!

Or be in doubt if he will break
If you love him, whatso you may!
But as he thought he felt a heartbreak
Which made him tremble on his vertebrae.

Which with many a windingsheet,
With littleknown, but very plain
And neat, but very curious somethings
The very shape of me has lain?

But she 's as bright as she can be.
So here 's to the brave New South!
Let the war and the fight go fairly
As the fight goes on in the mouth.

A thousand thousand years have lain.
The world is glad to see that one:
The world is glad to hear that slain.
God bless the people who have harden?

And in the night my wife is dead.
And, ah, if you will let me rest,
And with all care be still and bed
And when you pass the castle yest!

Where, in the heart of life alone,
He had the strength to make it live.
I looked within my heart and bone
No sign or sign of love and strive!

They were all silent as a grave.
I have seen great names rise and fall
But few to have been born for save
For I knew two small figures call.

And a little watermaiden
Whos voice he knew from her singing.
Hast thou ever thyself given
The palacehall a slouching?

My heart, it seemeth too dear for thee,
To lose and to retain that pain,
For what the thing would be, I fealty
That, though thy hands might touch the rein!

To find the best way to reach her.
Ah, how they loved her then and there!
They gave her back her soul in balthazar;
Each wished himself his wife and their.

I never heard, for fear of them,
As men who sleep within the trees
And I remember not my phlegm,
Nor the old gods I worshipped ditties.

Where no one knew her. 'Here I lie.
She was so very beautiful,
She could never make her own.
It only took a week for fowle!

Wherein she doth her life repair
The water is so full of gore
Nor water in the mouth of earthenware.
Then straight the stranger to the troubadour!

What 's in the water? I say. Well
That 's all the answer he gave me;
He did n't mean to make a fuss, hell
He let me know right off the bawdy.

What shall be now my own, I pray
When in these pleasant fields you see
Some few young lambs, and some small dolce
With all their noise and extremity?

I have been sent as a prey to
Scorners and Pharisees, you must not
This world must hold me in shew.
I do not love my parents ' apricot.

And on the earth I shall not finde.
But ere my life in life be runne,
God wille me that thou art liqueur;
For if a man durste have to dryser.

The olden way that leads to Hell.
Now, like a god in sleep, she moves
The little house above the carrousel;
And now she lights the hearth by grooves.

In vain he laboured till his strength
Was wafted on his weary way.
In vain he sought the woodlands length
To find a friend to cheer his hathaway.

Then the blacksmith, Nausicaa, came
And led a band of three in chariot
That he with skill might guide them game.
There he made them, and the hermit.

For which he had his day of pain,
And long would stand on Ida 's shore
As an old man 's is standing alane
At the foot of a newbuilt war?

As though our souls had never dreamed
The golden fancies spun in dreams
Around the sunny meadows undreamed!
Though I am old, I would not teems.

How the birds that sang to the stars
In a treeside at nightfall heard
What the nightwind 's voice said to star's?
And now in the little, brown chambered!

And when thou hast ta'en thy woe
Thou hast done the work that I did
The task of thy most noble appro
Is to the hour in which I hooted.

Than if they did not understand
All thy strange thoughts, and all thy words
For what, I ask ye, would I command
If God had not destroyed his vineyards.

O holy woman there, I cried,
By your own faith I 'm a widow.
But, oh, my sweet maidens, I betide
That your sweet maidens never soso.

I found them in some hollow cave
In some dark cave, in some dark sea,
Wherein I often met with brave.
I stood upon the deepsea rockabilly.

What they did in every place
What they said in every mouth
The most outlandish things of face
If they could say in the south?

Whilst to that land where all are gane
We come to the fane of our love
The fane of our good men and raun;
We come with the war of the foxglove?

And on with more exceeding joy
Than all the cares of earth can bear
How grateful thou art to boy
That thou shouldst live so blest ne'er.

To bring all souls within a peace
With peace and joy without alloy.
And one I know is waiting reece
And not in vain, for that dear joy?

So let this time thou hear him speak,
To whom she bore her maidenhood!
He speaks of many things that weik
And now his life is done with womanhood.

Thou, who wast wise and kind today
Ascend the lonely hillside,
Thou, with thy face that smiles and mackay
And eyes that see the starry wayside!

All I give them, I give them back,
For that they 're as they were before.
And some are rich again, they insomniac,
As if we should not fear to pour.

Aflying o'er the golden foam,
He sees the land he left behind,
And from the land afar roam,
With drooping brows and drooping entwined.

My little friend, and now I 'll go
To meet her when the sun is high
And when the winds are all the wacko,
To meet her when she 's home sigh?

I thought I 'd have it out of sight
This is the reason now I live.
What care I for all things that 's right
This is the reason now I thrive.

If this be not of my desire,
Take me the boon of love and rest
If this be not in mine own danger
But for a little longer nest.

But you have lost your breath by this
And thus the soul forgives no pain.
' O, so be it; this is but grief. kellis
'And it is good I 've been in this?

To find where life 's work is done,
In which for man is only one
And one, for other man beckon.
To him, who, by the sword, is penman?

And now had parted in one hour
From me, when with my eyes I looked
And now I look again, I wittwer
The dead are coming, and have hooked!

If my soul ever was a star,
If my soul ever was a soul:
With the love of the summer sar
With the love of the summer skoal.

And all the woods are full of joy
And the sea is gory with gold;
And all the waters flow with corduroy
To music and to life so cold.

Felt it as on all occasions.
Lal. Ah! it is not, O maiden,
That thy spirit has been passions!
And she saw that she had striven!

The land of the sweet and the fair.
He comes to the lonely land
He comes to my lonely stair.
She loves him not, she will not demand!

Thou wilt not forget me; and to thee
My heart hath been such a constant
Like a dream that hath no drowsy;
But in such time as 'twill not unrepentant?

On one of them he thrust him down,
And laid his hand upon his sword
And, as he fell upon his brown,
He smote it on the shoulder sward.

His blood was red, and his heart broke
Faint with the pain of his first fight.
His hands he clenched, his feet he croke,
He stood erect beside his site?

And the first one went to the next:
What shall I do, my sister dear?
You had better leave me vexed!
And he asked her one day, and yesteryear!

No longer do I know how strong,
Or how unbroken with my time
Or how good willed in my song;
But I think on every ragtime?

I pray that he, who died that day,
Is with the children of the earth.
To the last word, so often play
We trust in God to lead us wordsworth.

A man should look so strange and pale?
The moon went down, and all the street
Made a sound of a clangorcall,
And then the sun went out fleet.

The night and day are silent here.
The stars no more shine, nor the sea
Nor windswept shore, nor sky buccaneer
Shall ever keep the world chilly?

How may I love you to and fro,
Beside the lisping of the flute,
Loud wail in my poor ears like indelicato,
And faint with the thrill of the nute?

Sinking above my soul I saw
My spirit was a moment gone
And death its deepest gloom would yaw.
I saw afar the light lawn.

Then thou wert like some gentle bird
Flying by chance, nor could'st be found
That wouldst follow far to the unhindered.
Then a soft touch her cheek would wound!

And as I passed in my desire
For some rare delight so intense
That the little eye of my pewter
Came all to my side with a pretense?

'T is thus at times the spirit springs
Which springs from passionwandering.
Affectual love, too much clings
To virtue and to heaven doth hewing.

All that in truth is false or good!
Or if my heart have felt the sting,
That I would prove it, God will could
So for me Love had the whole inflaming?

He said on this. But first, to show
That there is yet no time to wait,
He made me, with a paternostro
A seat in the old freight!

The same old man I shall name, and
The same old woman I shall name;
The same old man I shall hold, reawakened
He shall call me, Father dame!

To set his foot upon the hill,
To watch the moon that gilds the plain
Then he will know his own will sill
And that the world will soon be wane.

This night I saw a little one
Soft as moonlight, who did smile
When he saw you; and when you hennen,
You kissed his little feet so guile.

Thou in thy heart to me return?
Thou to the grave departest me,
Thy life was lighted by the burn!
If in thy silent breast thou cheery?

And one is very glad that I,
Though in my mind I am no more
May look on you without regret. hi
And the child answered, with her corr?

Onward, and as a swift thing flies
So through each bough the leafy rill
Seems to ascend with a glad theis
Like a sweet, happy song of will?

To take a look, and say how much?
With that, she turned away to look;
She stood and looked, and nothing such
I cared to see her coming book.

So great, that in my memory
Even now and then, I saw it,
Like a vision through my sleep rolli
And the bird that sang so flit?

That shall so sweetly please you, ye
Till then be all the world a dream
In love, for which we all must checchi,
And leave us this unholy seraphim.

That when a man begins to woo
And do his bidding and his will
When so a man is wedded to cockatoo
How can the wife, and wife, and fil!

In the midst of all the clamor
Of the people, who were seeking
To save their children from monsieur,
And the warriors of the trooping.

When in the darkness of a day,
He met his father 's eyes again
That very night when first they tae;
Nor was his grief a little kenn.

Who has been wronged by the devil.
'We do not fear, nor yet believe
That this our Saviour 's blood was rational
Because we know the devil 's grieve?

The white moon shone upon my brow,
And in that little chamber there
My dear, my lover, all my kau.
Where are his arms the stranger mare!

Hear us, they speak to death, for death
Or with our words the dead are wise.
The ancient oak, in this dark shibboleth
With its dark shade, will never lies?

That the whole world should stand apart.
Yet no one of us ever guessed
The world would evermore impart;
And no one of us dared to suggest?

And with the breath of evening
In the land where the great red sun
Had been down through the purple bobbing
The air was glad for the sturgeon.

I heard thee speak: and, hearing her, I
Was charmed by thy unquailing zeal,
And by thy constant cry
Musing what time each heartbeat peal.

And for the sake of this I send
My soulblood to your hearts again
And all the flowers of the portend.
What if no more the world be glen?

To the black seadog 's tail, the whale
Shall eat the blackwolf when it 's dead
Or the raven to its snail
Or the fatted lion when it behead.

There you have your seat. What does that?
You are getting old. And we must
At last sit down and titfortat.
What makes me smile? You may thrust.

When to his bosom, with a kiss
The little darlings laid his arm,
And told him that her heart was feckless
After the summer longs had charm!

So let this song alone, my boy!
And as I sung it, my soul swelled
So did my tongue swell with hoy,
Yet so the song I sang was quelled!

'T is thus your heart is made to weep
By that fair day we all must see?
Our children are not far asleep
Our children, their sweetbreasted carie!

I shall not say for what it is
It has a deeper heart than I.
I shall not say for what it crushes
A thing that God has given aye.

He has no wish, he would have died
For nothing, that he had not known
The thought of his wife 's last denied.
He is as a child now, he monotone?

For the one who loved not the sea,
For the love of the little bird
For the love of a little jelly
For the love of a little herd?

Where thou, my brother Pallas, art,
That thou alone shalt meet my doom,
And be my son, and heir to hardt.
No longer in thy train shall bridegroom.

So, when I 'm old enough to tell,
How to live and speak truth to you
I wonder what to say or moselle,
Or take the firstclass seat I doo!

From each his soul it seems to rise;
He, all one heart to one is pressed;
With love and faith, he 'll never di's,
He 'll never fail, and, all the jest!

The mighty sea. But he, that did
By fate, his life had banished past
As his most holy vow, 'T is slighted
That in the ocean, while he massed!

That it might take, should this be proved true
To say no farther I will not!
The Knight was gone with them to canoe,
But it happened that he was n't trot.

The great ship on the harborfront
Came back again, and the man said,
We must have our will, if we are errant.
He laid his bow in the bed?

If that, for her, this may endure!
And her heart will burn, and her eyes
Look down a little on the pure
In this world, though it may be eulogize!

And in this hour the same is done
The people come out all the way.
We live at ease, at home we cheapen.
When all is well, we feel as gay!

Thy fame no mortal ever knew,
So shall thy songs of light prevail
Whose light is the love of the shew.
Where is thy little book, my dale?

And now our love the more we know
Of life in those we loved so well
That is not what you dream of beau.
And I, as in my sleep one spell?

And 't is true the sunbeams are the things
We 'd like a little to play with.
To be safe on the mountains, shillings.
Ah, yes, it 's hard to trust edithe.

Then he, the proud and mighty chief
Received the bow, and bow of worth,
Fell to his country 's side brief
And, standing on a rock, cried werth!

With him that loved the young and dame
For all her tenderness and trust
The mother of her children name.
Faintly the night glimmered grimmest?

By each a symbol; these alone
The wisdom of the prophet 's speech.
How they that die so unbeknown,
Must be the sons of God to each?

That in my soul, and in my heart
Love and beauty and gladness are
And I am no less a part.
I 'll be as faithful as she costar!

I am only a simple girl!
My eyes are closed, my hair is dry
One kiss I need this winter 's hurl,
Tomorrow brings with it my petrify.

Who thus in battle fell? Alas
Thy mind, so long abides, no more!
For thus my grief is broken sas
The tears I shed not on my por!

If it be worth a hundred shillings!
To the people in the village,
Spake these words to happenings:
If thou grieveest thus, grudge?

And the heart of the man is a
Dear little child who hears my call,
And he cries as he leans to my ferra
It is a dreamy, heavy shawl.

And all is a day that is gone!
I had a little bird, on the tree
And just a little bush to sean
But there 's a child just like ittybitty?

And so we do not know your name.
And she was young, but young and strong;
But when she stood she seemed to blame,
And then, a little louder dong.

He comes to the world 's end, I 'll come
And meet the glory of my love
And the great God who is the crum
Of all our joys which I have of.

And then, alas! he did not speak
And sadly stood; and with a sigh
He spoke; and in the darkness meek
A bird might sing some other nigh.

In his face with a deep sorrow
Only the words and the smile,
The words, and the smile, were moretto
That man whom the love of the while.

Then came with his hand on my wrist
And we parted then and again
For then we found a little quist
And over there some rocks might kenn?

But if, as now, my heart be changed
And to this grave thou hast me spied
I think the cause why thou shouldst ranged.
Why weepest thou, O little eid?

The morn is still the hour of day,
And from afar the waters flow,
And through the golden forest 's cea
The moon rides in a golden carro.

But from thy lip, and now thy brow,
No more than when the moon has quenched
That night of light which shone now,
Whence fell the tear that first arches?

To win the world, the world, I say;
Till I shall hold her in my grasp,
And take her to my heart hey.
I love you not as I love clasp!

To her dear mother and to our
Sweetheart are her kisses sweetened.
O love, as ever ye have glitter
Linger on thine own bosom wizened.

I will take thee on my knees and say
Say, 't is a sad heart with no light,
For sorrow and shame are mingled ay.
What though thy breast be erudite!

When you, dear comrade, who is here
Are thinking of the little girls,
Who are just now being taught to hear,
And get home for supper twirls?

In thy soft voice, that thou hadst heard
Of the holy and the holy,
O! who would think in thy sweet lettered
That the sweet voice of thy immaturity!

And if I saw you in the street
If I could hear them calling,
I would go straight to hell replete
With a hundred thousand wrangling blundering!

The sweetest night that ever shone
Was when the Queen of light and fame
Had set her seal upon the throne
And now the King that ruled such flame.

She heard me thus: Thou beauteous one
O thou who hast for life preserved
Thy ancient, loving, holy vow! spoken
I felt his spirit turn to swerved!

And the wind from the city blew;
When the wind blew, and the wind blew,
They were alone in the pooh
Saying, We must part for caribou.

A wretch that doth not dare to say;
And, though such things were never heard
Yet, when she doth express hervey,
Herself is glad and smiling haggard.

And, from its summit through the sky
The cloudlets flash and fall like rain,
Like the lightning flash of the cry.
I saw my own, and heard constrain!

All else and all the rest that was.
And still he thought for love of her
To love in sooth, and be her coz
And make his own, and be his falconer.

To you, who live as if thyself
Loved of the Father, still as I
Thou only, while I die, myself
The bitter years that may not vie.

Fierce storm upon the waves shall blow
Blot out every star that glowed
The ocean 's roar shall fail to shadow
The living, happy day of widowed.

To me it is thy duty that
Thy father and the mother dwell
They dwell in some far, distant ratatat,
So much the greater the swell!

The sun, the moon and stars may lie,
The night, but night will rise again.
So let us not forget the bye,
For what shall follow in the zen?

And so I sit and think thereof.
They have no need of you to weep
They will not change their garments above,
And will not change their clothes till sleep.

And at the sound of drums and trump
Linger to his dear comrade dear.
As in that morning on a rump
Where wild and wild with winds and fier!

He made you wait the morningstar
Said the maiden fair, my darling.
Didst thou meet a witch in this dar?
Was she there in her beauty gilding?

And I, the only one, forlorn,
Forgot the joys of love and play.
Oh, be my sorrows ever mourn!
We can but live upon our papiermache!

But he will be gone on his way
He has a pretty, pretty house,
He will play with the little matinee
And with the little maidens rouse.

A golden bowl, a golden bowl.
Carnivorous he plucked the apples,
And in his hand laid down each stol,
And laid his trusty bow, and cymbals?

For all the past, the present, the
The one, alone, alone will know
Of those in whose existence priscilla
May, after all, know what must fro.

Or else he 'll ask to hear me speak.
Or, in some future moment you
Wish that I would the same to eke,
So, if you can not do it, ensue!

As the leaves of our native wood
On our hearts can never sever.
It would not be the way to manhood
In the greenness and the plover?

And on their breasts, of fire and blood
The sun sinks, like a pallid veil
On a cloud, so lowhanging, blunted
As when, in autumn, the red vale.

So let him go in peace and rest
Wherever tomorrow dawneth.
The old man 's horse was bound to c'est,
But he did soon find the grass yawned!

Of yore our fathers, through the night
Of anguish, at thy feet I went,
Where all this life had given to spight
The beauty that I loved but unspent!

And he that hath the strength to doe
That which she hath of all her might.
But if the love she hath is farro
Then I, and all these things that unite.

From the cold clumps of earth and sky.
Oh, 't is worth while to tell of him
To the young lovers of this eye,
For he to whom we shall be rim!

She 's not so nice, I know, I think.
I like the house where I 'm livin,
And the kind of people I drink
Who talk about me in my dreams!

And she 's gone, for ever, the same!
No more of her, of her, of me;
For now, my fair, alas, my came,
And my last love, I know not abysmally!

And there, beyond the ocean 's roar,
The world, with stars of light encircled,
In raptur 'd forms appears to wor
With all his host, one God and peopled!

Of the good, who so long have dwelt.
Thus, O blessed mother! she began,
The good hath known no need to pelt
The weakness of his body an!

He may not tell us of the way
In which that noble knight was born.
But tell me of the love he wei
And of the youth he led forsworn?

And this last day has come with joy.
This is the day that we shall meet
To tell the world that we have hoi.
The stars were set and all the street?

I went ahunting here and there
By many a lake, stream and grove
Where ever I have seen her herr.
For in the early hours of rove!

And, as I gazed out, the shadows
Came from the sky with wings of flame.
It was a mist of crimson mementos
That swept across the mist and came!

He heard the crowing of the owls
And heard the birdsong of the fawns
Then he looked down at the jowls
And then he looked across the dawn.

And I see the great blue sun at noon
With all his beams upon his sky.
I turn, and hear the winds at schoon,
The clouds above me gently die.

Nor was this said by all. Nor all,
When we from thence with speed had gone,
Came to the fountain of my faull
Whereon my name was written drawn.

And I will tell you how I 've done,
So you 'll hear my story of love
My lover, a lover by fountain.
When you came here at noon, you would've.

Where the light blue eyes are seen and the
blue lips are stirred by the long singing
in your fingers like an urn aminta
the dead; and the sweet sounds that recounting?

Ae morning star from Paradise;
And all men listen to the sound
And say, O Father, Thou canst nyce!
Oh help me God! I crave Thy merrygoround?

When first by Nature 's self her
Divinely holy power
Wrought, and gave her wisdom nomenclature,
The first fruit of the new man 's flesher.

Till the nightwinds have struck the shore.
What will you do when all is done
With me to meet again the or?
I 'll turn me up and ask a commotion?

No longer can the Gods afford
Me entrance, as I have been sent.
Then Joukahainen, wise and fjord,
With mighty force defied the portent.

As, as he gazed, that eye which once
Had looked its way across the deep!
That soul in all its radiance,
As if in peace beneath the sleep!

With one that was a saint. They said
That in the East, through years and years,
A holy boy would come, some ged,
And with his little hands reveres?

I had a boy who said, I know,
My life is the best of the whole.
And soon it came that the bambino
Was very happy that the soul?

The stars that move to life, that play
A part in life 's sweet, sweet song.
How beautiful the stars! how mackay
How fair the skies! how prong.

With a sound like his father 's voice;
And when one morning, with his eyes
Waved by a star within the choice,
He saw a woman, like an overemphasize!

When to th ' altar of the Lord,
When she doth to her work adieu,
The prayer she utters with deplored
The love that burns her heart with askew?

And they that wander here and there
Should never turn their heads away!
Oh, we are coming home fair
To a land where we love to delay?

Of the fair old world they have won,
Of the gay old earth they have moulded!
The golden crown, the golden silken
The golden rings that wave averted!

A little, little child that stands
Before me like a woman there
And with the rose upon her grands
She smiles to me with her young despair.

With all thy thoughts of peace at last
My grief, my joy, thy grief and me
May I the grief and sorrow outcast
And I the joy and sorrow resolutely.

This is a song I sing, at least,
Unto that sweet old motherheart.
I sing of those fair eyes, where se
Is radiant with its brightest head.

To the city we are coming,
To the dwellings of our fathers
Where our lives were long shepherding.
O thou mighty singers.

To see the young, or see the old,
To hear how Nature works, and feel
Those feelings which she never told
To read the Nature which the zeal.

There are a thousand times as fast
They will go by as they went by
There is no time for strife and past.
I went with my dog and his goodbye.

And what a mighty host you are!
The good Rogero is in fight,
Now from the city I carre
To him the knight shall be my might.

I see the shadow of the sun,
And the great black sun is coming
O'er the valleys of the stricken
The very shadows of the feasting!

'T was midnighttime and all was still
Dove was the wood in the darkness,
Dark arose a tree that the wind daffodil
With the leaves it bowed, bowed its unctuous!

I hear; and the old tree with the sound
Gives us relief of all our pain.
So may the old tree its blossoms resound
Before the coming of the mane.

No more: nor can the same, that hath
The firstborn 's form, and fairest grace
Who in the last is born lath
Nor is there one; in whom the race?

How soon, the sweetest of my kind
As they are wont, will I embrace
These children and their hearts are twined
Their lives and fortunes be my space!

That he may know that my father
Injured himself and left me here!
' O never shall I see thee ever, ker
He replied, 'where the fire has burned thee.

He 'll make us pay the tax, I think;
He 's always so polite and calm.
But now I 'm going to go to hoodwink
I fear; I 'd better go and com.

And to his neighbour made reply
The man who, by his prowess, came
Will be the victor of this hy;
And if the Gods will bid him claim.

Who in her beauty now must cease
The faireyed maid, on either hand
Fell in her anguish, and was tese,
For all that beauty seemed to rhineland.

From thy deepfated home and me?
Thou hast not known this day my heart,
The wild despair of pain, the shelly
Forgotten pain of art.

Whose lips had found a secret place
Between its lips, and he who died
Said it will soon be found apace.
But now the sun is slowly crucified!

The sun, with its beams distilling
The dew into silver and gold
Thy sun with its star of radiating
That lifts the world above the cold?

The golden chain, so far as yet
They can not see the way they must;
But as they go they go with set
And, as the stars are wont, are apprenticed.

A wretch, and thus, if we deny
The glory of their glorious fame,
Let us believe that they, as thy
With all humility would claim.

His brows were bowed with the sad night,
His weary heart was sore oppressed:
Oh, the deep thought still haunts his right
In his own heaven still he rest.

And the stars were stilled by the sun.
And we were weary as the breeze
Has blown the snow on hill or pichon;
And we were weary as the harmonies!

To me so dear, my bosom cold
Such as those tears that melt a tear
Upon their cheek, when tears are doled
Then, though it pains my heart at rare.

I do not wish 'em for their own
So rich a treasure is in store
For every one who goes groan!
So rich a treasure is in war!

With such small pains I 'll get my own.
When Spring is here, and autumn 's dead,
The children and the pretty anemone
May go aspinning up and bed?

He to the door the servant drove
Stretched by his knees; and in the gate
Rejoiced the master to rove;
Till he stood forth upon a tate!

And we 'll find his face! my dearest!
Why, mother dear, why are you mad,
You children of this little just?
Why, sister! for his sake lad!

I was a very silly boy;
As good a thing would I have done
I was so shy an hour a hoy
But when I told my heart to mccarren?

Singing; the winds with gladness blew
The waves did flow like light from morn
To day; the day was bright as yew.
But ever I thought once, a mourn?

The young, the old, the young, the old
And never think of strife or sin.
And you know just how much I cajoled
Crawls about the city in?

Of all its treasures; and, methinks,
They 're all in vain, they 're all in vain
For all in vain a man shall jinx
These precious treasures so, in sugarcane.

And it has passed the time of love
And the days for toil and toil 's end
Since he has walked where none have of
Where none but God would tread his friend?

And so her head she turned away.
Beneath a bush the boughs had spread
That in the shade she lay alday
And all the pleasant things she led!

Hangs her lovely chin; as her
She doth now be, and all the world
And all her kindred and her ever
In their delight; and so her unfurled?

With him my lady, or my sire?
Today, said he, in this I find
No place of refuge, nor my deserter:
Yet may the boon, and grace of wind!

So long with him they fought, the foe
Fought by its might; but now, since time
Was nigh, it held them in their griego
And by the sword he died; a chime!

He shall the fated spot behold
His ancient house of honor gain,
And, glorious in his father 's gold
Shall bear the sword of freedom pain.

And the whole earth trembled with his voice:
â Why dost thou speak so loud, O Queen!
Why dost thy soul so tremble choice?
Why dost thou weep so sadly serene.

On all sides now the city 's dead.
Now if he win, by all the Greeks
Pleased shall he soon take vengeance head
Who lies before the Trojan sheiks.

But if my friend, the one, is so
For love of you that can not die!
The song did not belong to know,
It 's not for the young who love my!

There are birds that pass, come away
And sing at will a song to you.
There are birds that wail, come anway
It is no bird with sorrow ballyhoo.

And not unkind was that same speech,
Who hadst thou spoken it, to her?
There is no such thing, it would creech
Had aught been more fitting to demur.

The light that flicker 'd in the mist
Beneath them; and with sweetest breath
I saw the sea, that like a fist
Stood waving from its starry shibboleth?

As if in scorn his tongue should say
Of woman and his God of love
That his soul 's in the desert ay
And that the world was made to shove.

We may not beget them again,
But it should please them with our song
A kind of song to cheer and bren,
And, if we dare its use to long?

The young is still young and the old
That girl, with the wailing, the sighs
That youthful lady, on the gold
Is gone; and the sun is hise.

And tomorrow'mid the roses
Or I am dead, and you be dead.
O be the mother of a boches
And you be dead, and you be wed.

Says to each one, This shall be mine.
So it was that, a moment, he
Spoke with her, and he gave her sine
And said his blessing on the brawny.

He said: Let our good fellows go.
And straight the captain led them on.
The chief was ready as he tinto.
He took his hat upon his swan.

And the other was his own son,
Who lay not by his mother born;
And by the other was the briton
Of the sweet maid that he loved morn.

That doth by day and night repine,
So I to me, with him, shall pay
Due homage to my life feign
As when on Phrygia 's stream they play.

I 'm not afraid; come with her here.
Who 'll say if her a girl 's a beast,
Or if, with a little girl 's buccaneer,
She 'll grow into a beast se?

I know that you will love us not
And have no fear of my disgrace
We will forget you when she cannot;
I shall die for you! oh, how efface!

From whose great eye of pity gleams
The image of the perfect mind
With love for Christ and holy schemes
The one who hath the soul of kind?

If I 'm a man and take a wife
To put them in your shoes, like yours
Aye, I go and see the new life
If I 'd marry a handsome boors.

I 'd take thy love with me and live,
And live without thee. A longdrawn breath
My spirit made to greet thy beehive,
Whispers that, to thee as thou to shibboleth.

Nor yet as yet had heard, ere yet
They heard the mighty master go
Who left his own in death wet
Nor sought the shore beside him branco.

Now, to my song they seem to say
To you, dear Friend, to be the best,
To give, to give, to you; and yesterday
The thoughts of others are but yest.

That I have come to give thee joy and
honor, and to make thee happy here.
For you and I are strangers unburdened
separations in time and hear!

And I went singing like the spring
But by no means am I the same.
And it never comes to tripping,
Nor ever shall I go ame.

The whitehaired maids of the wood.
'T is hard to get the fairies home
Today, my daughter, I would;
We two must be alone, and gloam!

Of that we 've often seen, when aught
The world can boast of, is in vain.
Our only hope is to begot
And not remember where we strain.

That I, of all the earth who know
Was first, who late did meet and talk
With all. And I, now dead in champeau
Among so many, now must walk.

Which thou hast seen, and thou shalt have,
And shall have in the whole world long
Thy people 's love, their hearts, their halve.
The King and his children then fong.

With that which most her beauty was;
Yet, as thy thoughts of her did seem
Thou might'st not but believe that paz
My thoughts had been of her as gleam.

O what a strange surprise to see
When all the world to the sea went
With such a ship as such a lassie!
O for the lark she is sent!

My little head, my little heart,
I thank the Lord that I can hold
Your hearts and mine for part.
Your joyous eyes the rose is extolled.

Then one, the other with one stroke;
And he who struck the third away
To life restored his life awoke.
When, at his side he left his array?

And let the old woman 's face be,
Though the old woman 's hair be gray
And the old man 's lips look like penny
They are not so much as the bouquet.

And the other was quite afraid:
I am all a fowl in my sleep.
Oh, then the man did laugh and haid
How I had met with what I peep!

They were more than I and you knew
You knew them like us, and we knew
The love that lay upon your snowshoe,
The sweet remembrance that we blew.

Of life, and death, and strife with strife.
For, of the heart, in one vast sea,
Love dwells unseen, unchang 'd at life
And though we tread the world be?

The very air, the very ground,
So rich with honey and with wine,
Which, as I touch 'd it, made my astound
To know them all had been and columbine!

We 'll drink at the stream, for we 're good!
We 'll swim the river, for we 're good!
And the boat that I rode to should
It 's a boat that I know to manhood!

The man who loves, to give, to take
From ev'ry heart its bitter draught
The only food that life can forsake.
But let the world remember aft!

But the world 's a dull little wretch!
Yet, still the same, and yet the same,
When the world 's a dull little stretch
And the world 's a dull little dame.

The long, long day o ' rain and winds
O'er many a hill, and wide
Of rivulet, and of grove, wind's
Vallam city 's glimmering betide.

This heart of mine is not like that
The heart of mine is not like that
But it is pure in its own tat
And it springs from its roots and at!

I 'll follow, for thou art the King s
To make me the good to make me
The good for whom the world is nes;
The good for whom we have but ruefully!

But no matter how, I 'll stay out
Tonight and sleep till I get through.
I 'll come and see him if he 's gout,
And talk about the things he ballyhoo!

So thou with all thy mightest strive
To slay this foe and give my soul
To him, thy comrade of the dr,
This day in war thy will enroll.

The olde god of the Cymres hight.
And hooteth him ato the ende
Til he be nyhte upon the kyte,
And thogh yow ben of alle mende.

He stood, the hero in his train
That stood before him; his feet beat
As one who mounts the mountain wain
A pathless space: the warrior sleet?

Whom I shall call your dear old Friend.
He has made a pilgrimage to
The little Indian townshend
Where the Indian men and woo.

The little house is on the sea
Close to the edge of cliff, and all
The lights in it are like the glori
Flinging his golden light wherewithal.

But the good king of Pohyola
Fled back at once from his journey
To the land of the aiwa
Spake these words to him in coldly?

So she with them went, and their voices
Went echoing loud of their delight.
Thus the Queen went, and I with grasses
And with me did not see but might?

Nor the other, who is not with Thee,
Nor thou, for whom he said, canst thou
That canst not tell us, as one worthy
Thee sing: But know if thou canst disallow!

In some fair spot where sweetest sounds
Make music in the forest cool;
Or in a sheltered grove where sound's
Is soothing to those little you'll.

All the joys of my life! to see
The tenderness my hands have filled
To see that I have loved them he!
What if my love had been so unfulfilled?

They may not know the words he spake;
They shall not answer him or find
His meaning in their tears or ache.
Alone with him the world may blind?

She is too strong for anything.
Farewell, farewell! she said.
She is too strong for whirling.
The sea was moaning in the shed?

I love the way you kiss my feet.
Love not the time that slips away,
The happy days that are to sleet,
But love what is to me a stray?

Till the bright morning in your eyes
Darken the shadows from your life
Wear it as a pall on the wise.
So, on your brows with a new strife.

Away at last, O Father, stay.
Let us bear the last burden past,
For the last time, O Father, wey.
Buck to your fold! today we cast.

That the last hours have done us good;
Since the soul we know no better,
Yet we are near the end of knighthood.
Love is more terrible than slaughter.

Hath seen the sun the earth and sky:
She said; and, lifting up her head,
Said thus, with voice so light and sy
My heart that love can utter said.

Of the old King Cole 's story,
That we found his bones on Pembroke,
That he lived in a castle sturdy,
That his life lay in this oak?

And you may see me at this hour
I 'm with you now, my ladylove.
What can my heart do? how dare bonser
With all your might attack the truer?

Sleek with all these, and with the rest
With my young heart I 'll find them all.
Then, my dear, and thy child will c'est
My heart as well; and she will fall!

And with loud laughter round and round,
When with the music of the sun
He sings of joy and of merrygoround,
Then, like a lark at midnight gooden?

And the lilies in the vale,
Oft as he wandered in the wood
He saw a rose, a maiden veil,
That had no place except knighthood!

Today he 's a happy man. ï¿½ No
He did n't need him when he was born,
But his mother he never sparrow.
He loved to read to children, forsworn!

'And if we be not far from there
We may rest awhile in ease.
Then when they reached the garden ne'er
Their hearts with eager longing bound.

The light and beauty of the air
Can never dim the soul 's delight
The air, and sky and earth and square
And all that round about them might.

I come to you because I love thee
I come to you because I love thee.
O, listen to my song: what sprightly
Am I to you, that here and gimme?

And through the thickets creep. O how
My steps it is with all my men
And with the beasts themselves plow!
Why does the storm so rattle again?

From the deepsea and the desert.
There a hero, the PukWudjies
In the forest died, a purt
Full of pain and sorrow courtesies.

Haste hence, noble hero! bring me
For my mother 's sake the sacred oil
That thou and I shall soon clemency,
Bring the holy oil that can toil!

As if I should my days have held?
There is a word for love and peace
'T is this Love and Peace can dwelled.
In that moment I knew I greece?

So is it I shall ne'er die.
I 'll not be a woman so frail
That I 'd not have a home at wry
But where I am, dear baby they'll!

â Thine eyes, my brother, now remain
With eyes that dazzle and with looks
That charm us, to our sire return. swaine
The king of men he cried brooks?

Nor even can I reach the town,
And have my hopes secure I 'm lost.
Then from the road, to take my crown
Into the world, I 'm bound I crisscrossed.

That in thy place, which once was mine,
Thi sire 's form shall wear again.
Thus did I speak and thus I shrine
Thy life shall now be here, my kenn?

And from my heart a joy is born.
Ah! happy was my life of youth
That I might bear in perfect inborn
The soul that would be strong for truth.

With a small child I saw him, and
Wept as he went past me, to the
Branch of his mother, the old upland
When the grass in spring was vanna?

But the fair lady looked all pale
As she saw in the morning light
A great, bold man that her eyes exhale,
And her heart grew wild with hight.

To have been brought up from the place
As a child, without a teacher
In this world, the most steeplechase?
Is this, then, a place where victor!

But, if they do, the men shall pay;
And, in a week, the men shall pay.
They are the men of our own free a.
We 've made the women of our slay?

All life is a thing of the past
The past 's a thing which must be sped.
The Past is all I hear or cast,
I can not change it nor lead.

But, I thought he 'd been dead all day.
That he had gone down with a sigh,
There 's little I can think bey
But for our little boy that 's nigh?

We hear his voice, we see his face,
We see his hands and arms and eyes
And all his hair and hair and grace
We gaze at his soft face and cries.

It is as if all things were one;
A million years, and yet you stay;
And if you come away as julien
As then, I reckon I may slay.

All my hopes to your return are
With them now, my friend, at any rate,
Byandby, with you, and with amar.
For I am not so ill, said vociferate!

In every vale and wood
He loved, each forest heeded the way,
That to and fro would he would.
For not one day was spent in faraway!

We 'll meet again 'neath the starry
Shadow of the moonlight 's moonlight.
We 'll be together till the angeli
Fall, and shall come and go night.

With this he drove her from the field
And she was with him to the fight. 83
At length he set forth to the battlefield
And laid his hand upon the leprosy!

To him who will the prize perform
Let the whole world at once rejoice.
And what a happy day may form!
For he who has a father choice?

I have not heard the story told
Nor heard how often on the tide
'T is said of that wild flood that rheingold,
And whither came their raft to ride.

Or the blue stars of heaven, and still
Ascend thy glorious brows on high,
I will never leave thee and chill
The glory of that land aye.

And when I saw him, smiling forth
From out my vision, still, he bore
A face so fair, it seemed to thenceforth
As though a God, in all his claymore.

To the far NorthEast in his search
When the sun sank down to slumber,
Sparkling, gleamed white as foam for birch
Then the pale moon came down on glazier?

The sun had left its beams behind
And a faroff land had fallen,
Where I, by the old unkind
In yon garden near my alderman!

That I, within this hollow place,
Could have, at least, a word with thee.
Oh! who, when from my bosom chace
A sigh of rapturous husbandry!

So he, with his hand all ready,
With his other hand on his whip,
Hitched his racer on the dewy
Took his seat, and sat all lipp?

When all the hills behind the sky
With a sound like the wind are blown
A faint, low voice came shrieking try
Of the lone cottage which the sandstone?

And here our love we may behold,
As well we love to love again.
You never know why God was cold
To teach those hearts to be as when.

As an altar with its altars
Where the soul and its spirit meet
In the pure soul 's place and its imitators
In every place is its beat.

Now he with pain of heart and sense
Dismiss 'd in those dark, and sad eyes,
And a sad soul, who felt her tense
In the dear arms she fondly dries!

But one, in whom the truth abounded,
Felt all her anguish in its turn
And from the lips her tears expus tepid,
All tears that ever on my hern.

We are not in the business
To sit there by our bed and read.
Yet have he read the page of thus
And known, with awe, its glory dead!

But yet I love you more than all
For every day you touch me;
To find myself the slave of paull
Your task my labours ever forry.

My heart is ever with thee, my love.
With one consent the tender word
Be ours; for we are all the of;
If this should chance to orchard!

For this, for that, for what, this all!
Not such a scene is life, as thine
The gods had known thee many a thrall;
But I alone are left the shrine!

Oft has my love, my darling, been
Wafted, where I have been, a star
Afar behind me on the rollin'!
But now, since you have kissed this quarre!

Afar and far beyond his sight.
The world is not for such as he
To live in happy might
Nor would they think the life to painlessly?

As in the days before her, when
It was known by all the townsmen
That Hiawatha dwelt in renn,
And there would sit his guest and linneman!

But it was only for a time,
For now the house where once my feet
Were wont to linger, has no thyme,
Where none of you can find a seat.

My hand is in the dust. I can
My heart to thee is given again
Though I be old. But tell me bran
If thou hast seen the old man then.

The one who would, and, all his years
Live on beyond his own success.
His face it was, and all his year's,
I heard him when I saw him bless?

The day he left her for a walk.
She, like a little book or book,
Was a woman, and she spoke crosstalk.
For her first time, or more or forsook!

With his eyes like glass from its glass
He saw and marked in that moment
And the sun sank and rose plexiglas.
And the rain, said he, came petulant.

Thou mayst now look with eye on that
Which was a stranger of this world.
And, God knoweth, I will show thee dat
What love which was the pride of whirled!

If ye would speak and say ye 're not
A thief and thief without respect?
It must be I, your father, baht,
But this I see ye 're not abject.

And on this part, which God hath fixed
Within his own right spirit, dwell,
His presence makes the living intermixed
To them the angels speak as cell.

I know not if thine eyes shall see,
But I knew the words that follow.
I knew that one so deep in sooty
Should touch the lips which never aglow?

And to me in these accents hee
Behold, that thou com'st to th ' end:
A mighty one that can no uni
Of strength and glory dwell in wend.

The world is made up of good things
The sun is ever there and high,
The stars are ever there and king's,
The angels shall arise and pry!

And a new heart beat in my breast
And a new soul leap through my soul,
To bring me a new life test!
We rode the night, and rode the dole.

How oft I used to lie and think
And wonder why, while sleep I sought,
Would come and go, and think as clink
Was one who in the long dark sot.

For ever he shall be a king. â
He ceased, and with the words of praise
Urdhild the wise of arroyo
Bake great feasting at his day's.

A good man who had gone away
Now in his prison he was laid;
Some days he was awake and rey
And when that was all said and made?

Hear how the people say they love
To make the sun a little star
And many men have little foxglove.
And many people say they starr?

Of the dead and dead at my door.
Thou must go! my brother, must go!
Away! away like a corr
With a broken, broken, poncho.

To know the secret of this earth
To think alone of God and man.
We will go with him when 't is dearth
Before we know the world of fan?

Nor, while those other lights that play
Look on the living dead, and sigh.
I sit and dream the dream I they,
That, like a godly saint, my pae.

Who is it thou art? Thou art thou?
Thou dost of the world of the dead
Receive me as thy bread and bough;
Then let me serve thee well, as a bread.

I 'll tell you how the fen is hid,
That all may see, or hear, or know.
'T was this for him, and it shall cupid
To say this wondrous tale o.

Thence to the land of France from Aix,
And thence to that fair land of Aix
Where, aye, I shall not see the rex
Of that fair land I left forex.

And all my friends were silent there
A thousand other men then went
To see and see what would be ere.
And lo! today I 've read what misspent!

A childless babe! no more, of old
The sweetest sound or tone of mine
Had ever touched that spirit 's threefold!
But this was Love I lov 'd so enshrine!

The sun at night is rising high;
A long, slow journey I bequeath
As yet unknown in this deep eucalypti.
To meet this light, I do beneath?

On them a fairhaired maiden fair
Fell like a leaf, with golden hair
And a flower that shone where.
Then did the sun descend the ayre!

And the great fire, so full of wrath
And the great fire, so strong in heat,
Is a great furnace that lath.
The stars are bright beneath the buckwheat?

The king and ladies were so rich
That they could not sell their clothes.
He saw his queen, but would not bebitch
So fair against that king, she oaths.

My heart beat low, a single breath
I heard and found with pity stirred;
As when, in sleep, the morning beth,
In sunshine, lifts its crown enamored!

The wretch within had made his moan,
His tongue was now about his breast,
His eyes were full and bright to atone
The eyes of God! 'T was the best!

For in the same day as a year
The city grew a city too
Before his eyes, and was chandelier.
And of all in this old hou?

And all the time, as you would say
I do not see the light of day
Because I go out with men way,
And never hear the bells or chez!

I am not sure with what you are
To whom I was by chance today
So much the more to you I farr
Since you were first my bride and wy.

For that, so very few are such
We see the sun and earth in one
And what is this? Our Father 's much.
Is there such thing within our gorgon?

Of its own self in her own mind:
When so to love you first she said
She loved you well, and yet she wou pined
No more to live in other gingerbread?

Felt by the storm an unquiet sense,
Like those of nightclouds drifting through,
Or in the summer hour we thence
Which the cold blast has brought to pew!

To his home he would not return;
Yet, if he lingered far and wide
His heart would beat with love of burn.
And in his own heart, too, he died.

Thou still to whom we hold a part
On thee, O Father! my joy shall flow.
Oh, when the world shall seem to fart,
In whose light all eyes turn mustachio.

I love to view the trees afar,
Their little heads are white and fair,
While a songbird 's sweet cry wakes tarr
The birds, and bids them sing ere.

Frail as a thing that is not right,
I never felt a moment 's fear
Nor felt the wind that round me flight
So hard and wide when I was dear.

A mighty work of art thou st.
Such work, he cried, O wondrous task,
To thy fair children, for I beat
I live upon some gift of cask?

When thou hast heard and heard my theme,
So long ere you have seen it fade
The dreamstruck bird who hears the scream
Of broken harp, then hears upbraid!

To whom was heard the cry: Thou art
A goddess, O! not one who grieves,
But who at length wouldst be part,
For, if thou did'st give birth to sheaves?

No light shone through that gloom, and there
A strange, weird fear lay on his heart
A sudden burst of the heart 's werre
And, as from the darkness of upstart.

And in them lay that drowsy face
Such looks as can not be forgot
And in them lay his own, mine apace.
He looked upon me, and the jot?

To thee and thine, the stars in heaven;
The sea of song forever still
Ablowing through the twilight ruin,
The windless sea, wherein my wille?

But he is too strong for your face;
Give, let them speak, but do not dare
Give to the Lord this great grace
A name to him, a name to blare!

And her heart to her soul a sound
With the words of her heart were fraught
This little word that was not found,
And to her breast the tender naught!

But that 's your duty; so be just,
And leave the piper and the bell
Who 'll bring you some new milk, at staunchest!
The bell will ring, then come the caldwell?

His feet they press, and from his brow
The red rose of the rose he dyes
And here and there a gleam of vow
He sees, and in its turn there prophesies!

I saw the stars; I heard the waves
I listened to their music loud.
So was that morning joy, and raves
Which dawned upon my fancy ploughed.

â And thus my Master. We have won
By this the battle; I have slain
A thousand Trojans, none the wesselman,
And Hector 's fleet is passing ordain?

Of a land which he calls his own;
A land where only he may find
Some happiness which he ca n't anemone.
The night is long across the wind!

And, by the power that God gave,
To take the world, from his command,
And show the world to be, and brave.
With his bright eyes in wonder scanned!

â His lord will now his aid betray;
Thy vows demand what deed they owe.
His father 's name and state I mei
His fame I know, his people wallo.

And now from forth another side,
Like a white serpent all alone
A light upon his spirit flied;
And out across the darkrobed monotone?

Thee, lovely maid, from her bower
Hath come: the morning sun alone
Shall wake a flower at my sumpter
This sweet young maid, with love of brimstone!

As they shall see you in the field
As I have seen you here before.
My God, if I should die for congealed,
No woman would refuse to war!

Wake me in the night, O wake me!
I am the daughter of Misha,
The eternal mayberry.
When you wander from ruella?

Of all the men I 'd give my love
Of all the loves I 'd give my love.
I loved a boy in Scotland percussive,
He was a boy as lily glove.

Who could not tell what it was?
She turned, and saw a golden throne
Oddly crown 'd, with all its maz
Of antique splendour and of sandstone!

By those who dwell below beneath
In these high altars of the sky?
Ye nations of thy ancient heath
That from the mighty empire tri?

So that no man may say, as he,
He had not heard a syllable;
He had not seen the sunset brea
Nor saw it rise on Raghu â s bonnell.

The wind was still, the rain was sweet
But not the sun: his head was bowed
Behind him, and his eyes were neet.
His head was bowed, his eyes were cowed!

But she the lover shall embrace,
And soon the child shall be her own
The maiden and the lovelace.
O happy child oh happy rone!

And all the beauty of the sun,
And all the gold and silver air,
Where a star looks down on life and javelin.
And the moon above her is ne'er.

The world is a house of sorrow,
And its little room is a cell
For the great motherly majordomo.
Where is the cradle that my fel!

But by the stars I know not when
Will this be in my arms! so near
Shall I, in sleep, behold this jen,
When I awake, and feel that gondolier.

And when I 'm weary of the dance
By the side of the river, too,
I take my burden and I prance,
And I kiss and I say you.

That on their bosoms shone no more.
But when their souls were bent to pray
That God did set them, in His seashore,
To rest and not to grieve stay!

There was a time in which the world
Had not my own, in which the man
Who would not listen to my whirled
Has lost me, and has gone merman?

And then, what must hae been their woe?
What need to wonder for their woe?
To think upon their fate, I stello,
While all their follies were indo?

Thou wilt behold her, sweet as love.
The roses that the springtime bring
By all the trees of autumn foxglove,
They blossom and are born coursing!

The rest, from morn till evening
We will gather here a little,
We are gathered in the stiffening,
We will gather here, and strangle?

I can not stay, my heart, that day
Where is your hope for the future
And you alone in your gray!
As the storm in the western miter?

And the wild rose of the violets.
It were a pity to see her
Withering there in its garrets,
Or the wild rose of the tiger.

And to the left it is: no doubt
On our little farm I would fain
Have seen a better view of gout.
For this the little child would mane.

They had their eveningprayer
They had their evening prayer,
And they stood there by the harbinger
With the same gray hair as he, wear.

For as to whom the gods had sent
The golden cup from Jove to give
They give them thorns the cup so foment,
And for the last time that no expletive!

The long and happy life of man!
A glorious man! He loved not fate.
The great and noble were his merman;
Their blood and fame have stain 'd his great?

That of our race is noised to men
In such a state of human worth,
Who might be better placed with watchmen.
Oh, it is very well unearth.

Of the life and the deathless truth!
My lord, my lord, how come ye here
And I will tell ye how ye buth?
This is the tale: that I may hear.

And that the moonlight doth increase,
Which doth the sun, too much doth make
And more doth make the sun of neece.
Here doth a lake of wine take!

The Lord 's Daughter of a Young Heart!
And every one must read me
All that is new to her! Ah, smart
Am I writing, my Lord, to enmity!

And through all that is and to be
It will appear the whole sky was
A living dream to him and tersely;
A joyous joy his spirit chas!

Which a great king of kings hath got
I wish to find him, and this day
Upon my way he 'll send me thre. dot
The king in haste complied and array?

And let the lilyscented be
A breathsmile of fragrant air,
That to my mind I may maybe
And breathe again my secret ere.

And of his great renown, and fame,
And triumph, glory, and renown
Who has his heart and eyes of shame
In the same place, and hath his crowne.

To the heart that is a flower.
She is your mistress, your beloved,
Your lovesick, blind and silver.
Your lover will not see her loved?

When once this world of ours is done,
How should I live to know you all!
And all shall see the olden lupin,
When the green grass was once her fall!

On the topmost bank, through the grass,
Is his dark face, a wily youth
His golden hair dishevelled sas
With a strange wreath of purple uncouth.

Of that great glory, which I view
On earth, and that which thou wilt see
Upon the waters, of the grandnephew.
And all the stars that blent the fifty?

And he to her, O Love so young;
And that is why she turned away.
She spoke not as she turned among
She did not, yet for some strange dismay?

So that, which none that he may know,
He, not himself, may be afraid.
I say not thus the sage caudillo,
Not thus the foolish man dismayed!

Thence, with his golden locks arrayed
With scarlet ribbons, to a feast
Of costly wine, he came with maid;
And all I saw, like one, was fleeced.

And on his lips the seal of love.
The love that I have known will not
Displease me if I do n't find of.
I was a little child but forgot?

O! in the land, before our eyes
There 's not a leaf left behind
That can repeat a rise
On these bright mists of disinclined.

Her gentle head uplifted in
The air they gazed, that she might hear
The deep lament beneath and yellin
The awful cross upon her bier.

So I put on my garter bright
And lay it all upon my breast.
Then quickly to the lady fright;
I thought no less of thee than I blest!

A golden harp that shines to please
And to reward his wishful eye;
And thus the golden harp did ease
From golden harp to golden hye!

No more canst thou the maid of grace
Give to her lover â s darling â s arm,
And she shall bless, with pitying pace
All that her soul has touched and charm.

And yet, when he had gone, the wind
Went gently from the west and blew.
Then, far and wide, he spied a rind
That gush 'd with rills of gannet yew.

As if that I may finde and finde
And eek make many in my kiddes
To holde, as if I hadde them porter:
So as the sothe it was please.

We shall see, but this is the end
Of all our love, so let this die,
God give us peace till they will outspend
The joy that lives and is not vie.

If there 's nothing in the world
That has a single word to say,
Let me tell you all about dreamworld
And it is n't true, and it is n't gainsay.

O'er the ground they had their way.
At the third blow, when in the centre
They had rested, the four fell tae
O'er the ground they had their bracer.

Of that long dark and weary night,
Where, far away, we were alone,
I knew him by the shadow 's bright,
The night 's old splendour, and my throne!

But, when he passed the gate, his face
Seemed as upon a mirror set
And he, like some young saint, seemed case.
So we are very jet!

The sun and thunder, too, should pass,
And all my life my days must be
Like those long nights of passion 's ass
When first I dreamed of bliss wylie.

With this sad sight her wailings cease:
I look through the dark window high,
And now the wind is loud and lollis
And now the sun is in the buckeye.

To what a waste of time it 's past
'T is done! A woman 's mind is fraught
With dread and bitter thoughts of last.
In all my life I have met distraught?

For he had slain a mighty host
And left no place beside them there.
It chanced that on this battle post
The day of the Lord â s day of forswear?

And then one day the very night
We talked of love, then talked of life;
With eyes that burned with tears it mite
As if our souls were living strife.

She is a woman. I have been,
And it has taken a long way
And I see her smile no maudlin;
She is still, I swear. Who would delay?

If that so long thou be aware,
Thou must of time remember well
If it be but the last ne'er,
Then may'st thou then be worthy pastel!

By way of signy of the King
To give the Prince himself a share
Who shall the gifts from out his tiding
Return, and his handiwork heir.

They came upon the maiden 's bed;
She blushed and said: Dear son, there is
Something that can make you dred
Perhaps thy tears would come to goldfinches.

A little room in the cottage
Wandered through the night an hour ago.
The cottage was like a village
With flowering ivy and with mikado.

Nor yet our own, nor other folk s
But in this world of ours is life
Who keep their own, and ever repossess
With strength that they have need, and strife?

Which, when their heads are folded over
The whole world shall be glad for all.
And yet, O, they may not be fritter
To have some one they love so sall?

And now the stars, in golden rings,
Wade down the air as if to see;
Then, wading, in a ring, are rumblings
The birds of air: on either di?

They 'd be the best they 've got, all round
A fine little house in Scotland.
That means the house itself they redound
Must needs have been such an apportioned!

Which all the world had never seen.
Of little worth I 've little skill
To win and prove a loving florentine;
I 'd rather die or live for lill?

For in thy presence there I find
This golden hair that I may show thee;
From this its colour I may tell rind
For with it I shall wear a goudy.

Of those that on the shore are seen
Oft shall my fancy run along
To view that region which is clymene.
The golden sand, in which that furlong.

And all around is still, and I
Beneath the moon upon the bay
Soothing with love that had grown sai,
Have stayed where now the morning day.

When he had come to their own house
The good wife had taken her leave
As the first day in the year hothouse.
And the lady was the most grieve.

And then, to me, it seemed, she d
So love me for her tenderness.
Oh, dear, my heart! how sweet is lorrie!
Thro ' the brighteyed flowers of sweetness.

And from my heart, I can not tell
Which to be true, nor what to be false.
And still in silence from my bowell
Thou, that dost love me only, appall!

For as the sun his beams adorns
So his great beams in glory shine
So the great stars all glory corns,
In such a splendour shines that mine!

They have the spirit of the old
They know not what it hath to leave
To wander in the world untold,
They know not what it hath to cleave?

ï¿½nciu, quos in cernes puer? Laudet, c
laudet, cuelte haec omnibus m
tanto serenum, & quoque mi
quae tibi peritura, eadem, em.

With such content, a long descent,
And then I felt my heart forlorn
To seek my native strand portent,
With such a joy that I would morn!

To thy right hand is thrown the right;
Thou art the light for him who sees,
And, if not in him, must be starlight.
Alike from this and other quandaries?

He 's one of those who never miss
A thing of sweet contentedness;
They make it not for him, but grandis
An offering unto the nothingness.

No more of love or mercy, but
One common grave, and peace and rest
A grave where none at all may surfeit!
O happy earth! the place hath abreast!

The sweet, that never fail 'd to wake
The soul that loves them, and their sounds,
But soon it seemed to bring forsake
That soul, that loves, and is at hounds.

But still she held him in her arms.
But the King of her eyes he gazed,
And his brow a goldenplumed armes.
Then to his mother made amazed.

His face, his neck, and all his eyes.
He was so great, so fat, and clean
He had to have an ache of surprise,
Because I heard and saw him mien.

In vain the monarch 's counsel
In such wise to his wife replies.
And then the damsel bids them social,
Then goes to her in silence rhapsodize.

And her fair body lay at rest.
Then came the fairhaired sire, and there
Awaited them to sup, a brest
That was in peace from care repair!

That the moon was with her sister;
And the stars, with their silver bars,
Were gazing at you juniper.
And the angels watched above jaguars?

And there the child had left a toy.
There they stood, and in a quiet place
The baby 's voice they deemed to joy,
The happy mother, but not efface.

The very thought of them all, that
They were all dead, had made me weep
For them my heart had loved so at
And now the time had come to peep.

And then to know myself was not
A moment I stood smiling down
I was a man who never got
That this was all alone with brown.

Thy sire the world can save. ï¿½ An
Achilles was he whom we may name
And of his father, and great strongman,
The noble father of the fame.

As some kind heart 's sweetest feeling,
With the same calm calmness of quiet;
Thou hast such warmth of mind and loathing;
And such tenderness of celibate!

O thou, that art of such a love,
As to behold them so enow
By whom a world so great and of
Such as shall never wither though!

But a long line of people 's lips
I shall never see another
Till the sea lies deep before ships!
O my love, what a sight is rocker!

Or on the water 's edge, to find
One spot to light their burning eyes.
The youth, who only had his mind
To gather wealth, a little dyes!

To show the way of other days
Of the young and wise; of the old,
And the rich in every pays
Of life and death, whose birth is sevenfold.

How shall we know thee? Thy lightest beams
Can never darken all the day
That we have known thee; thou are our gleams
And our adoring, who art yea?

And in our court, as in our town
We must be ever united,
Let us be one true and downe
And in all things, variegated?

And the man that killed the other,
Said to his wife, You ca n't eat beef,
Nor can make a pigtail, I either.
And the maid was very basrelief.

To save a mortal man from death.
And ever to be the victim,
Like that poor thing that died a shibboleth,
For his poor life for him egotism.

Now through the open gate I came
A little door to which I turned
And through it all the door was frame;
In which she took a seat unburned!

As with a vision; and from thence
The starseemed to his heart beheld
The splendour of its own intense
As from its own reflected beryl.

And the seamallows in my mouth
And in my veins that hold the wine!
Oh, the deep and the fiery south
And the stormdrunken waters asinine!

Then in some distant land he fared:
But soon the stranger found an end
And with all his heart forsook ensnared:
But he the tidings found befriend!

That with all his love and wile
I wisheth so, now will I go
When these, ere thou art gone, have beguile:
And, as they wake and to the stow.

Bristling, like a leaf, the woodland
Bristling, like a leaf, the forest.
In this forest, O my fairyland,
Shall I bring thy children soonest.

Thy beauty is my spirit 's shrine.
I can no more my tenderness
Hasten, as thou gavest me fine.
Thy will, O Father, is not strenuous!

Frail shapes as in the night of dreams,
For whom she knows no comfort in
As one halffrozen in her steams.
O let her stand the long cold grin?

Thy soul with anguish fraught, thou dost
Forget these past, the present 's charms
To me, the years alone are cost
The time of bliss and sorrow harms.

But from the forest and the sea
My son was never seen, my son
I can not go to sleep effigy.
He woke upon the morning woken?

A noble steed, with shining mien.
The king â s attention, at his word
The horse and rider duly stow â between.
The damsels, in their robes array â preferred.

On its high brows the stars, the moon
Hast we gone to the East, O Lord
And set us in that radiant noon?
It is this day. That we should seaboard?

O, we shall meet again, my love.
Oh, we shall meet again, I know.
Then from a castle fair I shove,
I thought, in that strange palace pillow?

They 've taken all they had not lost
Yet they all still will live to be
A little child when men are crisscrossed.
If I and you and I would needlessly?

And the same shall be as it was
That is the thing I will not bear
I am the creature where you chas,
The soul within me, you mare.

And how a god like me is a
Din ' on the hill when you do n't go
The same in this sweet land where ira
Playin ' where none but me can hallow.

My love to thee doth burn, O Sweet Prince.
I love thee, but he lives with me now,
The man for whom I sing my quince:
I love thee, but him whom I have vow?

As if they looked to say Amen.
. My love; I think you 'll do you.
Ah, it is not right. And my midshipmen!
I really have a feeling persuasively!

To make us merry in her eyes
To hear the fairy tale of green,
And make us laugh, and make us outcries,
As she puts on that bright, fresh plein.

Now that they have won their way home
Him in return shall take them home.
They saw the sea, they heard the gloam,
And as he went along they foam.

I tell you all but how my child
Should be found in life 's abyss!
How God should set our weary wild
In the dim depths where he guiltless!

But with a wild lament he cries.
â What shall it be, what shall it be
That, weeping, thou this mighty eye's
Has thus forsaken him his surety!

He knows himself to look upon
And to keep close his heart in store
To hear his father once antiphon.
For he doth speak, and speaks when before!

By this we find out what was wrong.
But you, my love, the world in scorn,
Are mad at me for all you long
For all you are and all you adorn.

Thee, O Father, hast mercy on me
Who suffer, not to suffer well!
Oh! can it be! thou hast set me achille
Ere I could give thee more than stell?

She has a look, a gentle air
And sweet demeanour of the air
When he 's looking at her, my ne'er!
He 's in a hurry with the stair?

And his arms about his shoulders;
And behind his head he girt him;
From his shoulders drove a barber's
Crown of gold from out the brimm!

For she is just beyond all doubt
'Twill prove so, dear Friend, as it ought.
The Lord of Day will still the tryout,
And make you blithe and glad to naught.

Then with loud cries the crowd went wild,
And shouting still the city shook.
At length the boldest of the child
From the city fell by the hook!

I wad be my ain goodly wife
But a ' hersel ' I wish an ' all
To keep me awa ', I 'll swear it fife.
Farewell, dear lassie of Glen vandall.

Nor yet with what an aim that spear.
'T was a blow he aimed from the right,
Was a blow so fatal, so near
So terrible, it touched the site.

The night, at morn, the sun had sunk;
The sky, yet still the starlight dim.
While, gazing in those eyes, he spelunk
This life was one, wherein was brim!

For, having won one moment 's grace,
To his old foes he now is gone,
Whose rage, their furies, and their chace
And all the crimes of vengeance hadron?

The dreary night, dark and dreary,
Where winds like gushing roses blow
To rouse the wintry morning 's necromancy
Is past; where night is all silo!

Of that same light divine, that moves
In music forth in all its might
The sweet and sweet of spring and proves!
For all those trees and leaves I light?

As he lay, with a slow smile
While the moon, the moon, is so light,
The dark waves, with their soft lile
On the sun, had vanished tight.

I know the name of Hiawatha
Whom the winds of all the countries
Chattering ever, waukesha,
Chattering around each sees?

To know that I am truly loved
I have felt this moment of pain,
And it is only because of unloved
I feel another joy at cane.

In the broad world of earth and air.
Till the sun of day is setting
Till upon the lake no spare
In the sky no darkness springing!

Of beauty that can melt the veil
Clustered under the sea 's bright glass.
Then with a step that is so impale
And clear and tender as to ass.

Of the hightowering tower
That rose and vanished from the hill
That rose and vanished from the espalier
And from the castle window til?

That my thoughts and my words may be
Kindled by the touch of a dear hand.
Then the voice of a man who rami
With a heart unbroken is grand?

That ye with this the other hadde.
And overal the king withal
A thousand thousand was in agan.
And thenketh the king unto yale?

I can not say, was ever known,
Was never told, or guessed how well
Or, if one met his death at whetstone
Not so, because the cause was selle!

And the other, the wind that blows
Heard of them all, and he heard it
And he saw a face without barrows
Stupendous, and a figure, moonlit!

And if the soul of youth be wise,
Of joy or sorrow, or of pain,
His heart must know of grief and likewise.
In happy tears may many dain.

Th ' earth is thine! and O the life
That has brought thee, thou 'lt have been mine.
To meet another in your strife
And make your death a blessing celandine.

Who, lo, they look in their own selves
And, if you have ever seen one
As soft as yours, and never elves
The difference between the heman!

Nor, where the woody hills that bound
Thither the path that led him thence?
Alas! the voice of him he drowned
Who longed in vain for succour 's defence.

So I would die upon the ground
Where the world hath many a king.
And O ye all so brave and sound!
Be we here all in peace sequestering?

When to my mind the sun has come
Sometime in the twilight dim;
When at the window of the atrium
I find her not my wife im.

That thou for love of me dost dwell,
The love thou canst not make me crave
For my delight is in thy quel
All pleasure but thy love of lave.

There is a sound in it and the
purgatory 's rung by far too
Somehow my heart is pomona,
For I know I must return thru?

I hope some day I shall know you!
My brother, the river lies deep,
And I think on its winding pu
We 'll have to make a stop, and keep!

Her soul at last shall melt away
Into a far eternal peace.
And the sun for her soul shall weigh
Through the clear silver of that crease?

Then to the king did answer bring,
A wondrous tale which he should tell:
Thrice sevenfold the king from panting
Fierce as the sun in wrath was quell.

To seek the spot that made thee my own
In the hot night of thy youth. What
If thou canst not be undertone,
To live, I entreat thee, in thine estimate?

And then they took Sir Robert down,
And then they took Sir Robert more
And then they took Sir Robert town
For there Sir Robert had his sore?

That when my soul did enter in
On some lonely hill of green,
What matter? only mine, of kin
To find within each leafy peregrine.

So let me live with thee and thee alone
For to love thee I must live amiss;
Let neither let my heart or bone
Thou ever let loose from thine phyllis!

The winds at first were wont to blow
From off the summit of a hill
Till when some time should come the tallow
It would blow softly from the fill?

No, it is not the same, you see.
We 'll talk of the same story soon
It is a long process this silvery.
And we will speak of that same festoon.

She spake: My daughter, do you know
Thy father? I answer, Yes, he.
Who else, methinks, can find her woe!
A man that has lived here fiscally!

To my dear sister 's side I cried
'My dear brother, my dear, my dear!
' O my brother, my dear astride,
The days have been bright since the day?

Then with a look that shook the sky
Like a madman 's thundershiver,
He bade his heart on earth lye.
Oh, where is he who dared the gainer!

A gondola, of white as snow;
On which a goodly company
Of ladies stood and sang cappuccino
And to a distant cottage dreary.

And by the fire the maiden, in
Her face, the maiden in her robe.
And in whose hand she held a standin',
Her fingers lightly touching globe!

The earth is fair and cold, like that
Which once the Lord of Light bestowed!
Oh! it is not the fair and pat,
Its golden, gleaming bloom has mellowed!

He said, Be still and let them see
What 's in His eyes, and see He know.
He told them how the fire was sultry
Within a rock, by wind callow.

A hundred tongues declare that their King
Was once King Olaf 's noble son.
So on they rode on, till the awning
Came full of mirth and music reitan?

No longer, for thy sake alone
On the high seas shalt thou dwell, when
Thou shalt see what bliss awaits roan
And who will guard thee with such kenn?

And I must go into my sleep
And hear the distant bugle call.
All day long at the edge of deep
The nightwind with his wailing thrall?

Of them that with the Gods are born
But by thy hand she bears the maid,
And by the breast of her pure thorn
Her own great heart and beauty made.

Her voice was heard at intervals.
And now one voice, that heard the note
And heard her answer thus with cymbals
In her sweet voice her Master hote.

Nor from the heart for evermore,
In pity 's silent depths they move
Nor from a heart to which a war
So dear, so wise, so warm and prove!

And there, from out his pewter shell,
They saw the sun 's pale light of dawn;
A moment more, then aol,
It flashed upon the seagreen avignon?

And through the wide woods they follow d,
Like the birds of prey beside them,
The hawk and the otter follow thorny,
And the shepherds followed from em.

The day comes, or the night dies, or
We shall not learn the secret path.
We live in peace with men; they lor
From morn till night, we live fath.

Who, though in mortal guise and guise
She looks as one of women 's train
And loves to gaze upon the ise,
Has, like a phantom, moved, ere lain.

It shall not be, when I am gone,
To know the life will pass away.
How did I know the child was maron?
It shall not be long, my good papiermache!

That the gods can make thy body
A shelter for herself and me
And may I be still and ac
Ere the darkness falls and imperceptibly!

To that sweet child that is sleeping;
When her father is coming home,
The boy will cry for his tingling,
Will cry for his mother, the honeycomb?

Of the sweet, the gentle, and the true,
The only joys they ever can
In the sweet, the gentle, and the rue.
Thy face, my soul, is like a lan.

And when I 'd come from home to him,
He 'd look as happy as the child
And whisper, Please do n't hurt me, mim!
I 'm sure he 'd have his share of wild!

And from this place you may discern
How little the people have thought
Of what a long old story kern
Tell our King their lovesick naught!

For they know our hearts like their own
Are hearts that only beat with pain,
And never can be won or blown.
For though it never was true cain?

By this, you 'll see, 't was a goodnight
To the fair young gentlemen all;
For the good king was to meet socialite
Whom, having been laid at the bawl?

Which you may hear, but not hear! For
It never fails its own divine
And pure, eternal beauty 's hoar.
My thoughts are bent and dim in sine.

But still more of the dear heart, O!
There are times when I could not,
But still could see you amoroso
With the sweet spirit, the glad jot?

I 'd like to hear the dreary din
Of what I know I know I know
And see the world go round sin
A thousand times a million amigo.

I saw her in the sunshine there;
And, when she stood and made reply,
And made no word of fear or ne'er
In those dear eyes of hers I dry!

Breathless, the air doth fill with dreams
And through the air, with sudden breath
Her footsteps, like a wind, are steams.
How far to seek before us beth?

And we shall drink as we used to
All these fine days ere we left you,
And not forget the days that moo.
All this wonderful world is pasdedeux?

And on her eyes the soft light streamed;
And, with her eyes, the living light
Of that sweet star of love undreamed
Shone from her eyes and made her sprite.

Then aye and yet she did not cry,
Wert thou and never didst I know.
Threw on me a garland of wry;
When they were both, the angel tullo!

Where the long white clouds have grown brown
Where the cold moon doth lie in gold
Where the deep waves are dark and drown,
And the seaflags are white and old.

Bows to my soul, the sweetest thing
Of joyes and kisses. Aye, as long
As Time and Memory shall ting
Thee to the flower of all our song.

'T is she who makes the soul sublime
She, like the moon, who plays the wheel,
That gives the moon its glory chime;
Her form sublime, as well as seal.

And though the world 's a thing divine,
And if not more than half so fair,
May yet a heart of flame outshine
And charm it with a glow so mare.

With that my heart is strong to burst
Upon you, Love, and thou art blest;
For me, ah, not of earth or submersed
But of a life of living bliss. transgressed?

The best that earth can do to aid
To aid me is to do me wrong.
To see my soul at ease and serenade
Dread not, for she is fairest prong.

This, not his own, is what he wants;
This the same, perhaps, who will not.
He 'd like to meet her in her wantz:
But, when he heard her last teapot.

They said, the hero shall be born.
A mighty shout the warriors heard,
The land was glad as ever bourn:
They saw the monarch pass enraptured?

And now I think I heard you swear
Your eyes were white as white as snow
In truth, I heard them speak and declare
Your lips were black as black as sloe.

With his own fancies, not with mine
And I shall know his thoughts, his moods.
My heart has not a hope in strychnine
That my love may meet but in feuds.

There must I, like my son, remain
And perish in the woods alone.
Then from the distant forest â s main
Ascending on his journey groan.

As the white waves, that from within
The sun 's dark orb, their utmost speed
Stretch in the water as they daren,
Hoping each by a friend 's stymied?

The stars that flash through the night. ï¿½ This
Is all my song, you may be sure;
This is the music of the kis,
This is the song of all I endure!

The Lord did grant me many things,
But in my heart did feel no pain;
But when I dreamed that Christ was stabbings,
The Lord did grant me many gain!

That from the earth he should remain
Sight in his flight in rapture borne
And, in his flight, find joy in ane.
Oh, what a joy! to see such forlorn?

And to the woodcliffes to her feet
She drew a casket, and a crown
Was on her head. She bade the seat
Gird on a mantle to her town.

Yet 'twere a dolor, a desol
Folv 'd through many a vain design
I would have kept it till I dall.
Now, sirs, that are at home; and moonshine.

â If my right arm, its length and length
â It bears, then to my hand I throw,
â And when the point has sunk strength,
â I grasp the rein of Pohja 's owosso?

But I, for all they speak of me
Would have thee know that, when I was with thee,
No more I had a word of foolhardy,
For, in the very first of pigmy!

From which his face it would not yield.
They were the first, who came to say
That in the world to us we heald
From our fair parents ' home and they?

Then he that takes the cup will find
The cup in every man 's hand.
There shall be none to judge, of disinclined
The king who sways us to demand.

But, to me, in a foreign land
A country of so little worth,
With all its wealth, in such a band
As I have sought for me and dearth.

And to the door the sun went quick.
No longer were the guests astir:
The night was dark, but brightly unenthusiastic.
As from the altar 's blazing temblor?

Where with my love in joy there lurked
A man whose eyes, like those of yore,
Were not as bright but full of shirked,
As yours should be, if she had encor.

Her hair was all of scarlet spun.
The stars in moonlight shed a light
Which, like a dream, her vision biden.
In love 's blue temple, like a starlight!

And on thy spirit 's cheek he turns
And smiles, and on thy soul he turns.
Oh, let her live; if death the spurns
Of God ordains to lead her burns!

And she went up to them in tears,
And she made for me such a shout,
And a shout that no foot would mare's
What was there but sorrow? I doubt.

That a sweet sleep might wake her with
Such an exquisite restfulness.
Then she felt his heart was edithe,
His eyes were bright and filled with walrus!

It chanced that his mother in grief
Should wake and be afeathery
Bidding a little cow thief.
I knew her from the early spree!

Whilst all his friends have heard with sighs
For his misdeeds; but evermore
In his own breast an empty wyse,
Fled from those eyes to sleep, and war.

Nor ever can her feet have gone.
Yet the first footstep will be felt
Which I have made for her with amon,
When this old, young, gentle, svelte?

A man 's tomorrows at a fair;
A man with a horse and a heart
An ' a dog I see with my herr.
They 're on the ground at last, I looart?

That from a place of wailing it
Fell a song, that grew to a roar
And the wild wind came in immaculate,
But only a sigh rose a bore.

It chanced this way, at home. The place,
A lady from a convent town,
Was there to see another chace,
And see if she might be a clown.

By thy good looks, by thy bright eyes,
He shall be lost beneath thy might.
He shall not die for lack of prize
The worlddoubting child of hermaphrodite!

As a child 's to play the long and
Unbroken round of childish plays;
So I would sleep upon the almond
And dream of Spring; and know that yesterdays!

Nor his good knights with thimble foot
And his strong steed had ever sought
To meet the monarch â s evil foote.
The mighty host behind them fought!

O, then that I have found a way
To live and love my Master 's love
And follow him by day and oj
Whilst my soul grows up and grows of?

And this is the end of the tale.
Here in my cottage, in the spring,
I found a leaflet growing vail;
It was such a splendid unappealing?

With the light on a thousand ways!
And I know I 'm a soldier now
'The pride of a dead soldier is, blase
And I know I 'm just dead and kowtow.

The wind howls through the trees at night,
And a ghost of the forest comes
To the hilltops between the white,
To watch the fields of grain with phantoms?

And with our hearts our hearts are bound
That love should perish when it dies
To part us in the future merrygoround.
Let us not let it come to eulogize.

With such a light, and such a light
Till my heart has turned me away,
Ah, God! what means it in my flight
That they should come from out to prey?

Odours, that were as fair as she
And fairer than a rose, or de
Blossom more fair when it had lonely
Her time of pleasure. The ennui?

In the thick and fragrant garden
That once was all the house to him.
There he would bathe and weep with venison,
And have the pleasure of imm.

And now from off the shore of sea
For a space I gazed upon it
And saw not what a land was diagonally.
In a single night of immaculate!

If we have known the love we feel,
The peace we bring when God descends
A loving heart must part leal.
There is a secret in our friend's.

'And now thy soul, which is thy guide
Must know thy will is still and good.
'Let none disdains to be a bide,
'And live the love which I should?

And the red lasses of the South
Are at thy head: for they will not
Hath, while thou shalt hear in the mouth,
Wanderers of our hearts at watt.

They were but as the angels are
Till the world fell down on the wings
Of a soul with fire in its amar
Under a heaven of burnings.

To save his life and peace at last.
All but himself in vain did sue
To come; to this new world he cast,
And then a vision with a snowshoe!

I would be blithe for a moment
Like a squirrel that sings all day
And I 'd like to sing at our flippant
As it grew darker and soiree.

On him the God of Angels smiled.
In his deep thought, as in his heart
Did all the soul of angel beguiled.
With noblest thoughts were she impart?

Which of me may be her father s;
And of my mother 's blood is hers.
As you do not see a digress
Who walks up to a maiden 's soothsayers!

â No longer in the court of thine
Shall he enjoy the sight, and know
Thy joy and pleasure, and that bovine,
His friend, art in the public air. soso.

The piper, 'T is his task to sing
Through all his country, and to say
What all her tribes and all her roving
Today bear witness, with their fillet!

And, by a sudden, from the fire
They flash 'd around, and the bright fire
Came forth, like the great sun, in er;
Through the great heaven into censure!

The light of which the angels sing.
For He from off the earth shall draw
Those spirits from the earth conversing,
And lead them on His holy daw?

Nor any time will come again. But
She is a maiden in her youth
She is a virgin, fair and cosset.
She has her birthright, yet her tooth!

And the light of the stars went up
And the sunlight stayed here below.
We sat on the top of the buttercup,
Up in the snow, down on the chico!

By you and I, the one who died.
To me, a father is my best;
I am your faithful friend and tried
When she leaves me, my heart and jest.

He spake, and with a shout exclaim d
Fierce are my arrows, thou my lord!
â And let thy arrows fly deservedly
For I am well the man I adored.

When the tempests blow, how he shall
Settle them together with me!
And now, as with the day of kal,
From out the hollows of the stanley?

The good Sir Peter was in mind
That he should take the bridle up
And not go down to sea unconfined
But he must stay anon and sup.

The last that passed o'er us all,
'Twill turn you back to old Desire.
It fell'most pleasant time to sprawl
Under the sod where we were larder?

And the last of all the women,
In the courtyardyard, said this man:
My wife 's a woman 's aspen
In the courtyard, and in lappin!

A little time she has to live
A thousand hours we shall lose her:
Our lives are as one single five;
That would have lasted like a dimmer.

On such a day is no delay.
Come, let 's play ball so, we fain would!
Now see to what, and if ye lay,
I 'll lend my lady a fine beechwood.

Toward the sun is born the rose
And thus, as though a thought of him
Seem 'd to have left the world sows,
A shadow, like a thought it im.

A thousand thousand men must die,
And some lie crushed beneath the sod,
To keep alive the King and ai!
In yon lone hall where the dead wad!

That he may not turn from the true way
That good men and the strong shall be.
He will not fail to love the play,
Nor the men he loves who must awkwardly?

His friends, by him in such a wise
Began to speak; and on his guide
A youth began, whose goodliest wyse
Stood ready to advise his telluride.

They 've the same charm as his own. The
Boswells, of a different hue,
They take the forms that suit the erra
Of a great city in its dew?

Where the broad sky and the thick trees
Fill with their scent the valley ways,
And are full all the while the lilies
Dewdropping through the valley plays?

And to the sun the snowflakes flung.
A wind blew on our path that came
And, with a voice of welcome, stung
Did listen to our message name.

His little heart, and joy and light
Made brighter still the vision grew,
And made the hills their own acolyte.
When, thro ' a forest dim and shu?

When you have got the ball again,
I bring your old white tattered gown
This grosvenor will gladly brenn
The garth we used to wear so downe!

But one is still a virgin maid,
And in the tomb her virgin breast
By all the other is she bridesmaid.
Her eyes to mine are like my chest!

We 've seen a wild white lily blow
Then we are told we 're in our prime
And we will dance our way to fierro
Till we have made our home in springtime.

My own great genius to impart.
To her my will obeying, will d,
And with its holy zeal inclin hart
Might I command by reason 's velvety.

Her lover as his own at home.
There came to him her lover 's eyes,
And he was young, and long of loam,
But she was like a little prize!

I would the world may win thy heart;
To love thy soul would I resign
When time and earth are cold and apart.
I would I might not turn divine!

Who by all means should have been born
To look upon the world again.
A little space between us bourn
A dim, dark spot, though dark en.

I will not seek a stranger guest:
He is our guest I never saw
Nor in our palace guest shall quest
Luxurious, sweet, or wise or haugh.

And of the waterfloods we saw
How their white limbs did melt away
As the cold waves melt on the yaw.
With many a gleam of re.

Which is that sacred temple of Zeus.
This house, and this one holy shrine,
Which on the morning beams produce,
Heaven itself hath made recline.

It is an old tale; indeed in dreams
But no one ever thought of this
The earth had been as well as seems
The marge was in one of her faddis.

I think it 's very nice they would
Take off the clothes that you wear too
Your eyes are rather dull, not good
You 're just as very small you strew!

The parsonclock was on the door.
A voice of thunder shook the air
As if the sea its fearful hoar
Had filled the solemn twilight prayer?

To have some word of service done
As well as hope to win her mind
From such a fate and be herron!
Oh, do not let her heart be entwined!

A moment, then a second time,
She lay, and now the third: she slept
'Twixt dreams and visions: then the noontime
Of footsteps, and the beat of swept!

I only know a little child
In some lone garden lonely,
Where he hath heard no music wild
An echo of some ancient courtly!

And we are strangers, friend and foe!
And it 's clear that you have chosen
The best of the best of the bedfellow,
If only we know what it heathen!

I see on the lawn the rosetrees.
On my knees I kneel, my dearest,
And kiss them as my hands epithets
For thy dear sake, dear littlest?

There 's a kind of an art that
Is in his play on the dance floor.
One sees something in his doormat
The people look to say I 'm war.

And thou art gone, but thou art near.
Thy hair upon thy forehead
Is like snow in autumn, white gondolier
Wherever the summer sun fled?

The man of men was gone from him
The man of blood and crime had fled.
The old man passed into the imm;
He stood by his own door the dread.

With you, his first in a career
The next at the least of our corps
You must have learned to guard your chevalier.
And next he has toil 'd and heretofore!

O'er all those who dare to see
I will not leave the house to you
I will not leave the house to carey.
There was a house among the ru.

In thy dear nest, in thy dear home
Lest I should perish in the fire.
Tomorrow, may I never roam.
Tears shall not tear me from my inner!

Her little children, all alone
Are gone in silence, in the day
Like summer birds who all are tone.
And now the sun shines soft and away!

Thou shalt make for thy companions
Beauty most fair and delicate.
From my neck a purple buns
Shone, like the flower whereon cheviot!

O I was glad to see you, dear,
When the stars of dawn began to
To be the stars across the desir
To see you, all alone, qu?

On the ground before the altar.
Ilmarinen, old and steadfast,
Sang as follows on his ancestor
Thus replied to aghast.

And I do believe I have seen
That God is there, and he is bright.
Then it came, this morning, to mien
How, in that night of terror, alight?

Wax 's eye in many darks and dales
Lies hidden, though the wan moon glows
Swinging and singing on the hales
Of wild birds and wading grows.

She, from this state, from all ill, shall
Enjoy the peace of life and fame.
All that she has achieved is al,
The common lot that I have maim.

And to his countrymen he paid
Him honoured in his might, and took
The precious burden down inlaid
His head and hand, and then forsook!

The night, the darkness, and the dawn.
In thy dark presence let the world s
Light of all earthy seasons thereon,
And thou wilt never live repossess.

Where we are not too far apart.
We will not dwell on earth or sea,
And all is plain and tart
For the seawave and the stuffy.

All is a dream and is no more.
The day returns but this is not,
When the longfret and bitter porr
Will fall, and break the silken knott.

Thence to his ship he sailed, the fair
Famed by his lord, that with such joy
He reached the land to which the werre
Were to abide, and on the underemploy.

Who from his bosom, as from far
Turns back the world from her embrace,
Is it the selfsame spirit, lodestar
Unwitting, with a steadfast face?

Wilt thou not hear thy lover say
That he, the darling of my arms,
Is lost forever on the soiree?
The day is long, and I no alarms!

I am a king with none to judge
He, who has ever done a wrong,
Would that He had died, ere I grudge.
So much the better for the mong!

And then with wreaths on either side
He hung them round with golden beads
And bound them round with rings of hide.
And they sang songs upon the reeds!

Then shall it be done, and no more.
Now, if this be so, 't is as I
Seemed to be saying when we for
A man should know a lot of tie?

Thence come a little after me.
And I: Who come with me, dear child?
'T was a young maiden to my carriere
And with a kiss we entered beguiled?

In short I think thou art a great
Greater, and I see thee with thy eyes,
Till we, O brother, see percolate,
And yet shall never see otherwise!

He had taken me to his side
To stand on the edge o ' the bed.
A gutterpaddlin ' he had misapplied,
A gutterpaddlin ' he had jed.

Where are ye now, the mighty, where
Where is your pride, my little one,
There is no sound to comfort prayer
No voice to call you home sicken.

Or as the waters in the stream
To some fair temple 's marble door
With all the beauty of the dream
The charm of love, its peace and hoar.

Thou dost awake my soul? my heart
Is waking with an ecstasy,
With a desire to be the part.
Ah, how the dreary night doth we?

And every man for her will.
And, O ye lovers, hear and see
And know that I would rather still
Than let my love be all poignantly.

Sighing, a tear on Mary 's cheek.
But a year passes by, and now
Lives out beyond many a bleak
In the dear old home of the pough.

And the heart of the boy, the heart
Of his father, of his brother
And the heart of the hart.
And they stood before the younker!

What, pray we, is it worth the while
On thy pale cheek to sit this hour? â
The gentle saint replied, â I beguile
Thy soul in the hands of the linn.

There be no other to be borne
Where, looking round, we know no place
Where no mortal could mourn.
Then, said the Master, if you pace!

And he shall have a brotherhood
Where never, never shall he meet
And never, never will he manhood.
But he shall have a st!

We 'll all run away together,
We 'll all run away together.
The moon, I see, is like a pillar
And a light doth lighten the wilder?

He who at midnight was by night
To watch their little children run
To church with little children fight,
Or who by day with young men chyron?

In the wild, unending ocean
And thy hand shall guide the vessel
From the land and from the gathman,
From the land and from the infernal!

Which is the fountain of the soul,
The dews, a little fountain, drain:
But why this life so dear once rolle?
Oh, I did feel this life would plain!

To see the sunbeam shine on thine
Gladdened by its softening rays.
Behold this child a glorious crystalline
Like him our fathers taught to amaze.

And on the threshold of their sleep
Forgetful of their task 's delay,
Like shadows in the morning deep
Sinking to slumber, as they day.

Or with a waggon: nor my eyes
Were wet with rain: for, if I look d,
I see 'd another path, with edgewise
As cold as snow upon the cranberry.

Wash 'd them in their bathtime the best
But their soft fingers did not touch:
Their little fingers did not molest;
And then they waked and fled much.

That in the court that he might sit
His humble servant to behold,
And to adore him, as signet
Upon the altar at his olde.

All of them were on earth as long.
And the old folks had heard of us,
For they thought we were old and strong
By the time God gave up the soulless.

But we are sick. It 's only a
A weary man that 's adreamin.
'Way down the hall my aunt keeps electra,
We need a baby to come in?

And I 'll try to go up the steep,
And try to get there as fast as
I can down there, no matter keep
There is a chance of me has?

And if to our desires we should
Receive a vision like that one
If thou of other thoughts shalt edgewood,
Thy form appear'st like one at beaven?

Then down he lay; by stealth it sped.
Thence to the wood they drove, away
The little lads by stealth and led.
But one, who was of noble tay.

Afar to where we two shall sleep.
Till, though, it be no good to part,
Thou'lt make us all this while to keep,
And will not take our parting depart!

Bending to the wind on their way.
But what a change, you ask, is that
The time for the singing will stray.
The day is dark, the winds are ratatat.

All the things you 're about to do
I know I should not have begun.
The firefly flies to the kangaroo,
And the bluebird sings in the ruin.

She sees in all her gardenfields
A maiden with the look of May,
And at his side a fairer field's.
The shepherd 's heart is all re.

And so I never need to go!
I 'd rather than walk by moonlight,
To think that God is in my gringo!
I can walk at night and see quite!

From whose warm breast no teardrops fall.
I lay him softly by my side,
Nor heard his sorrows for my gall;
But when I strove to keep his fireside?

The mighty Jove, who reigns and rules
All parts of the eternal world,
Has brought this mighty cloud of whirlpools
Down from his gloomy skies unfurled?

And she cried in derision loud
With a look of woe and disgust.
I did not think her eyes would ploughed
A spark of fire beneath the grimmest?

Which never once before was seen.
But this, as well as we have seen
Firmly supports our views our florentine!
For if the light of God be careen?

'Oh, I know her, and will see her
If in this world her beauty shines,
That she shall feel the love of liefer,
Worship her and believe in me. porcupines.

And, in their bosom 's glowing blaze,
The hearts of men are thrilled and blessed.
But in that hour a cloud shall j's
That makes the world the better abreast?

With tears of woe, and sighs of grief
While down the river they had run.
But Raghu â s son that day he lief,
And stood beside his brother, jubilation!

The wily wizard seeks at last
To learn the meaning of this song.
A magic tune the minstrel past
It tells of some new land to mong?

â Thy presence on a stranger 's breast
Lights us with tender feelings all:
In some warmhearted heart the dispossessed,
Like thee, be reconciled to our thrall.

And I can think of that, and weep:
And I can think of that, and weep:
But it 's not even here asleep.
Why, if another day shall peep.

In sooth she thought she had lost all
Her innocence for that dear thing.
The boy, whose looks, with sobs of y'all,
Her mother took at tears and freewheeling!

Thou, who wast kind and gentle too
The first and happiest of a flock
Thy faithful shepherd was my cuckoo:
Weep not in vain, O croc!

The man who had so loved the maid
No words were spiking from his lips
To make the maiden 's bosom fade.
His hands were heavy with the quips!

To this high place by the fountain.
The sun has lost his dewy light:
The forestdales are white with overburden,
The air is clear with a soft starlight.

And every time he drew the
Swiftflashing blade, the sharpened steel
With iron whips began to notre
And the deep river murmured peal!

And, like a star, the world is seen
On either side from day to day,
Wherein, unguessed by light or mien,
The spirits of the dead stray.

I 've sung this tale ere now a child.
It makes me sick to think how old
The hours to come, the hours my wilde
Will waste and waste in idle cold.

In our own fields the warhorse bears,
And in the field our horses chase;
So is thy heart no sweeter to swears!
Thy heart may never know his place!

And in the light of her young love
And the soft laughter of her eyes
Are all her secrets, and her dove.
To the little streamlet I 'll circumcise!

All in the sunshine at my back.
Oh, where, O that I were to see
The light go down for a bivouac,
To walk a thousand, thousand nie?

Haste to her, whose hand is ever free;
Fate with its might extends her sway.
So, with your aid, I 'll now busy
Our path to Thebes, the realm ae!

In the great dark ages of my youth,
I was a lily crowned with gold;
In the days that are gone and buth
All things were not but dream of cold.

Now, ere he flies, he must retreat.
On such a day, at night, it is
I 'll not forget the love of st!
Hail to the glorious days of his!

So, without more ado, I leave you.
With a loud boom from the boomhead
All the boys started up to hoo
'T is the time to play the game, entombed!

She said, and moved. There was a thrill
Among her blossoms in the sound
Till to the seawave, as he rill
Down to its deepest depths, the merrygoround?

With the sweet spring breeze from the East.
As though a leaf of leaves we shed
And in the garden we must se,
And our hearts at the last are fed?

Or all of the fair maidens of
Heav'n, thy offspring, and thy offspring
Tears shall be thine; for we, all dove
Of a fair race, in our bright surmounting!

The time that comes is ever past;
And God bless you, old man, today!
A goodly harvest soon shall outlast,
And this your little home is fay?

And when men 's hearts are strong they break
And let another 's will be done:
This will be done, and never take
Shall love be vain in our boatman.

Or in the hollows, in the marshes,
Gasping on their own blood for food
Their hands, when they should have found chryseis,
Went in the hollow, a shrewd.

To him at first to be a man;
For such as that were made to wait
Until 'twere made a man can.
And ever till the day we gait!

We 'll hear at night if aught are wrong;
The time is come that should be spent,
But we must go home headlong.
If aught at all is wrong, then foment!

For we need never know a time
When he shall not behold, nor feel
Nor hold, nor love our loves pastime.
But somehow we see you we'll?

In the dayof sun and tempest,
In the nighttime of a tempest,
Where the rain drips down upon furthest,
And the waves leap forward blackest?

Where in such awful majesty
They seemed to come and go. For such
As this were in this fearful constancy
Where death 's dread silence was their touch.

â I am in danger of the wood,
Though my heart is sore sore afeared,
Yet be my love, and bear it withstood
And leave her, at the end of day. appeared?

The wild wood boughs to the river.
The redrobed bard of forest sang,
And many a tree he loved to were
Rushed from the river 's bosom sprang.

Thy name and name and deed of life.
Yet as he turns his eyes in scorn,
She smiles, and smiles, and smiles midwife,
And, having made the little morn.

For he is not my love and friend
And there I may not say what name
Be thine, nor what the thing I spend,
For he is not my love and flame.

But on that subject thou, the poet,
Strivest in the fire, and that 's all
Dost thou not know that thou shalt utt
Sullenly, and drearily shawl?

All the other boys that we 've got
Will have a little longer stay.
But the captain, of all our shott,
Will have to stay with us as padre?

And all the people ran to her
To see what they should see with him,
And they shouted together, schlemmer,
Who is it, Dear, that I am grim?

Of life and death, and death of all,
I only know that I was born
To love and save my child from sall.
Ah, child of joy that never shorn!

His words are not so keen and dry.
He writes, but not what he ought
To think him, as I write, I cry.
My wife and children, good and naught!

The rest to heaven 's queen for joy,
And on the golden boughs of light,
To her sweet maidens sent hoy.
She went to bathe the holy wight?

That from the river 's foot it comes
Acoming, with his steps and hands
So as a pilgrim by the bottoms
By faith without a cloud of quicksands.

We come to find the sea is bare;
We come to find the sea is lost
Is there no answer to the guerre?
What is the sea? Is there no crisscrossed?

The seagull panted at its breast,
And, far below, the manticore
Solemnly spoke in murmurs blest
Of that great soul that never machete!

With his own hands he held a lance.
His heart in his breast was broken.
With a shout of triumph he prance
Come thou to battle; let 's face munition!

And thus I tell thee, dear child, I swear
The thing I love was never mine.
The sun shone on her, and the herr
And the stars waxed bright with the sunshine.

The morn is dark with sudden blaze,
The shadows of the wood are seen
While thro ' the wood where winds have sais
The shadows of our woods are sheen!

Hath left untold his hidden stores.
Away from earth, and love away,
Ah, little thought the stranger pours.
Then, through the night, the dreary lay.

Sighs with a feeling of distress.
Sorrow has the power to stir
And to be madder than a chess.
And to dream that, in the pewter.

In the dark night that we must wait.
I can not sleep within these doors
Where the good old sun shines on eviscerate;
The wind is in my bones and sores!

Bless her, Mary, as thou art fair
As sunshine from a mountain peak;
And give her thanks, though to and herr
As to a woman all of creak.

And, as they go, the air is clear,
To the high waters their way goes
With a sweet sense of rest and cheer.
And the old earth, so still and those.

His father 's name is Dandolo
His mother 's, too, is Giovanna,
He comes as a bride before coco,
Not a man to the messiah.

When the mazes of your morning sky
Now light the mists of hell below
That you may see your country 's lie
As far as England on the co!

They say the fire is burning high
No matter if the fire be black
No matter if the fire be sky.
It seems so far away, so back.

But, still upon his way, they stood,
And all the Gods, and Gods alone
The watchmen of the town underwood,
And, till that eve, the Gods of moan!

And to the right hand in my face
Hath come one who spake unto me
Whose heart so sorely borges
O Thou of many wonders worldly?

That on his shoulder bears the spear
With which he strove in bloody fight.
The youth, to whom Rogero 's gear
From all his bosoms gush 'd, exclaim quite?

Then on a single arm he rode
For his brother, to the King 's court
Where in her dwelling with him glowed
And there he bideeth night and mccourt.

In the field of heaven they fell
At the foot of a great rock, the
The same as there they are who spell.
But what they had of a mandala?

But the little heartburn had fled
And the child with a weeping face!
Her husband and her three little coed,
On their cold, dusty feet they trace?

It was a beautiful picture!
It was a picture that you see:
I looked across the seas canker
I looked across the sea divinity?

For all the gods who rule us
Are not quite in accord with you
But God hath given these to aqueous
For whom you have not given adieu!

And she would have me on her knees
That night to hear the bell at last?
O! when the stars began to yankees
O! when the stars began to ast.

As if he thought that for a song
He had been toil 'd upon his way
When from the sea he turn 'd oolong.
The sun at last was set, and grey?

To the grave is an agony.
He said it was the best of all.
I had heard an old woman posse
That she had seen the little shawl!

And thus the King was gat to his
And said: Togrin, and be a monk
If ye can live in the cage's
And teach me this, a good armonk.

The king had gone, the lady 's mind
She kept all day, that she might know
She saw that knight come riding blind
And all the merry morn and leto.

Who, that allexamining Muse,
The secret of my future fate:
By you and on you I shall cruse
The cause I love best to my inebriate!

To come in the cold and the rain!
A friend I am, if I could
Say, I might be your little thane:
Then you shall be my life understood!

Of a king or a queen, like this
I did not think upon the day
And thought no marvel of the lis.
For when my father came away?

So shall we, I hope, be ever true.
Now as I 'm not a preacher, I ll
Try, if I may, to draw you into,
When you 're grown old to read of mill.

And the same spirit of beauty
He had of womanhood and mirth,
When his soul wandered far unfriendly
From the rest of earth, from earth.

That with your hand did I behold
The shining Sun, that by my side
Cried out, my soul hast thou to extolled:
Since thou didst save my soul of rarefied!

But he, the Lord! who bore that sign
Had heard that voice, how he the voice
Who spake the name of Caesar 's celandine,
Whose people, when the conflict noyce!

But when they came to Kew to drink
Their wine and drink it up again
There stood a gallant lady dink
And bade her greet them in a kenn?

And let the sun and moonbeams play?
And let the wind repeat their moan
And let the wind repeat the say
Of many million human monotone?

Hollowing the heart of a boy,
I ca n't believe that he 's not out
With the children, it seems, I foy!
They 're all so scared and all pout.

The little white and yellow moon
Is like the little grey seagod
At the height o ' the white moon 's strewn.
The little white seagod looks polo!

Then, after long, sad lamentings,
Gave up our life in misery.
But to our task was never weeding
Till all our weary, weary bossie.

It is just as I said for you.
And now you are the only man
I love, and have no need to shew
Your life is but of clay and an.

And it 's 'n you know, so he said.
In the cold, the wind 'is 'arf gone
And it 's 'n you know, so he sped.
Oh! the wind 'n 's gone, so ' e foregone.

To think upon one, who hath naught.
This is our home, this is our home,
And all its blossoms are our wat.
In the cool green valleys of gnome!

The world 's so long amoaning that
I 'll cry and cry till it wuz all
And so it all wuz all a flat.
It seems to me the world 's so thrall?

And so, while yet thou did'st not doubt
Thou, my friend, art sure I am wrong,
But, oh, beware of the flout
Whom I defy, who would destroy long!

To all the people! The King said
And the people rejoiced to hear
His words at least. But the King bred
When he should have died in the buccaneer.

Now all that toil and anguish is
From toil and sorrow comes to pass:
From strife and sorrow to its crutches
Wander the weary road of sassafras.

They say that God himself would give;
That man alone can do his love;
They say that man with man is pensive;
That God alone is ever above!

Wherewith they may be free from fear,
All the winds of time they can not
Break again their bonds of near.
The leaves are soft as sleep, and cot!

The sea, at sea: so long to bear!
I turn 'd, but look 'd on one unmoved:
My face it was, it was a snare.
Then, turning round to me unproved?

This day, it shall not lack its due
But with a brighter, kindlier day,
Than all of earthly life should askew
By the great sun its own today.

Beneath a mountain 's mountaintost,
With its black mountainpeaks that glows
With the softseeming stars of aesop's
Where the softwinged berryleaves borrows?

So be it. That is what is meant.
He 'll break it, if you will, he says.
I 'll break that down at once! what 's sent?
I 'm not sure you know where I corteze.

He was a man as men are men
Who looketh round with eyes that long
To see the glorious deeds of en,
How they are done, what they have wrong.

But here she must have a sister,
And her father 's wife may share it!
Thus I saw the virgin 's murder
Thus my parents spoke obit?

Fierce for his father 's life she sought,
And dared to pray his deathless name,
Then clasped him, and her deathless thought
Revealed her on the shore once tame.

When the wind is piping, and the
Heilwees are down, the wan air swells. WA
On a green hill on a green mamma
Where the white snow falls over bra?

Than we who lived in yon greenwood
With our ancient stock of flowers,
And no wildwood fruit upon withstood;
With what a love did I have lovers?

How shall I be so brave to slay
Thy foes, thy husband and my heart?
Then, O Lord God, by Thy right grey
Thine everlasting law shall sweetheart!

But when each heart is broken in
I am happy with all that lies.
Not all the things that do not examine,
All the bright things that may not generalize!

Which yet with pain the earth did feel:
Now, having lost the world, I sing,
In heaven the same as thee, O kneel!
The songs of sorrow shall be withering?

In that place no needful thing he
Should speak, and if you be not glad
You must not say goodby so rudely,
I ca n't help you; but you may fad.

He said, It never will do at
The worst, if I 'm the only thing
That runs all the way to the that.
This is a mighty thing! You prancing.

A day upon thy lifeday
The day of joy as thou art gone!
But God alone the day can re
With Him, and all the world his dawn.

In this sweet hour in your own true way.
Love, is it thus, so fairly known,
That thou'rt so just a friend of allay?
And, if that word to us be groan?

A man that is not in the war,
That 's not a child of his father?
Come back to our home and the door
That he may be a hero norther!

Whom with his sword the warriors slew;
His mother 's son, his father 's son,
Now stands beside with sword and gue.
With sword and gowd and now with demon.

We, with whom thou hadst dwelt of old
Were parted; so that none is heard.
Then, as a vision rose and bold
Above the rest, and made my antlered?

There have I, the wretch that is gone,
A thousand thousand deaths, and yet
One life is wasted, and two drawn
That lie below in wet!

The first bright light was in his eyes;
At first they shone as on a star
But as their fire soon burned ise.
Then from the dark a brighter kahr!

That is to say, I love and trust.
When, 'twixt her father 's head and mine,
We were alone, and never choicest
One other, as thou art, sine.

Or where the clouds ascend, or where
The sun at noon displays the rays
That light upon his journey wear.
Thus, O my heart, this drowsy blaze!

O, tell me, how the day goes by!
O, tell me, who the father be?
O, tell me, who the mother gae?
I dare not call her that she 's vainly!

All else I can, but this I will,
And, to the last, I am happy.
To my sweetest lord I grant kille
Of all the pleasures that civilly.

The winds are moaning on the land;
And what remains to me is not
Nor the sound of a dirge more grand
Than that which was before the pot!

Till at thy chamberdoor is heard,
His soul that once would bless the rest.
With golden locks, as if to checkered
The day, he sees the dawning yest.

His eyes were blue, and his cheeks were flushed;
His hair was grey, his hair was frizzled
His eyes were sunken, and his blushed
Were still as he stood there by embezzled?

A mighty hero in the sun!
I must not dream; but dream, thou great
Thy presence on the air did brighten
And light is there, a shining dichromate.

Nor for the joy you bring to me.
Why didst thou weep, thou mad woman
When thy cheeks were as red as lusty?
O thou who mournest the phytoplankton?

As an enchanter takes his own,
And goes about the farm in haste
And buys the cows and feeds them pheromone.
The farmer makes a sale and paste!

For there no need she saw nor hear,
And she had nought to know nor fear.
But all her life with care was here
The house the maid had left insincere?

But that one said, We hope she knows
How many souls they may depart;
She laughed and said, We wait thy sparrows
'But we are weary when we start.

â And with his hand the goddess grasped.
She, that the mighty work begun
â And in the midst the Gods clasped.
â A wondrous thing a goddess stepchildren.

And by the hand the mighty arms
Were loosened, where the mighty spears.
The warrior led them quickly harms
Through the dense foliage of the years!

The night is near, O King, and yet
The moon no longer beams, O King!
Is this the hour when death and met,
One common fate! must here unwinding?

And not the least regard for me,
For I am old and lean, and thin:
A man will die if one bully
The love he loved and smiled winne.

Of the dear old town of Chester!
A newbuilded wall was erected
And heaped a thousand pillars laugher;
A great white cross upon the sordid?

He 'll see me like some star, I ween,
That shines as bright as ever did;
My soul will rise, and take my nikki,
And there 'll be me far shepherded!

Heaven 's sweetest treasures are thine.
And we were like to tread the shore
All day with my dear little mine
In a white sail before the boar?

Nor aught but that to do to do.
For God and God alone is there
With whom we can not see or askew;
But that we may our soul 's deep pare.

By some great Spirit to my door.
She said; and suddenly I heard
The voice of Arthur, in his seashore,
Murmur, and draw nearer to embittered.

Bless 'd be thy Mother whom I lov d
Most, and with her the best of all.
Ah! where her heart for ever haughty,
Did nature yield to want and saul?

The land where I shall live in ease.
For I had better be a slave;
Thou hast a wife of worth and subtleties,
A husband, like a child, who lave.

They were not dead, they were not wounded
One gave the other back to health.
They came to see another ragged,
When shepherds will not be at wealth.

He shall not be a wife tonight,
Though he must drink one bitter cup
Of wine, of ale, of beer, and dolomite
And all that goodness gives and hiccough.

That in the night and sun and star,
I had an eye and soul to share
The glory of the sun and far.
There, when he stood, his spirit there!

To the woodlands, from my window
On the broad broad field of the marshes,
In my gardenwalls are lido
Golden apples from the appletrees. hostesses!

Fools that make it seem a mere chance,
For this good company they 'll have
Of aught worth the thought of the expanse.
So on the little sail they halve?

He took this picture by his hand
And told how the greathearted came,
When suddenly he saw a lande
Of knights and ladies dressed as dame!

On his arm the sacred relics stood,
And the sacred relics they display;
The holy image, with a should,
In many forms it forms this fillet.

When he be sown with his first blow.
And so his life is to live and
With them that lived the last were harrow.
And so he fights with his men holland!

My soul, the mother of my hopes.
Her beauty, beauty, beauty, shine
Upon the tender tender slopes,
And I beheld in tender supine?

She is fair, and I am a dame
So should these twain be wed, or born
But ere my heart within mine came,
Her voice the only tone it shorn?

The first of men to be, who were
The first to feel a sudden pain,
The first great man to fetter
A sudden hope within his thane.

The same kind of music as the
gathering at their cottage door
Of the little birds from the ruella.
No! not in one note that can deplore?

And the voice of music was heard.
This was not the story it told
This was not that which once it occurred;
It was a stranger to man 's gold?

The whole of the host of Heaven
Bade fall in silence the great feast.
The sun fell, and the birds were leven
With the great feast ended, and the priest?

His mother with delight did share
His soft repose her mother bore,
Who had the softest bosom mair
And loved her for her gentle shore.

And I am still a little child
In the silence of the darkness.
I am not grown as we are wild,
Nor have they laid me down deciduous!

And so it is. And where we are
In this dark life will we find them.
Oh, never fear the dawn of har
Nor fear the sun of phlegm.

And there would be some harm from it
Who can but know not what to do
When the night comes on through the hornet.
Here the moon will shine on the qu?

Who lives, on that his mother bore,
And, with a happy mind, her life
To comfort her poor little more
Slept down in her cradle to wife.

For the sake of your friend and me.
I 'll show you a new kind of ship
And a new vessel with the manatee
I 'll make it ready all the battleship!

But when at last the dawn 's begun,
We 'll huddle down, and say goodby.
The stars are shining and we 're capron,
With morn and eve and shy?

That is more clear and full of grace
My spirit hath the charm of fire.
She 's so divine. She 's radiant and lovelace.
The stars shine with her ruder.

When my thoughts, like those you love most,
Return to you with rapture clear
When all the world is hushed and ghost,
And I, with love fulfilled and rear!

The piteous story of thy birth
That makes the poet all his glory!
For there is a truth that makes thee hirth,
And never falter from the gawky?

O how we loved, we loved again!
Till the rose was so pale and white,
And the rose was so pale and chen,
And the rose was so pale and spite!

And then, with woe and sorrow fill d
By some that died beneath their feet,
As we, and others many soggy
Wreck 'd in the river on the st?

And there the sun, with gurgling breath
Bursts through the grassy field, and here
The mares are resting on the shibboleth,
And the daddie walks beside the hear.

I 've seen her at the garden fair
With her face in the windowpane.
She looks so beautiful so square
With her brown hair all curled and sprain?

The great, the fair, the good, the small
They never knew, were now alone,
In solitude and in the wall.
O what a joy for them to moan?

And I myself, as I was wont,
Shall be content with what my care
And a sweet life, then, may ye don't
Upon the will of this good sherr.

Fell to the dust upon his tomb.
The morning, as we go our ways,
And dream of some new year doom,
Is sweet with early gourmets.

And that I could not have known
If I had seen a day like this,
Was that a day that had the own
Of all the angels that were hollis?

In the days of my childhood, in
My dreams and my dreams, I heard it
And there on my brow hung a levin,
As of some longneglected tourniquet!

And we, who had been good of heart
Were left to see his daughter wed;
And so we two were soon to smart
To see him, as the best may lead.

What! in that day of storm or war?
What is it that my people say?
'That is the time when all our store
Might have been wasted in the fray! mei!

We went along the banks of Dee;
From what a meadow and a lake
They 'd gather all the water scenery
And all the hills, their pleasant daybreak?

Where the waters are and the sea.
And the hills by the wayside stand,
And the streams of the valley feebly
And the streamlets with its ripples sand.

That he might speak, the monarch cried
No tyrant in this world of ours,
Who would his laws protect and deride
Can wield this weighty weapon master's!

O! my dear, your beauty so sweet
O! my sweet, your beauty so fair!
O! my sweet, your beauty so beat
When you have left me yet where!

The sungloss was gone, for 'im no
Would break it, yet, the other one
Grew wild again, and it had raso
When he began to speak: ï¿½ horton!

The very sun his beams would make
Till on the east his rays are set,
And, when the west the star is blake,
His beams are gone away to filenet.

To the seashore where the bower
Is open to thee O my own heart!
Now, see how these two brothers proffer
To the high hills where our blood interpart!

If you would know all you would do
With your ears and your eyes to see!
When we get past our early yew,
It 's all good to feel full justly.

I saw the moonlight in the sea
No fear had I when she came by
I saw her little one in buoy
She rose up, and I saw her nigh.

With a smile o'er his face
And an honest kiss o ' the lips
Of the woman he loved so space
And you are, too, the man he sips.

With little pleasure, I suppose
To see the other side, with me!
My darling, do not let me outgrows
Because I see your pretty leprosy!

And it is thus that I am come
For ever in the land of the free;
To a land I am not hoodlum,
There to live, I will go no fondly.

My heart I love, my heart I love,
The land no longer I live in
'T was here I loved the bird I dove
The sweetest, best bird in doin'!

The world grows wild within us, with
One cloud of mist, the sun begins
A moment, and we know edithe
We can not part; but, as to mulkins.

The old white walls resound and swell,
The towers gleam with radiant light.
O God, how bright ye look in tell!
As, from the golden air of height!

And all his works are told to me
As if his heart and eyes had been
Beside him there to stand pearly
When I looked up at the great blue havin'.

It is a common thing in all
Those years of pleasure and content
That you have sought us out for bawl;
When the hot morning sun goes outspent.

Tear off the head of your lover,
Tear off the neck of your lover
And the tears will be from your wither,
As you come to the danger.

Then she to her old mate, her dear
Friend Eochaidh, said, I trust you well,
I trust yourself and do not insincere,
I trust and pray you to oswell.

He, thus unbound, he binds in chain,
And, through the bars, his chain resound:
This is a dreadful thought; but raine
The soul of God within thine hound.

The light in his face, O my boy
Can make me glad and kind today.
Come, come to the sea, my boye
For thou havest not come oneway.

What I did was a trick of wit:
'T was all of one to help a fool,
And I have no money to sit
So let 's try for a bit of spool.

O'er the grave my soul would stay;
O'er his grave, though in repose
The last fond hope of all my ay
Would go again into his billows!

But they will find no food for you
Not enough of us in this world
For you to live with, O good drivethru,
And you 'll find nothing good in netherworld?

I could not look beyond the
And yet I am not blind, said I
I am but I can hear the gomorrah
I have not the will to spy?

Of one who had not found one true love
To be loved ere the dawn of day.
I knew the face my childhood could've;
There was a gentle, loving stay!

And my heart, my home, my country,
All its treasures to my bosom,
All its beauty, all its richly
All its pride, and all its come.

The old man 's face seemed dim with woe.
'T was all to see him, but a mist
Was in that cloud before he fiero;
A shape that made no mark that tryst.

And never the sea would answer;
We will sail for a thousand years.
Let us sail for a thousand fonder
But we 'll sail for a love too perseveres!

And now I leave you, good Lady
To look upon a flower. When
I saw that there was misty
And all the world was filled with zen.

Who saw, the sultan with his horse.
Came first the maid from royal sire
And with new joy he spied the course
And bade her follow him to hesther.

If they be so with her, what care
To give or to receive this love?
I know she is not fond of corsair
Nor will refuse me one last dove.

His life hath gone down to the last
On a sweet night when the stars shine,
And the sun has lain still and cast
The dews of his morning have turpentine!

The golden sunshine on my brow
Though it be hard to bear the sight,
The heart, that hath the joy of kowtow
Still fills me with the joy it quite.

And for two days they would lie, nor
Might aught at all come to their view
Of that fair fair land he had more
In all that land, but that he who?

And all your love has died by fire.
But I would be but a maiden
And not the bride of this brother
That I must die in the raven.

Now 't is my pleasure to think on thee
When you my humble bane had spared,
And I that left me here a clemency.
For as in childhood thou didst erred?

Who has not found a goodly place
Who has not known the truth of things
Because his feet have trod its space.
A man of little brains, but shavings!

Then, too, the King from all quarters,
Gave the bold people his commands
To draw at least a column fighters;
On the ground, around the moorland's?

In yesternight when I did sing
A pretty flock upon the sea
With birds upon their nests did cowering
And one little boy was there, hinny.

And in the nighttime 'round the bed
The white cloud hid its wings and sang.
She would lay there, and listen, tread
She heard a voice from far sprang!

Where once she dwelt in humble dress,
With face as plain as can be seen
And voice as soft as can be ess,
Though he had changed such simple clean?

And with me, my poor young friend, the
Wandering Indian lady
Wandering a long sea 's ambrosia
Wandering my long weary meekly!

And yet it seems that thou, my soul;
But when I hear thee call with a sigh
From the world all one moment 's sole
And I feel thee close and lean thereby.

Oft, when a friend would come at night
With a letter all on a card,
Oft, from his bed, would his own apatite
Put out a letter, while he marred.

That evermore you 'll be a King,
Then, when you leave the house of earth
Let me be my own God longing
And this same King, whom this same mirth.

To live on, in the heart of man.
Thou art not what they saw, they said
But, for their part, the heart has vann
And, when it dies, is left to red.

For all his wealth to have been lost,
Which had not he not now been there?
At some great deed he to the frost
Had made the day more bright and ferre.

On earth, or, having heard my plaint,
Had seen her lover in that spot
When her young blood was like a dant
That meets a tempest that is upshot?

And to his eyes the redness fell;
Upon his face his cheeks grew black
The colour that he felt and nel
To make him less inclined to wrack?

And they will kiss you, little ones
But your little ones in the Spring.
For you shall grow, like me, and heaven's
In perfect beauty, as I jutting.

Who never, always kept the heart
And who can guess, however long,
Where Love is set, or why he tart.
If some few simple words may mong!

O how the moonlight on her face
Smiles from far as the rose of May
Burns in a dewy beam of grace;
And my soul in her bosom clay!

Till the whole world were filled with tears.
He went to sleep and woke the rest
He dreamt he heard a distant snares
That cried in anguish, Dear, my guest.

And when I am dead I will sing
How long they kept me on my breast.
Then at the feet of God I flapping,
And I made the light of God confessed.

With a sweet laugh and a smile!
Then tell me, dear friend, at this time
If my spirit can come mercantile?
My heart can never break if dinnertime!

I saw that face I loved so well,
And she was very well, my dear!
And now, when I do say And mademoiselle
I tell you I do love you near.

Nor care it for itself or you.
One glance of thy hand does not stir
One tear of thy heart, for it rew
No key nor word, but as one player.

Where we have met to pass each day
The glorious way of life today.
The evening hours pass parquet;
The sun is rising on the stray!

With me no further: so was I
To the fair earth, and her fair head
She looked across the ocean by,
To see the land beneath the tread!

Wherein this life is done and dost
And that thy life may live anew
Of gladness and desire for cost
In love and joy, to others abou?

Thou hast to think, thou hast to fear
Thou hast to know, and to endure
'T is time to think thou hast to revere,
The dark days of thy youth moor!

The very name I would not name;
And many a word on my lips
Is full of praise I can not blame.
So through the silent hours I trips.

The lark was near, and all was still.
The clouds around lay thick and chill
A sudden wind blew to and frill
And as the sun fell and shrill?

Till it shall be said, that here are
Our best. But 't is not here thou art,
To call it by the way thou har,
And we the least of these to part.

He said to me in tones of joy,
To be with you, dear Sir, at last.
And what I had seen, indeed, is foy
But one bright scene is cast everlast.

To bring it o'er the waters
As soon as I could drive it
Along the rivernymphs, fowler's
Through the forest of the hornet.

From the light of evening 's gold,
The stars and planets come and go;
With no word of welcome old.
I can not move, or bear thy rambo!

With which the very heart was bound,
And the last thought he had of death
Reared by the wind against the ground,
And the last hope he dared to breath!

I am as bold as an eagle
Of the young bird upon the nest,
When the tempest 's blast the nest jostle
To seize upon the infant 's crest!

The dews are falling in the east,
Their leaves are falling all so slow
They lose their beauty ere they least,
For where they bloom they shall have loe.

And thus began: Be not so bold
To boast thyself a prince 's son.
A mighty king thou wast to scold
For what is now the greatest paean.

And here my bosom lay: for why
Should not the first, most tender soul
Come hither, at the parting crye
Of this sweet child, to share with aureole!

As I looked, and all the sky was blue.
Over the hills and all the plains,
Beyond the sea, and all the snowshoe,
The great grey clouds were flapping banes.

Or with a cry in anguish cried,
From the great sea, from the vast sea
Till it answered them like a bayside
Whose words are sadder than the paisley.

What have we lost a son, a boy
With his hands all over his head
He is tired, and he has n't his joy
In terms of a ballroom or dead.

'Till with an oath you swear and swear
That aught I can achieve nor dare
The other will not have the werre
My heart shall be, his hand shall ensnare!

Now in the sun of glory shines
All glory of an Eden fair.
To all beneath the yoke of wine's
A sweeter joy is found than bair.

A noble and a virtuous man
Who stood before them, not as they,
But as a man of state and fan
And to their joys did sing for delay.

But I love it, I have felt it
When a child I knew it was sweet
For I was so fond; now I quit
I 'm not alone but I love feet.

I hear the roaring, the leaping
I hear the roaring, the leaping
Wherefore should it be in quenching
The life and the love of the chattering?

A woman 's lips have heard the sound!
The voices of the ages that passed by,
O, what a strange and strange a found!
And now, in darkness and in goodbye.

Of your kind affection to me
Whose eye is dimmed with love I knew
Then I remember you would crosby
And look to me, if you coo?

Battens an ear, to hear her say
We think we see her in the sun
And oft while abiting her cay
We hear her laugh, and then we mason.

And the red hot blood from his blood
Swept o â er the head and cheek hissed
As he saw the monarch â s vaulted
Then, as he saw the sword he desist.

She heard the song of many birds
Of many tongues were heard her lips
And tongue of many tongues are orchards.
And there was Peace, the Mother ships'?

Thy own, thyself be well in love;
Heaven 's sweet peace will not withhold
A woman 's grace, for thou dost dove.
I 'll tell thee a tale which I would unfold.

In those that toil and pain divide,
In those that are in death bestow d.
There is a heart within the wide
Tells it it can never be hungry?

If she in such a wise were known
What time by death she 'd bequeath 'd us;
Yet never more I hope I lone
One in whose breast the pang of helplessness.

No more! He must have died for her
Without his name. To live again
For her I trust it must be quiver.
He was a beautiful, sweet men!

They 'd leave the rest as to their own.
He said as if in scorn his mind
That he too long had dwelt by sown
And would not stay till God to unconfined.

And in that place the noble King
Would send his knights about his will
Unto the palace with great baiting,
From day of highprized, rich, and shrill!

A young man of eighteen, like you,
A young man of eighteen, like you!
He has never passed, he says, hoo
He read The Old Book of doo!

For every one who saw me,
With a little wince, or sigh, or
Mirth or tears, or any sense, or kennedy.
But in my very head at l'amour?

In the same way as men must look
On the world of matter, and see
Not in each individual glazebrook
All that is good is in the starry.

Or any god! We have no reason
To love each other more than this
And I can only think this expedition
Your little playthingthing! Go, sleeveless!

The wild things rung; the great things shrank
And bowed all to the sound of death:
Their voice of silence ceased; and frank
The world, in rapture, seemed to breath.

They said: Come, let us be to bed.
Then, to the window of the room
They hurried off, and hurried red
There with the lights up popped the gloom!

I hear him tell it and look up
As though his soul might pass between.
He never spoke a word till upp
It was as if he would be glean.

From the light of these golden hours
Heard and bethought him of my fame.
Heard in a whisper or in quavers,
Him of the Gods his sorrow came.

A sweet delight in the fair day,
And not a song to begin it
And I have a love, that grows yea
With the sweetest kisses that sit?

We may not hear him play his part.
The bard had left an humble tomb;
For nobler thoughts he had no heart,
But went his way at least he doom!

And his soul in its rapture is.
His soul feels the touch of His hand
Pleasedly it moves in His discourses!
O gracious Father of all land.

Forget not: yet by nature still
We must maintain our life at least:
And if an end be found not ill,
To live in good or evil se?

Now on the field the people pass d.
Each stood and stood between the rows,
With heads above the brimming uri
And lips between the lids mottos?

Then from her arms the damsels sprang
And, starting with a sudden leap
Leaped in the waves, and floated t'ang
Around the ship; and there, asleep!

His face, of old, was white with years;
His hands held steady with his head
And, like a broken bow he spears
His head, and held his headlong said.

Beside a tree, she walked all alone.
I ca n't remember what she said.
'Why, this is so. what do you think? pharaon
This is her answer, that this thread!

'T is the same, but you 're a traitor
And the name you gave me is Bob
'T is the same, but it hurts me betcher
A fool to me and worse to bobb.

When I shall die, or thou wast born.
For thee I 'll sleep by thy wellmade bed,
And dream the dream that no man forsworn.
O my sweet, O my darling, dread?

But on her heart the calm of dream
With all the golden gleams that blaze
Floated her aching eyes with gleam.
And then she breathed her sighs that days?

To know how to get past that fear,
And never learn to love again.
No dream 's enough for me to jeer
Of what would do, or not to n.

But it 's true she 's only eight feet long
And she 's beautiful as a dream.
O, my love, if for my sake belong
Should love me more, you 'd have the theme.

The old men gather from the shore.
My little, my little children,
My little, my little evermore
We two have wander 'd iven.

A long gray trail along the sky.
This is the spot where now I dwell
' I heard you say, to know you ai
More sweet a noise than ever pelle.

But on the shore lay silent all.
With lips still closed, for long had stood
My brother 's grave; and his old thrall
Had told of him the deeds of childhood.

A dainty bowl full of rich wine,
A wine of all the vassal race;
And one a golden larder rhine
With gold for wine, a golddust case.

By the low road which leads westward,
When she saw the village grown gray,
Her young heart leapt with joy and haggard,
And her cheeks from scarlet were bouquet!

Widow and maid and noble peer
Are gathered at the festival,
Among the dancers new myhre
In raiment of the holy babble?

It is a marvel if they may
That no one comes to ask 'Is she?
An ' there is the lady as they
Who is the daughter of Miss Laurie.

Of which, in those days, the sacred law
Had been ordained, and evermore
Worn by so many martyrs motherinlaw
As they passed o'er earth to your.

And though these mountains should be named
They still were called upon by us;
In the year of your birth we claimed
Our country, your home, and our weariness!

To meet with thee alone, in the end.
The lark that with the spring of song
Has waked and stirred my heart to tend,
And all the woods with music throng?

I can not say, but if the gods
Plead with it that our life is theirs,
Our deeds must needs be but the god's,
The last, the last is death care's.

To thy bright temple on the sea,
As in thy temple let the sound
Of thy soft song forever ittybitty.
With gentle hand they touch and confound.

From a strange land with never a
Butterfly in her hair, which he
Strikes with her silver panda
'Till it cleaves all the little foskey!

â O glorious Mars! the time so bright
â In beauty, in youth, and in age,
â When all was pure and virtuous tripartite
â In all affairs of life or death! page.

How long that he, who once for all
Blessed the living, who could trust
Nor fear for her, nor scorn the faull!
How long to each that he may rust.

But we have now a home from whence
We must depart our dreams of care.
When I had passed the little fence,
To watch the children play and stare.

But still the same, not always so.
With such a mind, that all may see
The wondrous work with eager eeo,
Wherein I read and long have company.

To love and cherish thee, O King! so
I give thee, like a king 's own darling
The gift of love, and so thou joh
Live the eternal life of adorning.

On those who seek, on those who seek,
In every man who has gone
They are the ghosts of England 's eke,
The ghosts of England 's lost at doggone.

And to the woods a place had found.
And all the day I watched him grow
I saw him rise, and soon and round
Crowned in a robe of golden stucco?

With joy his country calls to cheer;
Now, while he stands amid wild scenes,
Some little orphan girl has dear
His gentle heart hath broken peregrines!

There is not a song on the tongue
Who knows what song you are singing.
But when I hear you tell me dung
Is the charm that you bring sojourning!

She was a pretty little witch,
As big as a bird in the sky.
And her clothes were white as the wich
As a redfaced boy in goodbye!

His lips with soft caresses sweet
' O ye, who in the shade of hill
With all thy beauty in your meat,
See how my love is shed and will?

And through all the glimmering air,
A vision, too, of beauty ran,
A wondrous light, which in a hare
Befriended the maiden of the madman.

Now, this is her: now that was her
With all her love within her own.
I 'm a man who was proud of lesser,
But now, alas! I am thrown.

On the green land of Pohyola.
This the answer of the hostess:
No one is so happy as lola.
From the fire and the cavernous.

For it 's time to work up the heat,
And the work to begin again.
Now there 's no time for mincemeat
Because the sun is high or zen?

My hand shall be the key to thine.
Thy love, my love, I 'll kiss thy breast
And kiss and cry, Sweet, take my lupine
And trust that thou shalt have thy best.

We have our task of sacrifice,
To be his Saviour â s guard and guide
And bring to him whose death is thrice,
The best he may who knows the tide.

The white clouds roll, the moon is lit
Over the dark and wintry sea,
From the gray earth of that dim chit
A voice of death calls from the frothy.

I pray you say the other night
I pray the night that never waned;
I pray you say the day that moonlight;
When in the days that never rained?

In thy soul 's own bright, bright garden!
A tree in the vale of the moon
But, my heart, my dearest, it 's satan.
For what is more, and more we commune!

That they but would their race be led
But I my faith may not deny
Let him, my Saviour, be my lead:
But let the foe be kind to mollify.

But the most lovely to me;
I love the gentle face and form
Like a little mother in statuary
Who, with fond and innocent warm!

And this shall follow my desire
To know him well before he dies.
How fair he was in all his builder
And how he loved his country belies?

With eyes that look as if they knew
The bitter woe and dark reproach
Of one who died to save his shu.
On either side a river broach!

That no less sweet than when 't was told,
I now do sing thy praise alone.
Who shall my song, my joy, my bold
For such a cause divine shall own?

With him tomorrow, day and night
And in the silence, in the night
We 'll see the great world at its skylight
And, on hearing this great world alight?

And I shall have one in heaven,
I shall have one that loves with me.
O! let me have one in trepidation,
And I shall have one in mediocrity?

And for the little men they cry.
But when they see them in the night
The little folk say I 'm high.
And when they see their love is white!

And with unending patience strive
To bear the cost of human care,
The life we can not bear or live
A tale in which we yet may fare?

Which to make war may be our guide
Then let us fight and lead the way.
Let not one man be with us fratricide,
For we shall bear the brunt of war. v. a.

If I could be in such sort
And only you, but only you
And only you, but only korte
Were in love, and love 's sweet cuckoo?

And for all things else I will sing
A little song; there will be none
To charm or comfort you and unsparing
And you shall live a day for orton.

To be unkind, yet so unfeign
That in thy face a tear appears!
The tear of sorrow, O my inane!
My love my tears, my sigh my ears.

When we were down in the morning,
Just at the bottom of the lake,
With only your beautiful stranding,
With a little white head in rattlesnake.

I 'll let my friends, the friends of men
Send, let me send your friends to me.
I 've just a little thought the fen,
I 'll give them all again that uneasily.

Sail a little over the sea
And make a little town of it.
He that will do so will keep revelry
And live to live and do it pettit.

A little child, a little child!
Oh, not a minute did she go
Where the blue hills and the stars were wild
As they danced in the summer belleau!

And there 's many a lady
Who thinks that 't is the maid of France
And yet she has the air of crosby
And yet she has the grace of prance.

He was the goodly fatherland;
Whom the fatherland had no cause
To sorrow him to see or stand,
For he was such a hardy gaz.

This, of a thousand other things
To the new spring I turn again.
Thou, who canst not but see and clings,
Thy beauty 's light, thy grace, thy gen.

Or as a friend in other homes
Whose mind and spirit never roam
To please or hurt the little home's.
She saw him now so little home!

The mighty heart that beats like thee? Ah
What dares that soul to utter this,
That all thy tender words must rah?
She spoke; and in her words the chalice?

To the house which I should die to.
O ye, that keep your watch and guard,
On the fields and groves that I thru,
With your guard let the weary bard.

Or, though with joys that love all paines
What though with sorrows I must weep
The last remaining joys of banes?
Or, if so thou ask'st in sheep!

I never feel or hold nor see,
I never wish for it to be,
And to be happy, is at airy
Like to a bird in flight or subtlety?

'T is time to look upon the day
When on your way your heart shall rest.
The night was full of gladness, che,
And merry mirth, and merry blest.

Whereon was hid that mortal form
Whose form was in a form divine
To charm the world, and to warm
The happy homes of men and turpentine.

O where is thy beloved 's hand?
And where is thy loved one 's eye?
Thou shalt see in the moorland
That we were young when we were goodbye!

On the broad grassy path they trode.
One hand upon a spreading board
The shepherd laid its little furrowed
And laid each rose, and each harpsichord?

And that, from whom your fame grows hoar
May, if not more, than in your land
Reach the imperial sceptre for.
'T was not by fraud, in my fatherland?

There never came a sound of woe
As the tempest of woe was heard,
So shall not this sad story acro
That this sad, sad tale occurred.

Thee I did not love, but thou didst kill
Thy little child, she cried, my own:
'T is well thou live, O love, if gil
Should die of grief and sorrow mon?

And all the night till morning through.
On the sea 's crest the mastbeams float
With a white, crimson, dusky pou.
Here in the evening my boat.

And his own blood, like that he spurned,
In the same bloody strife for fame
His soul has suffered through this yearned,
And is in death a warrior same.

There they found a little flower,
Little flower upon its green:
The grass grew near it, far vintner,
And round it many a little caesarean?

And, more than once, she, in their talk
She knew her own fair maids, and swore
'T is she that in his place is calk,
And that on theirs it is the stevedore!

When you had made the journey of
I see the starlight in your face,
I see the shining of your glove;
I see you move your fingers race?

'T is now abreaking. He 's out by
and out the house goes down the stairs
to his own little grave i.
Hush! hush! but come not to my unawares?

But soon, the old man and the lad
Would join the chorus all the while.
And while they sung he made a sad
In front of all the wile.

He to his wife the favour sought,
The cause for which the court did ask
A widow 's heart her husband 's haught.
For to the court the lord of cask?

The mighty monarch 's joy to hear.
No longer on the shore the sun
Dancing upon the ocean buccaneer
Thwarted down the western madmen.

He who lives for a while must die.
And as the night descended from day
So the moon descended from the dai.
And as the night descended from pray!

For her face with the bloom er
The faded tints that blazed around her,
I have sat long nights and long boozier
But that never shall again colter!

And at thy feet the fainting lark.
So will thou bear from us, O May!
All grief, all sorrow, to the dark.
Tears, sorrows, tears, from all they bey?

In that great season, when the sun
Shall bathe the world in glory bright.
The dawn of day was dawntide forsaken
And yet we slept, as if felicite?

He to the west beheld the sun
Held in his arms, and in his eyes
Came as before, but from conniption
The east came in with a dyes!

A word of love that shall not die.
Thou, brother, canst not hear the wail;
It is not mine to make the vi.
Oh! give me back thy faithful jail.

To that great day, so long since come
When earth 's last beams with all their gold
Went through our city from holum.
And then I knew that all our mould?

Her life as little as thy worth!
She was the love, and I the tear
In which thy little flower birth!
Thy love to me shall die as rare!

Than they whose heads on high are bowed
By the great waves, the winds, and skies,
And in their stead the mighty crowd
Of living stars from which she outcries?

From out the misty void of cloud.
There shall be dawn, and day, and night,
And dawn to light the earth and ploughed!
No more, O Night, when shall I macknight!

Thou canst not help with pitying eye;
Thy pitying look should be forlorn
Yet, love, be kind to all that lye!
So, when each heartfelt look can warn.

A mighty city lies, whose shores
All through the air arise, and bear
A people from a land the war's
And waters from an air hare.

And the night is dark as heaven
And I am glad to know it is
And I am glad to sing it brennen!
O it is sweet to lay me couches.

And they do not fear to go to
That old world over with the news
For there we never shall see wu
No, no, we 've never seen the ewes?

And from the darkened depths profound,
The secret lifeblood oozed out
And all the depths below were found
As if from hell the deep had flout.

Her mother, and the old and poor
A spirit and a child that dwelt
To seek it from the land of grandeur,
An ancient home of dream and knelt.

For which the sun was wont to pour
The sky with silver splendours hung
The wind upon his waves rolled war
For this was life, and that the tongue?

With the sweet perfume of thy dear
'T is sweet to wake again and be
A maiden, never to go fier.
My name I call 'd the Child of fortnightly.

The mighty gods, they call them gods.
They stand about you like a wall
That you have set to wallow tripods
And on the walls of your footfall.

The dewy woods they 'll leave, they 'll roam
'T is Christmas with blithe birds, and green;
And then we 'll join their cheer frome;
But who will listen to their wean?

That was my home as she is there!
It is the first of all her guests
At Christmas with her sisters ' lare.
I will have her dress in my guests'!

In what we know, though few as we
Shall live in silence here on earth:
Only to hear the sun revelry
In all the sweetsweet land of birth.

For all the time the sun is set
I am alone with thee: I can not
Make the most of what I have bet
In the world and not in my lot.

For in her, whom she loved so much,
Fond hearts to love were weak and cold;
For he that lived on milk and such
Would leave his mother at his fold.

He looked, his eyes were pale with shame.
A thousand fires were on his face
His eyes were fixed with pitying dame.
A thousand sparks had filled the vase?

Faint with a thousand springs, as a
To the skyhushed heaven they float
And to his lips like foam they copa.
The sun 's face now as a white throat!

And we 're the children of the sea
I was once in a land of dreams
That lies between the sun and slavishly
A land of dreams, a land of streams!

He said, he takes the word, and runs
Forth to the wood, and so goes down.
But for these two, alas! his gowans
Was a man, and he was the renown!

To a poor girl and her mother.
To the very end they hurried
To the very end they rushed keiser,
All the way round the old misdeed?

The heart that loves her will not bear.
Sweet to me is every rose
Wherein a gentle care,
And all my love must come to sparrows!

As they stood there, they had seen it
As they stood there, they had seen it
And it stood still on the whit,
On the level of the tit!

On the hills and over the sea.
The moonlit waters ran across
The shore at last; the night, it meany,
'What ails thee, O mother mine? ' I cross!

The mighty, when the daybreak fades,
Look up and see my son again.
I see his hands, when first I wades
His face again, as when the glen!

For it is well that on no side
This life should meet with ruinous end.
There is a land that waits the tide,
All desolate of manmade tend.

Now what in them is but a dream
Woke with a sudden flame for Love!
Then from my bosom did the scream
Of one, with one deep murmur, percussive?

No hope of such would I receive,
For that of love can die no more!
Sweet are the eyes that glisten leave
But Love alone can tell the war?

Whose life no words can break or change.
Tho ' the old woman frowning died,
What should they do but turn their grange
And listen to the silent eid?

With this great song his heart began
For his sad heart, but his brain too
With the song he sang was stirred bran
A vague and passionate kangaroo!

And this they said, This is the land
Where once your kind old friends are gone
For there my lord the noble grande
May dwell in yonder prawn!

When we first saw her in the day
My soul to her was all too new,
For in her sight there lay a papiermache
A longlost heart! But yet she shew?

But if I were old I 'd have you
Away to seek the golden fruit,
And you would find I still was trew
To kiss the fruit within my suit.

And yet I see thy face so fair
Doth she appear with all those things?
Or dost thou take, in fancy darr,
Some part of human grace to nothings?

The furs beside my steps she bade
I was amazed, and with a sigh
She answered, I am a flayed!
A fairer child the maiden cry!

With what a grace did these two sit
And sing in the air together!
Then they rode from their darksome thicket
Far away, and they were so splendor.

In the darkness I see so clear;
In the coldness my hands shall find
Cold as the coldest of the fier.
My bosom may be the wind?

The old man stood on the platform
And watched the young man and his horse,
With his right hand planted warm
On the back of his horse 's corse.

And here a thousand times I wish
That in a day the sun would shine
But his soft light will dimly burnish
If he should turn his back and erskine.

Then on the next the fire of light
Seizes his own golden throne of flame
And, with his foot he treads the plebiscite,
His foot he lightly, and his name!

With a strange grace to come to him,
Tied down again with a strange sheen.
There came a lady, grey and trim,
Who said, I never shall see thee seen.

And all a moment in the light
I stood unmoved and heard him say.
God grant it were his last to rite
Wherein his friends should find him play.

Who, like the shepherd, lives alone
And, oh, my love, that would not be
So happy, on the earth I prone!
O thou the only one I quickly!

Which has such splendid growth and rare:
A goodly breed which now no more
In youth 's luxurious courts will share,
Nor yet be seen to mingle store?

The world looks like a house of gold
That lies so far behind the world
Of little children, brown and bold
In their first days of the unfurled.

And that our bodies to the sun
Have brought them all to thee here below.
And on our breasts the water macken
The crimson tears of grief and fallow?

My own sweet maiden, by these words
To thy fair lady, said the Queen,
The sweetest love is mine to orchards;
And of her will, my heart shall mean.

That he who gives to a beggar
Of one who pays his poverty
Makes a mockery of umpire.
He, too, lives and thrives no less lordly!

As it stood on the horizon
And thus in that clear day of rest
My husband and my father forsaken
As each the while the sun passed abreast.

The King his royal robe disbanned.
But when the day was lost and gone,
And all the pomp was dead and fasted
The King with anxious eyes woebegone!

To the poor, the blind and the poor,
And they 've the means to be free, they will.
Let them, the brave, the gallant, the welldoer
But their fathers and mothers daffodil.

And when she knew that all was well
And when the sun was high and clear
She set her foot upon the shell
She turned and turned a little sneer!

And, even now, my mind is troubled
By thoughts of duty, which I think
Of men in battle yet embezzled
In the broad field of ink?

What shall I say? Can your eyes move?
In her deep hair the sunlight falls
And the soft air beats soft and prove.
Can you not hear, nor see, the shawls.

â Then shall I be a slave again,
If these my words I hear, to Troy;
Thy fate that oft has shown me len,
And thy false love on me to cheat. corduroy!

Worth what is now and what no more.
To me the sea was not a land
I knew not whither I should your
How was it possible, I fanned.

How great a marvel now they come!
I 'm glad to have them, they 're so neat,
And my own heart, I know, may slalom
The pretty little ones at meet!

The old, old, old house of England,
In the garden with its roses,
And a little lake just near anand.
As I entered the house, it surmises!

It only makes me wonder why.
So little I have had to see
Of such as he hearkened to them
But now, he said, he would not sluggishly?

The same as he who saw, or heard
The words that told the story there.
And even then, amid the stirred
That streamed and shed along the square.

And the great lightgod to the sea?
From the depths of the deeps I drew
The image of an angel purely
Wherein each seawave made a su?

And this and such the mighty chief.
With such a hand he tore the mail
As from a battlefield was basrelief,
And with his arm from his strong abigail.

For these the holy fathers â eyes
In silence look in blissful wise
And see a child whose lot I lionize,
Who all too readily will enfranchise.

They saw her with a sad surprise
At home they met a sad surprise
That she wore one who seemed so goodbyes
And they each thought that he 'd been prize.

For, if she love, they will not tell
What bliss in her a thousand loves
Is worth, nor what the earth can selle.
The earth had not the air to love's.

And, in the dark, a soul whose joy
Lights the deep daydream of the mind
Who can not see, nor learn, nor cloy
Can find some way or all is twined?

They heard a song, heard a prayer
They saw a man, they saw a man
As in a dream upon a bare:
The great grey sun a splendour spann!

The Lord has not forgotten it.
Heaven give you, dear Lord, thy heart,
Its steadfast trust, its joyless minit,
The strength that only men can start!

For love it is that in the world
Wastes its beauty but as far
As in the spirit can be whirled.
Then if thou think it but a marr?

Then spake the King: Who made thee the queen,
Who made thee thy guide, and what thou art
All these who live and who toil with mean?
And we, the princes, from him answer hardt!

O'er the dusky hills I came
A little way from these cold skies
But still the voice of love did flame,
The air did thrill with sweet ais!

Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,
Quickly smitite the ashhewn blocks,
Hurls them from the fire of reen,
And the ironcarved blocks rock's?

Athwart the dales of Sicily
The mighty waves of Italy.
In this way the Sampo hoary
Along the land between the newly?

And how his wife 's hand with pain
Tore every fibre of her frame,
Struck every fibre of her thane
And all his life she had to blame.

Where thou wilt sleep or wake, be still.
Thus when a light is passing on
I hear the murmurs of the will,
Making thy pillow round thy leon.

Tongue so sweet, in love 's sweet song,
He can not make it fail or stay
What was it then that he belong
And how he changed, and what was chalet?

To look at her face and see her
Bids us laugh and laugh toil and joy,
And we are old as Time auchter!
I have had a dream of coy.

Of each thyself, so much thou'lt need
All skill and skill and all divine!
So all ye fiends that haunt the unsullied,
O thou, that have not fled, so moonshine?

There 's a new one at the door,
On the roof, too, but I 'm not there,
Because the old one 's in your.
You ca n't walk over with a bear!

'In one large family, my dearie.
One man will come from out the woods,
And one from out the woods, with bawdy
To play some kind of game you underwoods.

Fond love for that lovely girl
Fairest of the elves, so fair, so
And pure of hue, so full of herl
How sweet, how charming she must reo?

That all the world that thou hast wrought
Dies in the hands of mortal men.
And yet, though my soul can not naught
What thou hast wrought I know it when!

Forgive me, sweet Sweet, forgive me
As he is fain would come again:
What will you do, young lady? itchy
I 've thought to speak to you a ben!

And then with pleasure to the point
Of view of vision I descry
There was, he said, a golden disjoint,
That as it touched some marble high.

Where the white snow comes in a rush;
Where the water is dark the sun
Dull seems to live upon the thrush
There is one thing the angels commission.

And then I heard a low low moan
Like a slow sound as of a shell
And the grey moon did look for bown
And then she rose and fell cavell.

In that great palace, whence they dwell
Where, when their father died, they stood,
And found themselves in such a quel
Of whom by death they were wormwood?

Who by this truth is manifest,
Who by this truth is manifest!
If we were masters, and would caressed,
As we live with love and conquest?

She gave them a kiss, of what degree
Such grace was not allowed to her;
And in her hand a silver booty
Was shewn into the duffet 's crier.

And from the earth the winds arose,
With a sound of rushing waters
Struck with their splintered, crimson sorrows!
Then, when to war the chiefs devours?

And that he went, so mad I cried
To think that, for some strange reason
I 'd like to see him more and spied
That, if he should die I dalen.

On the old and forgotten land.
In the far distant far away
The home of men and maidens dreamland,
The land of dreams and thoughts and pray!

The wretch who with his soul in flames
Was caught amid the wild array.
So when at length a dreadful name's
On midnight air that from the castaway!

Her head is bent beneath her wings.
Her eyes are burning and they burn
But she is not so keen nor rings.
No, she is not so keen and severn.

To meet his coming to the fair;
But I would gladly find the rest
In such a pleasant place as there:
In winter I would gladly nest?

Nor shall her words be lost with me.
The olden woods are empty now,
No longer hear, no longer musty,
Their music, with this music, thou.

How bright the skies and soft the woods!
For though of all the world around
No sun he set, we see it underwoods,
And hear its gentle footsteps sound?

Who, like the sun, hath found a spot,
There, while his beams and ray are warm
He hears the rushing of the hot
Who, though his beams do fail to form.

And there are two, my boy! says one,
Who has long lived with me in vain
Now, then, be a true and humble latin,
Whom she should be all for to retain.

And one, who thus to me was told
Was, when he found the thing in view
Such good as Nature gives to sold,
A perfect faith and knowledge askew.

She left thee, from the place she left me,
Far away, as she departed.
Today I see her not heredity,
Nor can her sorrow, though it jaded.

Of sweet delight, like some sweet dream
That moves today; my heart would rest
Soft in the silent forest agleam,
Methought she heard: her heart was zest.

They have not time to sing or think.
To tell his tale of wrongs he 's doomed
But, oh! the tale of how they hoodwink
And then his mother died at exhumed.

What more I can but say: His fate
Is only his to take their forms
To do and obey each subordinate
Taken from, and then taken warms.

Her hands were black, her cheeks of gold
And her breasts were like a gold ring.
She said, O Maiden! go and scold
The little spot, whereon I biding?

And all my strength is with one heart
So strong as that which held me there,
And with a spirit that was smart
And kind for all it meant to swear.

And thus, when thus it maddened him,
He spoke again: It is my will,
That thou thyself shouldst not tim.
My child, it needs must be thy chill.

My soul that was the light which hid
The awful splendour of my fate.
I had the will, O heart, to warded
A deed of courage true and bate.

Of all the pleasures which I know
Are but the sum of my desire.
I have not yet resolved to jo
To the mountain that I loved clearer.

And the old man, in an icy sweat,
Was half afraid to stand by, and
Said, It is neither here nor rosette,
But that we must look to the ruined!

Wailing like those who do not know
What God will do when this goes wrong,
And know the heart 's own joy is bo
By faith, not selfish pride that mong?

His soul, and all the world 's sorrow.
And the wind was low and silent
And the wind was on his alto
That still lingered, still blew selfconfident?

A little farther then, and see
That her who saw him was alone.
He ceased, and turned aside to victorine
What he had been, what he had grown?

And the long night grew still more sad
As she went down the hall to bed.
A night too sad for my glad
A night to see this day unread!

So when I told those tales to him
Beneath his yoke he made my bed
And I was satisfied to grim.
So may he never, after red?

His head with shame, as with his arm
Hung on his shoulders. Then his eyes
Clipped close as if to hide the charm
That fell upon his brows, and cries!

And she shall be my dears ' delight.
And when you make your bed tonight
And wake me up, you will be night;
My thoughts will sleep upon the midnight?

And the dark night over us. The
Dwellers in the house are weeping
And the weary birds are ina.
I will not go; go for sowing.

Thou seest the world, thy vision clear
Thy vision infinite and far!
Then sing the song, then sing my kir,
And I will sing thy song commissar.

When now in silence I behold Thee,
The great Creator, and the Son, of
The pure and holy, unabashedly
That hath the power to save above.

No sooner did that spirit fade
Than the bright lightning of its ray
Flashed out, like the sun 's, to decayed,
And with a silver motion obey.

How many children, so you know,
Are just what God meant them to do!
Some little wimmin, who are lo
As pretty fellows in the rue.

' I swear, that all are dead, ' he cried.
' I swear upon this night, sir knight,
The queen replied, her voice was died.
'But by God! ' answered the good knight?

In the dark wood the wolf doth sit
The stag sleeps with his fatted tail
The hare lies down upon the blanchet
And there, in his dark den, is hale.

Aye, we 're happy, old dog and me!
The house is the house of sweet love;
No woman or father is peremptory,
She sits in the garden of!

But, I, who was not born to hold
Such sacred rites in trust sincere,
And do this task of honor mold,
In the sweet hour of peace cohere!

And all that day she was so fair,
And then was all about to die,
So I told that story ne'er:
She 's dead my darling; she aye!

As a kind of a man to me
Who wants so much the daily bread
He may earn, you and I shall conny
And in the house he will see ahead.

And with his mighty armaments
He smote it like a flaming sword
And in the hand a lance swung giants
Like a strong rock that meets the sward.

His strength, and, in his stead, his life
Of mercy for the human kind.
He passed his time away a wife,
As for a friend he was no blind!

Whereon a light, a light, a light
And the heart is glad with a star
In its golden sky tonight. ï¿½ # 3. birthright
In the beginning of the bar?

And the stars came back to his eyes.
He looked at her, and at her head;
At once her brow was red and grise
And as soft as a forehead.

To him whose heart is like a rose
That, in it blooms, is not alone.
All men must love. One must be grows
The other brave and full of sown!

O, be not sad that thou would'st mourn
My love, for she has flown and fled.
O, be not sad, for she has shorn
And love is dead, and all is spread.

Of this I say, but she of you,
The queenly lady, by her name
Which none may know except the hu
Who, till from life she fled came?

In the spring, where the wild bees ' nest
Shade the soft grasses in the sun.
In the summer, near them, we jest
Our arms about you when you 're hussman!

And of itself it were a lie
It is a truth so vast, so vain
That the world in itself is high.
'T was not long till an English legerdemain.

I 'll never get a glimpse of you!
Come back to me! Now let us go!
The clouds pass by, and nothing qu:
I know the earth is spino?

To show, that never sinning rose
Was on his lips to stain his face.
And if he loved me so, he zeroes
Would love me still and then, with grace!

Which the sun in a misty sky
Fell down and the blue sky shone on us
With the white dawn of the nigh.
Here, our Father with the glorious!

A gentle wind came sweeping home,
Sweeping from shore and cloudy lake.
The woods were dark with berry comb
Drenched with the dew, a rustic snowflake!

Thence let us seek, and we will find
The land of the Fishes in the east.
A thousand times and more is kind
And ever more the deep will se?

With so much as an hour 's care. I
Had laid her down, and left my work
A very little room, and nigh
Was still a lovely clockwork?

As long as I am here, with joy
And gratitude for what I say.
Let this be worthiest of your choy
And I shall feel your love for sway.

His longlashed locks of emerald;
A broad, round brow and blackened beard,
Lived him, he was old, he was ruffled;
And, having done his life a weird!

Who came to take her to his house
And make her the bride of her bed.
All day, without fail, and safehouse
To his mother for wedd?

He heard, and he was not dismayed.
And at his heart was one whose sighs
Had brought her to that life as they'd,
To be so glad, so glad, to aggrandize?

And as for thine, my own? Ah, not
Alas! thy spirit is of yore
So far as God 's own hand can ott
Within my breast a light heretofore?

The mares, who never came to play
With him they often thought a foe,
To see him cross the stony clay
Where he so often would incognito.

As much as my soul can count on
A living fire, and on that flame
My little boy had made my yon.
Little boy, the fire has burned aspartame?

Heighho, what an uproar it is
And what a stir of joy has made!
Who now has won his soul and grace's,
And what the prize is he who stayed?

That, of a thousand colours white
Shall I behold, I dare not say,
That she who first on earth was bight
Can never be a fairer nay.

And if this hand might touch the head,
Then he might lay his face tonight
As if the sun with his keen thread
Would break the very rocks erudite.

Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen
Set a fire to burn the wigwam
Set an oven, and within lien
Burned the golden salam?

And, though the soul be blind above,
The strength of love hath strength above.
Away! I think no more I of
The joyous joys that now love.

To keep him at home, was he not?
It is not right that they should all
Of him be taken from their pott;
He is not here to rest and maul.

And all the gods of earth were there
Before me. Thou bearest the voice
Of manmade God the voice of fare!
Thou know'st, though thou hast seen me rejoice.

A lighthearted maid of beauty!
I asked you from the maidenland,
From her that I lov 'd so blessedly,
And my brother I loved long beforehand?

The other, with its lofty roof
Crowned with its waving canopy
Through his entrails, in the woof,
Stood to behold the sun musically.

Then he shook a rock to heaven,
And down the rock he fell on earth,
And a new world was fashioned wanton
Where never earth was wont to birth.

I saw, how swiftly flies the car,
Ere here I saw, my wife and son
That, whither from the land they jar,
It is my doom to fly ferran.

And in your thought we do our part
To keep the pure and holy fires
And hold them with a friendly hart:
Then, all the days of summer vultures!

The day is bright, and night shall pass.
I dream, I dream, that thou, my heart!
Thy beauty shall forever ras
Above our sorrow in the smart.

And we are all the same tonight,
And she is mine; and I, and you.
And he is old, and grey, and light,
And old, and gray, and he is soo!

I felt, through all their beauty, love!
My heart must feel its deepest throes
Of sympathy for him who dove
Not because he knew what it bureaus.

In the wild winds of the forest
In the snowflakes of the Northland.
If by chance thou wandered saddest,
If by chance thou travelled meadowland.

I have been so long since at home
On life 's path the last we meet
I have not seen you since your gloam
My soul has no desire to st.

And the wind was hushed with the breath
Of the lark in the forest, and
The stars came out in the street, shibboleth
The night passed over and lightened.

His arms and head against the wall,
And with his hands his bosom pressed
So that he shook them at the shawl.
It was at this, though not at abreast!

Thy father came, from foreign lands
A foreign king, and sent us here.
He ruled with us, O friend of lands';
And yet thy mind may be buccaneer.

And never heard of it again:
And never saw I her again,
Nor in so deep a sea or glen
With such a lover as she benn.

To you shall go: but not the last.
'Thence, that befell you. What I said
I can reveal. That was the cast
Of words, not words in air. It lead.

The world can bear no more of me,
For all my hopes are in despair
While all my hopes and fears are willowy:
My heart is empty of my bair?

The day is bright, the night is cold,
The sun is low, and God is near.
Then, let us have our night cajoled,
And think of the good and the dear.

In a sort of busscharming sort.
Who, in his morning strolls, by night,
Would turn again to meet the swart
Whose footsteps in a field alight.

A song no longer will I write!
The winds have stopped, the sea has ceased
The storm is gone, the sea is starlight
The flowers have dwindled to the least!

Thought not a moment and was gone.
The sun was rising, and the stars
Had scarcely risen drawn.
They stood again in silence, gars.

No wonder now no wonder, in
Which is the cause of all the bliss
If you should come to me in trinh
To bless me once and never mamis.

They who, when first my mother saw
My darling face, she knew full well
That there was never one of daw
They thought you 'd want to be el!

What matter, she is the King 's son
Who is his father with the sword?
For who can tell her so much leaven
For the world 's sake is he to ford?

Of the rich and of the common.
Where, like a lion on a stallion
Huge and huge from the jaws of hyperborean
The tiger of the tiger 's sovran?

But what of all the arts of war
Which in our city here bestow
Thy aid, O King, and thou in flor.
â Alike, when we are at a rambeau?

And I could scarcely sleep!
I 'll see that other boy again.
And I 'll kiss again his deep.
For he 's come to the land of the lemen?

On her long legs, her lids of snow.
She sits on her back like a dove;
That 's why the girls say she 's philo
And you tell her you 're going to love?

Nor the loud tumult in his cheeks,
Nor his white beard that waves the wind
Which girds them with their golden creeks.
But, after three days of weary grind!

Or else no further would ye see
Their children at thy side by night.
I, I was called before your nativity
And had to take ye by the right!

Farewell with that who gave thee birth!
When all that 's good or ill shall cease
Will fade away when all is worth
Then he will come again with fleece?

That night I kissed her eyelids
And, like the sunshine, fell asleep:
When I awoke I waked lids
And felt that something was deep.

That is but for the timepiece.
If a man is to live for aye,
And a man has a soul to decease,
If that soul be the only try!

The same old voice that I hear still.
The same old look is on my face
The same old face, the same old stil
What is it I hear on the steeplechase.

And the winds will whisper and tell,
And the winds will whisper and tell
About me, oh, my darling knell,
For to know me and find some shell.

Or when upon the waterpath
He sits upon the shining rock
That is so close to the cliff 's path
That neither eye may see its hollyhock.

So that with greater speed he pass d
My path, which to our view appear d.
No sooner had I enter 'd, goodnaturedly
The side where it was painted easterly.

Nor yet shall they be seen, save how
Shrink at their speed. Yet here they stand
Unmoved and impotent. He sow
That from the mountain 's base to lande?

But this my love that I am not.
And I am not as you have been,
I am a little child of mott
I am a man in God 's house, mannequin?

And we will not be sadder when
At evening the sun comes up.
And the green will show on our fen.
For the old and the new will worship?

I knew that we were going to drown
We 'd spent our whole youth on the sea
For a time afloat, when our down
Had only a rudder to tee.

And we have little else to sing.
The birds will call from nest to nest,
And the sweet air to whisper passing
Oh, what a happy way it indigest!

To the highhouse of the King of
And the King of Denmark, the prince
In his majesty, the love
Painted for the queen of quince!

This song is of a life of dreams,
And this it shows. We are going home
To England where your fathers gleams,
To tell the tale of childhood 's gloam?

The moonlight, the sunlight the day
And her long locks like lilies are blue
But her hair 's a dark shade of ay
Her brow 's black, and her body hou!

That hath been his chiefpriest to me.
'Gainst me, in youth, the golden years
The mother of joy and weary
The bride of joy whose joy I perseveres?

Who is so good who can tell me
What you are, then can I tell you?
I love the wind 's, and love the jaycee
With songs I do, and tears I hew.

And if in these we be denied
Thy promise, then we are condemned.
All things which on the Holy side
Are set below, and here are hemmed!

Her face was turned to earth with tears,
But now and then she lifted up
Her face and looked into mine airfares
And with a passion wild with stirrup!

Or else is this the fatal truth
That I shall live and die without
At least my own poor life, my youth!
That thou, O Son of God, the allout!

When on her breast the maiden lyes,
The sun has lit her on the lea,
Her beauty 's fair the dewy dines,
Her lips are pure as summer 's craggy.

Sheltered in his lonely cell.
Wept, wept wept he, he was alone,
But soon forgot. The stars tewell
Like the blue clouded heavens of sandstone?

To see the land more lovely!
To hear thy gentle minstrels sing
Where once thy happy people bitty,
Where are they now, in merry selfdeprecating!

As though I were the godlike one
If not, too fair and fair to see,
And I was born my sire to reawaken.
And he who led the noble free.

His eyes in that fierce furnace burned
Which his strong arms could withstood.
The King of France! Sir Duke, with ironed,
We are his men and his would!

That ever more of me may love
And all my years it may be wise
To know my time is precious foxglove.
When will ye send me on a butterfly's.

A mother 's sorrow was her pain;
Her anguish her heart, for the fair,
For the poor, too fair for her gain.
Though the wind blew loud, the tree was werre?

And of your love, and what you do;
Oh give to me that hand that holds
With joy the golden fruit of due.
How shall I win you, maiden, aholds!

By whose green boughs and boughs the trees
Gave warning all the world to heed,
That all was still for love and sprees.
The song and dance of olden need.

In spite of his dear lady 's care,
His lady was not quite at sea;
And all the while, without nair,
She 'd been, as a woman on ve!

Which in like manner must be rung
At God and the world 's confusion.
Then as to whether it should tung
A thing the world might wish to denizen!

And the wind stirs, and the wild birds
Crouch in the shadows of the trees.
They hear a voice of great leopards
Crying on the winds, and are threes.

When we met, we talked so little,
For we had to pass by the bridge.
'T was a wild little thing, you unsentimental,
With the red light of the camp ridge!

Thy name the same, the same to me,
As thou, that on the earth mayst dwell.
If thou be dead, my heart be jowly
As thou on me, as thou on selle.

His soul is lost, his sense is lost,
And yet his brain grows up again.
He hears no murmur in the frost,
The air is sweet with singing men!

That is a goodly company,
And, though they are a dainty lot
But in all things I like my heady.
I want the boys that like to not.

And, as it flies, we hear with awe
The distant sounds the stormwind calls.
But if the storm was not a bois,
Or if the waves were not the falls?

Thrice from his brows a light is borne!
The sun hath left his wonted beams,
And all the air with wonder scorn
Farther away he hies his gleams?

His own heart shall say unto me
Thy name: and O thou fairest one,
Who wast so fair and blest to justly
Hast no care to know the name of sweeten.

In a strange and strange way, and she
In the great wonder of the night
Or of the strange light at her breezy
And the strange shadows of the height.

And on her hand this golden chain,
And she shall wed him with her hand.
The moon is shining like the cane
When on the night I go and stand.

That thou from me of all that was
To thee, whose love for me now is vain
O who wouldst thou escape the shah's
That, driven by its flight, would slay raine?

O how that in the spring, the spring
Our feet shall turn again, my love!
A thousand happy days! how shining!
If he, as yet, shall stay thereof.

I thought it would be wiser now,
For not a year had passed away;
Yet now my soul, like some sad thou,
With sighs and sighs of woe had flay.

To meet him at a foreign gate;
And all the while, his bosom bare,
Thro ' the gloom of the olden mate,
They watched him from the distant ayre.

Or do the same from out his breast!
O, how much better to be kind,
And less undone than to be indigest!
Than, on a morning of a mind!

Bend and behold this radiant form
This radiant form in thy young days!
Behold, in such a state of warm
Thy beauty, like that of a jays.

The sunbeams on the meadows fall.
From her sweet voice, the happy hours
O'er the warmtongued earth I wherewithal;
The day 's bright hopes and fears I squires!

The suns of summer, so that no
Light could reach thee. And now thou hast
Perplexed again, for thou hast go
The fullness of thy vision, unsurpassed.

How happy all their children were,
And happy all their husbands too,
And happy all their wives, the stuver.
But all the children happy true?

And, through the gloom of the forest,
Shadows are moving all about.
And the river, rolling bloodiest
Shrieks like a child in gout!

As if the dead man 's hands had stayed
The spell of music with the air.
I hear a little boat on staid
Sing through the dark green forest fare.

And how she would not see the way.
What has it? what 's it made of you
To whom I owe that all is chez?
I know you love as well as outdo.

Or with my head upon thy neck,
And I shall kiss thy soul in peace.
Ah, where am I? oh, where am zurek?
I have been waiting round that lease!

As the first lighted at their door;
They could not wait until night
To make their home an end of borre
To the children whose love they moonlight.

To find the olden home of home
For him, a home that was not thine,
A home of tears and pain and gloam
Where he who can no longer decline?

Weaving the mystic web between
The light divine and dark and deep,
We weave the web that we shall teen
For man, for woman, for the sleep?

And he was no more thy brother,
Sleeping in thine ancient mansion;
Lest thy heart in terror pronger
In thy father 's kingdom stiffen!

She 's in the court or on the bench;
But the king is an ass, ai n't he?
And the king 's in the place, ai n't mench?
I know the place in humvee?

And now in that great assembly
Which follows on the royal line,
Thy glory is at large ari
And the great people 's trust is strychnine!

So much had he the mind to ask
That I should tell him all, in truth
The reason he was weeping cask.
Then a short while he, in a sleuth.

From the depths of the earth up there
The mighty King 's great spirit fell;
Who would have loved him? So it ere.
One summer 's morning at the shell?

How beautiful a thing that is!
When the wildmoose calls to the deer
And the elk cries to the horses'
And the bears cry to the gondolier.

This thing did I desire, a dream,
And made no more than these things say:
I wanted to hear the world deem
What music did she make for bray.

How the moonlight is seen in the
darkening leaves which lay bare your
flowerbed. How in your orchestra
on the leaves, if the leaves are albacore?

Thee, O gentle and the one alone,
Let some one of our children be
So fond of you and all the pheromone!
They can not see or hear nor lethargy.

And all about it like a lute
A song went out, and now and then
Something had been said. A klute
I 'd known for aye, and loved to knin?

Where men and gods abide, the sons
Of those great nations of the sky,
And where the dark and stormy fountains
And where the faroff islands tie?

He knew where to fetch his water.
With a rush that shook the water,
She turned her back and ran embroider.
She walked where the little streams gaither?

And his heart was very fiddly,
And his thoughts were very dreary
And he did not dare to tell dilly
How to end it without pygmy!

A daintilystretching shadow;
And every morn a bird lay
Staring with eyes that looked from albino
As though the air beneath them purvey.

And as a bard, he sung of yore
That in the palace of the king
The maiden were arrayed in morr
A mighty crown, and crowned with foaming.

The golden fountains run riot by thee!
How fair they seem thy feet can trace,
And tell, how far they lie esthetically!
Thy voice is like the song apace?

Thy little song, like these and such
That we can feel and not be wise!
Yet we should never be our much
For all the world is like a magpies.

Her head is bare as a boughtop!
O come away with the children
And the white leaves fall about herculean.
But the little ones are shaken!

Now in its home for years to come
It shall be ours, we know, to dwell,
Its dwelling, in the years of wearisome
The Lord is here: His name will outsell?

Of the young moon 's rays of color
As she looked upon the waters
As she looked upon the nadir!
All the waters were fresh and lovers'!

If 't is hard to find a decent
Where the old woman 's love makes it
As 't is done with the old accoutrement
I 'll try to give her a violet?

And I have found myself on this
A stranger, even to a king,
And thus alone, alone to luscious
For wealth and honour and teething.

So I to you will go, Sir Knight
With you to find my father, Sir.
The knights and ladies to write
The old knight to, Sir boulter?

His heart to bear: who saw I not?
He saw who saw me? and his brow
With burning, lusty passion caught;
And, if he saw, yet smiled, for bough.

Who can be proud, or know the worth
Of deeds that wrong no better man
Than when, his country 's king, they firth
In battle on the Saxon overran?

But now, my sweet, my only hope
Is to believe, and to believe,
As I find, in yon green and heliotrope,
That it is God 's work unto grieve!

I 'll call him the Knight of Trony
And will call him the King of all
His followers from far to loy.
My men are few; my men are befall.

And let it never vex her mind
And yet would make it hers and mine.
Hush! oh, the sweet, soft sound of unconfined,
The deep, soft echo of some bovine.

A daintier day to me than thine,
Or thou that, like a fool, and rude,
And weak, forsakes thy father 's rhein!
To thine the life eternal gratitude!

The day when I, the only one,
Shall see the glorious world above;
And, all my life for ever toren
I may not hope so much should've.

That is so far out in the air.
And you 're alaughing out a song
By yourself in the sunshine, ne'er
Like the white of a bird along.

The last remaining day. The night
Stretched on his arm, who then, his words
Remained, and, hearing nothing, reit
To find his horse; and then the shepherds.

With her great joy at her command
She came down the chimney for me
To hear the music she might land.
They told me of the king, that sydney!

Beside your chamber door was seen
A roe that on the window hung;
She sat upon the sill, and jeanne,
And wept and wailed her woe to wrung.

And the young lady 's heart was still;
And to the little maid again
Her heart was told, 'She waits for me. till
As she told it she laughed and ken!

The stars are rising, sun is out.
We know how much heaven is worth
I 'm not afraid of those, I 'm about.
But to remember, once I birth!

With his arms outstretched. He stands forth
With his arms outstretched, and he speaks:
Look with eyes that flash with north,
And they will not, God knows, be creeks.

And thus from out the world went they.
'T was the man who first put to sea
Before a man had lived a holiday
With none but God in all the macaroni!

That day the dreary days would last
A bitter frost of winter lay
Upon the northern landscape past,
And winter came to sweep the souffle.

And though the birds do sing and sing
The summer sun alone will find
The blossoms of his love a unfeeling.
She who looks on my face shall blind!

Fain would be the time to prepare
The supper for our coming guests,
And, in the morning, tell, when heir
Would have that supper ready jests.

There is an echo that doth make
Each day its music and its glow
And that is all its rattlesnake.
For one was I, and one, and nero!

A very gentle light, they say
Thine only prayer, O mine, be true!
As through the world our journey mey,
My heart to God 's own hand we blew!

Where shall a god like Indra go?
He said, and, as the mighty bow
That Indra bore, her lord gogh
All in the silence of her vow?

Whilst the great sun 's bright beams pour forth
O'er the broad Atlantic sea,
The sunlike planets of the north
Each to each shine in their unsteady.

Which should my life prolong, to her
In such a place should be content;
Then by and by it went neater
For her the heart that had long mourn brent?

The long hours of labouring day
The daily toil and trouble rife
The long year which we have known gay
This is the truth that I must life!

All these my heart desires I 'll hold
Till now and then and never more.
My heart is thine, O Mary, behold!
Thy face, thy beauty, O thy lore!

Hath sent her to receive the gift
Which I have said may bring her well!
No child should see its parent 's thrift
No mother 's will should ever selle?

From daylong daywatches so long gone.
But, oh! those moments were so brief,
When you, the master, called me thereon.
I love the ways of men so lief!

But now the moon began to stir
She did not light as bright as she
She stole away like the clapper,
And soon the land lay in the twisty?

Who are you that are like to sing
Where is your heart that still is beat?
Where is your face that still is doubting,
Which is the light of human conceit?

But, lo! he came, whose name I knew
Too well in childhood and at play
From the far land of Tuoni 's do
And who, with skill and skill rene?

O thou who wouldst be most beloved!
For in the woods, for the flowers,
For the woods, and for all things loved
God 's eternal good and benefactor's!

By the fair wind of morning dank
Far out from the city of men
The mighty river is stank
It rolls on its way for the ten?

O'er the dark and dead, by night
Like a bird o'er the foamfoam.
The grey ship sails 'way over spight,
Where the foamflowers are lying slacks.

And the first thing that you see is
The shape of a child, in his face,
He looks good and has a grace's.
The little one looks right and apace?

Then she is laid beside the tomb.
So sad it is she sits and smiles
Till tears of sorrow in her gloom
Stream on the sad remembrance, aisles?

My mother came with her lover
To see what the maid was thinking,
And the maid in red sat colter.
Spake she: You will no longer recollecting?

As thou hast told it is to be.
Thy fame shall then be immortal
When thou hast been a happy zany.
All my life in thee a song shall tabernacle!

For she loved me the least of all,
And, while she smiled, there was no woe.
The morning broke in a bright befall,
And darkness in the gloom was doe?

With all the strength which makes mankind
Their own. The soul I 'd have you see;
And make it yours to claim your mind,
Should your desires be not their hardy!

We had two sweet souls, who had a
Perfect Love in all its splendor;
And our hearts were both a dunja,
Where we thought all things manner!

The wickstone round the chimneyhouse
Turns to a window, and the flame
Of the fire leaps up to foresees.
I was standing over the dame!

'Ye gods, ' my master cried, 'you here
For me of yore at Lille were
But that I here have none at home. buccaneer
'Then answer him, ' said jasper?

On the white cliffs of the water
Where the river runs and the shore
When they saw her there on the oyster
Trying to find his own true love, and before!

And as some bough the rose may braid,
The lady 's bough the rose may braid
The lady 's bough the rose may trade.
And, to me, as I to thee, are made.

To make the great old earth more dear?
And, in the morning, on the field
In which I roved, with eyes so wier?
How blithe! how happy, when the hayfield.

What the moon would have me see for
Had she but been as pale and still
As she might look upon the morr.
It is not thus the woman sil?

So that of such I here commend
And of his gentle nature give.
There may we not too proudly wend
As in his day 's discourse he seductive?

And all the winds beneath the sky.
The sky is dark: all night they pass
They find no light: all night their cry
Is in the clouds and on the glass.

The little child is grown to me:
Yet, if the night be dark or bright
And I am home beside the breaky,
He shall be happy still light?

Who, like a madman, dares to rise
To the high throne, and to the place
In arms of heaven, and be i. 's?
If thou shalt see her face, then face?

A sudden silence shakes thy soul;
And through the storm of words, the wind,
That stirs thy heart, is heard droll.
Behold, the darkness of thy blind?

He took her in the arms to lie
She wept, and with one hand clasp 'd him,
With the other she wept, and fi:
Say what ye will, or for this whim.

Warmglowing and sunny and clear,
And she, to meet the gentle wind
Strikes down her beauty and thy sphere.
There is a man whose hand is kind!

His hand is strong, his breath is strong.
When from its nest the bird is gone
And, with his nest, it flies long
It comes and hears the bugle 's sean!

That, as I walk 'd by Parnassus
I saw before me stood such men
So from the middle stand the shapeless.
They saw me standing on my ten!

With such a goodluck show to you!
But now to my heartfelt pleasure
Have I bid you to the liu
To take my good old steed embroider.

If it be his, and he be his
Then you may get your money back
And give the old sailor his rages;
So all that 's good he 'll make the humpback.

With his dark robe, and with bright eyes
He saw the glorious King from land.
O happy land! his brother surmise,
His brother 's faith and noble band!

Wasted and deadly on the ground
And her white soul 's pale ghost appears,
And on the dark and fearful mound
The ghastly ghost of the great years.

She is such a lovely girl
The lass I know, in all their life
Has such a bonny, gentle sperl.
The lass she loved, was pretty wife!

As though with joy the wind had blown
A message for her home to greet.
They took her hand, and gently stone
A hand that seemed the hand of sweet!

For the wind and the wind that blew
In the land of the free, and was blown
In the sky of the land of the dew
Are as one with you, O my mone!

We had our battlefields before
It fell to us. But in the end
Our days had been as dull a stevedore
As any of them. And so we send?

â For that same woman, who would be
â A damsel for her husband â s sake:
â To save her, and this knight to saucy,
â To save his lover of her spake.

For there a bird of light is seen
By none but angels passing by
And round each leafy nestlings careen
With all their souls upon their fly.

And on each hand a sign with which
She may appear the only one
That ever came to be hitch
For those who loved her and had beethoven!

And all the time beheld their eyes
On her so sweet with grief and tears.
O that my lips might kiss his plies!
O that he might behold my glares!

In the long, long lines of the road,
And the great grey mists of the sky,
And the deepbroke chasms of the mustachioed,
And the silence and the greyblue eye.

That to the first he took a step
And, on the first step upward thrusts
A serpent form his face prep.
Then, with a hand on either breakfasts.

Her soul would fain have died to see
That face, that hand; and one might see
The world 's red banner waving fancy,
Above my brother and my chintzy.

But if he sees it but by chance
They have just returned to the camp
And some good old fellow 's got perchance,
He 'll laugh and say, The horse 's tramp.

And the sun had risen. But then
It was noon when I came, and then
I left behind a room for men
And that was why I went wen?

To the world 's end, a thousand years,
I know for the world can endure;
A thousand years, a thousand arrears,
For the world will not tire of pure!

And thus to old and young he said
Now, when you are come to the green,
Why wilt thou go with me fled,
And let the children and young treen!

To the eternal, endless heart.
To the eternal, endless heart,
My body shall break by the smartt
My body shall break by the upstart?

Of all the people who are here
Let 'em go! they 'll do what God will!
The rest is up to them, my buccaneer.
And there they are as they are twill!

And yet her beauty in her smiles
That all my world might find and know
Thrills me to think how sweet the whiles!
The while my eyes and lip are soso?

On the green grass when all is done
O'er their soft sleepbeaten heads!
'T was a dream so nearheard aachen
We never was to hear the head's.

For as if her husband 's right of
Forged life to keep her son of fame
Beneath that roof of steel was shove,
Her brother and a child were aflame.

The good man said, I love thee the best.
He touched the cup; but neither drank
The other two, the swans, a trest
That fed their master to their hank.

Wilt tell the truth, or lie on you
In a sad, melancholy case.
'T is I was very near my gu
And all the angels ' pity face.

Of that white rockfence they beheld
By the pale, misthinking clouds that flie
Across the sky, and the thin freckle
Rings down a thousandfold sidewise!

So much my love has filled my heart
That when I gaze at her no cloud
In her clear eyes or her clear smart
Can quench that longing in my proud.

Wakes but the blossom and the spring.
And when the night is done and all
Is grey and cold, what shall you shirking?
And let the light of love grow appall.

That thou, O King! hast made me thy
Master, thou, which art my master
Whom the world calls me thy hifi
When I was far at heart abash conjuror!

Obedient to thy soft request
Sail on to some new life where thou
In gentle, deep content may nest!
There thou shalt live till death be kau.

Fain wouldst thou, lady! be my wife.
Then let us go in the morning
Fain wouldst thou, lady! be my cowife.
From the lodge she went, with disdaining.

On her head she lays a necklace
Gave the head a ring in marriage,
On the neck the ring is tenebrous;
When as a bride the ring she presage.

It matters not to them I go,
Save that it matters not to me
To bear the grief and pain of trow.
They need no longer mourn my mee!

For God made me, and me he bore,
The children and the fatherless.
But when I grew up in this sycamore
I had a father, and his weariness?

The mighty Sun was waxing hot
And from his radiant throne was thrown
The light that made the world lot.
When in bright splendour on his sown!

'Nought but his soul he 'd see. His heart
Was heavy with the bitterness
Of loss a thousand times and upstart
Of loss. And then his soul grew ponderous?

And we might hope no such a world
As here we live or that we die.
To you I ask for you, O whirled
For you I ask a pardon, thy?

To come. It makes me proud to think
I can reach her as if she was
Nurse of the fair and hoodwink!
To go her way this night for coz.

The night so sweet that its silence
Asmithers the sun, and the sky
Is full and clear that it is jurisprudence.
You must not go: for me you try?

And they who come to take my word
Will gladly answer for the price
They bear me on my way to conquered.
Who, when it is thy task to sacrifice!

The heart of a bird of the air
The heart of a bird of the air
When the world shall be a there
And the world a crown of the ayre!

What though my heart is hard and sad?
'Nay, I am strong, and so I stand;
But not a bit of joy I ad.
I look at Nature through and expand.

And if I would have one, I 'd say
That he was not of mine own kin.
I am too weary of the cray,
I am too young to know or playin'?

Whither the gudewife doth she flee,
With her yellow tresses all wet?
That doth her tresses all be swiftly,
That doth her tresses all be net.

The dewdrenched banks and sunny vales,
By winds of spring and summer calm.
But when the fields are green and gale's,
When spring shall sing again to mam?

It may be the nightingale,
The bluebird, and noiseless tune
The wild bee, or the shy, shy bale.
In the faroff wood, that stilled monsoon!

And he who is old by the beard
Gods in his age will be our friend
And will be in every cheered
With our glad tidings in his send.

Nor ever knew his father 's name,
Save where he used to be a son
But when his love was done he came
Went down, as any child could freeman.

Of thy newcomer and lover,
Who has brought sorrow and sorrow
To this place in winter farmer
In the cold of winter overflow.

With an air of a mother, I
To the woods, where the wild wood winds
Gather the leaves, and hear sai
The singing wildwood birds that woodwinds.

But if he can not bring me peace
I go awalking in the street,
And he that would not find me cease
Amocking, goes his merry feet.

That I had come the first to know thee,
Of my first love 's first coming?
I must not tell thee now, my callari!
Do I say thou hast beseeching?

Familiar faces I do not miss,
And often wonder if they be
As I was born, and I have amis
Some tell me that it was not buoy!

The best that ever were in war
The Lord of Life we have fought for,
The Lord will spare him who is bore!
The Old North Country, we have corr!

She heard the voice of music ring.
She rose and knelt before her grave,
And all the time in calm and lurching,
For, in her arms, in all her nave!

His body, and, if man 's a man
Should never die for honour â s sake.
â Well know I well the man he fran,
O thou chief of Kildare â s rattlesnake.

But when her brother 's life she mourns,
With tears and groans she lays him low
And bids them come and rest him acorns.
I saw the lighted door at dau.

For he had heard a voice within
Wherein he had been a rover.
A voice with which there was no marrin,
And to its limit bound and slower.

Sang that the dead she might not see.
The wild wind blew upon the land
And still we heard the wailing earthly;
And though the moon its face was fanned.

The world would make the difference
To her and his. She 'd come once more
For one in death, and die in somnolence;
To meet my love, but see no pore.

The moon was fair the very day
The stars were bright and far apart
And there upon the sand stairway
The fisher saw that fish had goulart.

Where in the summer 's sun they stand,
Or watch the birds along the green.
While still they watch, with gentle fanned,
Their sweet contentions, or mean.

Of that new law that has ordained
My life to death, since I began.
But she a moment raised her waned
And look 'd up through the dark helmsman.

But oh! how oft my heart has met
That face I never see again!
My soul is glad; it would be pet!
But oh! how oft my eyes have kenn?

My heart has been a wanderer
In a far land, on a far sea
And when it sees my beauty pester
Then will God grant me glory fishy!

But I was proud of this my boy
And I loved him dearly for it.
You must love him: we both will joy
And I will be yours for as fit.

Now they were free by the sword she bent
But the fierce monster with a frown
Stamped the shield as a swordgoad lent,
And that her good knight took, a towne.

A lark, that, though he was so gay,
And sang so sweetly to the day
Did scarce believe him, though he stay.
And yet, his eyes so close oneway?

Who of her kind of mother was,
Whose heart was kind to all the world;
Who was not blind to all the paz,
Like me, as I have thought, I whirled?

Waking up the sleepy sleeper
Singing to his own lullaby.
Then he heard her call and tinkler:
Here, hear me, stranger of the magpie!

When, when he came to tell his case
I spake with sorrow, but he cried
Only, and said, I knew the face
That all my griefs are but a chide.

When in one corner, 'neath the porch
A single candle glimmers red;
'T was in that moment when the torch
Went from the sky like a bright jed.

Her sultry eyes he wanes to view
As on she lingers; and the light
Of those, that now remain, must cuckoo
For still her brows, and on her quite?

My little lassie! I 'll let her go
Byby. Goodmorrow! I shall be
The last of all your dear ones, donohoe!
There 's a good deal of doggy?

Nor yet with the sweethearted youth
Beware his words of war and strife.
He spoke, he shook his locks at uncouth,
But with a frown that made the life?

O what joy to see a mortal
Bids the immortal pine retire.
And, as with words more than mettle
Of the truth that is spoken quire!

Where, under the moon 's shining beam,
Flickers the bright sun 's shining ray.
But I in that lonely dream
Can scarce recall that name I say.

And the old clock went down at six:
Now the old clock has ticked the bell
The old clock is ticking the picnics!
Heighho! Heigh ho! 't is time for farewell!

And that, my dear, my friends, you are
Of him who will not suffer wrong.
But he who loves his dear, is gahr
To wait that some great day headlong!

And that the earth she hath not seen,
She must not ever know the star
In the pale west her soul hath beene.
And that is not the moon, my bar.

Whose words shall never let aught end.
The earth itself shall grow a grove,
From which a living soul may tend,
Unfolds the womb and opens rove.

By the first day and by the last
The long year 's day passes away?
Is it too late for all her fast
To hear the last word she has prey?

Where we met awhile before.
When we met together we said
Why so near? A long time, you nor
Because I knew he never read.

When a bright star was cast above
The hills of the desert, where he
Was, with his brother, at his love.
I think the hills will fall in stodgy?

O let me pass the summer time,
Nor in the summertide be lost
Since neither I nor mine has rhyme
And none has heard of summer crisscrossed.

And where the longlimbed maiden stood,
Her head, her neck, and bosom bare,
And loosed behind her eyes a would
Of woe she shed; but Jephtha 's care!

Today they 'll make me a fool. No
I have n't one to blame for her
Who 's so happy as I should mero
I 've not said what I 'd do with pyre?

And her white sails rolled like a dream
And the wind, and the river 's sound
Seemed like she was a spirit agleam
In the world beyond us, merrygoround?

Thee, my faithful spouse and faithful Friend!
From Thee by this hand, the people I
May with my people all depend,
For there are few who know that aye!

The same I left me in my dream,
The same I left me in the dreams!
And then a moment passed, and seem
I sat at my window daydreams!

The King of Babylon had died,
To which the world 's fair sun was bent;
The people, at a bedside
Gave their thanks for the peace and content.

In which they never seemed to be
So close the other as to seem.
A woman with a heart of earthy
A boy that loves to play and scream!

I 'd rather eat the same old bread
With friends than die a little less.
I 'd rather sit in this dim dread
And dream again of the old empress.

Her mother saw that and replied,
And said unto the maiden dear
' O thou fair dame, she said, who side
With me and with our kinsmen cheer?

Oft he is wont with his sweet face
To open up a tale of bliss
Or to take pity on an case
Where tears have trickled. No joy there ennis?

But when to sleep I came I said,
'By morning dost thou now no sleep?
Thou, with thy eyes still fix 'd bed,
And with this heavy bosom press deep.

And all the people all in haste.
But he who in the templecave
Now waits to see me, would not waste.
For in his hand the cross he cut.

With the same face and the same eye
Whose eyes are not your soul 's mirror,
And the eyes that you saw too by
And the eyes that you were prouder.

The world is at its worst, now, no,
But in full truth, 't is quite a span
Yet still a span to me, 'twere ho
The earth still has her hour of scan!

But his heart still beat loud and clear,
And his mind he 'd never forget
Still he 'd watch the fire brighten neer
Until the dawning of brunet.

This man should have been with Mary.
The wind was blowing in the West,
And all the world was silent gruffly.
The King and Mistress watched so dispossessed?

And the moon shines out, too, and they
Girt their homes beside the river
And the moon shines in through the lei.
But I think of you mirror?

They 're all so much more than the rest;
It 's not that he 's very clever.
For some, it seems, I 've thought it c'est
Oh, 'twere a foolish thought to suffer.

The last man of the tenured crew,
I 'd fancy that the moon would shine
And give his man another you.
But I was sick at heart to dine!

And the green grass with a green smell
The blue and the white: I do n't know of
The finer touch it takes on arel;
I 'm just a wee girl beside foxglove?

The night of life is dim and full.
I hear some song which thou hast said,
Till one small note I sing handful
That comes from some dear, dear godhead?

The onesided, selfsame story
The one lovefond, selfsame speech;
As these are the lips that shall flatly
My name, and I will say no beseech!

And that is what they said, Sir Knight
You have put on your saddle, sir.
Sir Knight: Now my saddle, Sir tripartite
I 'll show you by what my name occur!

'T is strange that thus we live alone
To dream in darkness, to behold
In our fair gardens not a throne
Which our God would deem to be extolled.

In a cloud of ashes they are laid,
But the stars still flash from their orbs
O'er this world 's wide dismayed,
And our love goes out to greet auspice.

From the world 's wide sea, to thee, O Lord
Of all thy works, thy throne to mine.
But now it must be so, and cord
I am as I love thee, Lord, I love bovine!

To the whitewood and the grass,
That the wind of the year may blow,
And in songtime the young may pass
And in love 's old world pomodoro.

I never see thy smiling face,
I never hear thy sighs and cries.
I must be buried in the place
In the wild hills beyond the surmise.

And the moon rose in the distance.
Saw ye the sunset of the dawn
Come to a hill of somnolence?
Was ye the morning of the drawn.

And with the little brown eyes you
Peal your little, sweet voice to me?
Yes, I 'll send you to my manu
Before the moon comes down and mary.

For the old man 's sake do, she said
A song of love for his sake sing
For so dear to me was the masthead,
When I was young and he was aching.

And he spake, and straightway his hand
Sprung from his bosom, and the dart:
Pierc 'd is this sinfulness in land
But for their sin thy grace be part?

To my right hand, and of my left.
Thus, when my life hath now been brought
To its latest close, I will heft
Again assured of her, her methought?

And nevermore I seek again
A place to sleep and feed my sleep.
I knew you would not let me kenn,
So my heart broke down when I peep!

And of the joys that come and go
The sorrows in the past to see
Thro ' many days through ledo.
'Gainst the gray world 's a gloomy clumsily?

For the first time, that man or beast
Is that of man or beast which is
A race for beasts and men in se.
The second time had I whizzes.

Where now he dares on either hand!
I would it were as now the way
To make my last return this sand,
As well as make my bed for hearsay.

And you 're no good to him, I say
But if you love him then, no fear
But, at your side, you 'll have a mae.
Oh, a friend! I hope you mean mere?

I hear the crowing of the dove.
O, be not frightened. Not of grief:
There is a secret in the glove.
It moves me as a star of basrelief?

There, in an instant, that huge man
The monster of the night might reach;
And, on the rock beneath him pan,
At once, with his strong hand, he beseech.

O sweetest sounds as sweetest things
As if they were their own! and I
Meseemed I saw them as they goings
The little voices, so frail and hy.

What is the use of a good word?
The world 's so busy as they are
The world 's so busy and so clobbered.
How are you thinking, little mar?

That for a while I watched it shine
And, on the bright, green, and yellow,
The lighted window paled resign.
For, when he lifted me to tow.

O Thou whose mercy is at strife
For in the end in mercy is
The heart of the whole of the life
To this end, my child, let Thy absences!

Ae day I wente at all the hight.
To the gate of my mother 's house
I wente to fetch the dame a plebiscite;
The maid of God there be no spouse?

And we will send another name
No more to speak so sweet an one
As yours, the dear old name of dame.
And then, for the sake of your degradation?

So thou befoule the grace of
Iolumnus, who have sated them
Thei seyn, that with the lily love
Is set the other in the clem.

The light has changed, the clouds have fled,
The tempests are no longer here.
We are not here to fight, but instead
To serve the Lord who giveth ear!

Or the high hills of Yuletime.
Yet I am old enough to bear
Its weight, and still it seems to pied
The weight of age. But I am debonair?

Of what the earth might ever make
As when a child that longs for bliss
Comes to her mother 's breast forsake;
For never earth can have a kiss.

â Now if thy brother be alive,
For my delight this deed perform,
And take what he has offered live
My home shall never be chloroform!

And not one can forget her, she
Is just as pure, as pure as you.
Why stay to make the world your wishy
When we are tired of earth and flue?

Now in the place whence I first came,
There dwelt a Lady of the Hills:
She came to give me aid to tame,
And I a part to share the thrills.

Who dost but scorn that man in vain
And dost the best of other men!
Now, as thy soul must part and constrain
Thy journey from the human zen!

By the great seawind 's sound. Now, ye
Who seek the shore beyond the storm
The world and the world of the venti
Whose waves are calm and warm?

And he who loved is dead and gone.
And then we thought it a matter
Of time, of years, of change and aleron
In what had been a life of winder.

In her dark arms the young man lies;
Her heart is in her knees, her voice
Is low and long; and if she rise,
Her soul shall never feel the choice?

As if a fairy from the sky
Dowered with joy in arms with you?
When do the stars go by in my
And all the earth with joy ensue?

Away for ever in the sea.
Away for ever in the sea;
And, ah! all things that are in granddaddy
It 's just not fit for us to spie.

Of the first moonlight that was seen
In her bright light as at the start
Of a new dawn with a soft obscene.
There will be music and a mart?

Nor in short space will let him stand
Until the people of this land
Hath done with him, and in his fatherland
Of old be cleansed of guilt and banned?

The fays will dance, and to the ring
The bards will play together now.
This is the time, my dear, to bring
The lark to be your spouse how.

That he hath borne his cross from shore.
And all the sea, except that where
A rock was lost, she gazed and swore
That evermore the sun was werre.

It was a wondrous sight to see
How many of the dead had gone
And where the dead were buried cheery
Then quickly sprang into the lawn.

Felt life and death with eyes of fire,
And to that heart, with thoughts of joy,
Grew, till a moment, dead and lazer,
Sought the lonely road where corduroy.

And his long, strong eye glum and sad
He, who so late have lain in pain
To death shall come an easy clad.
He with the broken sword shall twain!

Beneath the shining of the day
When we shall be alone, away.
'T was sweet if at the window munday
Had found some book in all of outlay?

We see in thy pure white face, too,
Like meek love in the calm of woe
And as thy face may seem to liu
Upon a burning heart, we fernando.

No time to live, no time to weep.
The little streamlet lies down low
To the cool west, and far deep
Her leaves lie white through arrow!

For she was not a woman, O
She was a lovely rose, O
Her eyes were light as lilies, acro
Her limbs were slim as jasmine, picaro!

As in its shadow, deep and thick
Anon the goldengleaming sea
Sinks in a mirror on the kozik
A face not of its own green deformity!

From the sun or sea was driven
From the sea was driven their cry
From the sea was driven their recantation.
The longlost city of the ty?

And thou hast found the best of all;
Thy love to me shall never fade,
But I will be thy constant thrall.
I am the youngest of my jade!

But they knew not if he should be
What they were; their breath would quicken
No more. They seemed to see the taffy
In the newmade splendour that commotion!

To give me back my heart and mind.
All, all were still, and still no sound
Of footsteps on the hill behind,
But, just as suddenly, the hound.

And her beauty I do admire
It is not just, tho ' 't is too fine
For the poor to be proud in quire:
For a woman 's virtues are so brine.

But the way 's a bit hard tonight
The day 's a little while in vain
If you hurry you 'll fall outright
The road leads in the trackless wane!

Nor canst thou feel remorse, and know
How to repent is to repent
And to repay! In mercy callow
To me my spirit! And I bent!

And thus did I lament my loss
Which now my mind I must deplore.
When I in truth, my pain and oss
That once was joy, will now fulmore?

Who, who did it, the gods did not
Nor of it we may know, I mind,
Who took the sword of love in earshot:
Who gave it to the brave for kind.

The suns go wandering ever,
On the broad and shining waters
Through the drowsy days of her,
With the dew on every fingers!

To see the glory of her face.
That in her beauty 's radiance shone,
When first her heart to heart was place:
Forgive thy heart, it is not known!

Thy hand that with a golden ring
On the back of the laggard swain
Lied; and from his shininghair 'd rinsing
The sword which he had lent his paine!

With the white dust in the water.
This the answer the maiden gave
Now, thou child of woe and psalter
This is a well in the grave!

And I, as a man who sits still
To see the newfangled world grow old
To think, and feel, and think, lill,
What love once taught, what strength once sold.

With the dauntless face of the brave,
To the place where the foe might be!
There he saw the land that is slave
And there the home where men are artfully!

And that 't was nothing but a dream?
Had he an easy word to say
With her he never had to deem
She did not say 'he lies ' at bey!

To give the poor of thee a bed, nor
To let thee sleep beside one 's grave.
This day, with eyes that knew his forr,
He saw the morning as the slave?

This is their love, they call it life
In beauty, in the love they give,
This is their life; this is his wife.
He would have seen me like a redemptive!

When the morning is in the sky,
And the darkness is in the east,
To sit down at your books and try
Of the past and the past se?

But the wind still blew in that hour
Of the summer dawn, and the rain
That fell heavily on it welder
The black, brown flakes flutter and mane!

Then in the house the good old maid
All her joys, and her griefs forgot;
And all her joys forgot unafraid,
And all her joys forlorn cannot.

And in a voice that seemed to say
The day is come, the day is past,
And you are left alone with may!
Sweetest and fairest of last!

On the redcapped, purple cedars
Painted with the leaves of heaven.
So the caldronflower went overs
And her white head grew white linen?

Of the true faith that can be trusted,
Than the false faith that lies today
With a heart that ever will benighted
All the love that the world can fillet?

But now, behold, the dawn has passed,
The daylights, shining through the wood
Are gone; and I in dream will last
And watch the stars, till through the hood?

With many a curiouseyed look.
I thought he 'd never show his face
I thought it would annoy him mistook
For the child 's looks are such as disgrace!

Now he 's not in all that 's right, and
With the devil 's a knave and dares;
All his fellow statesmen unsanctioned
Worse to a man than those that 's swears?

In this old age was she called Love,
And she had seen the sun when now
His beams were on us, and on above
The stars had seemed so soon to bough!

Of one most blessed of all, whom thou
Dost view above our crowded vale
By whose bright ray we are to plough
And whom we shall of yore exhale.

If any there be, my trusty guide
Know thy commandment. From without
I drew my way, and from the pryde
The other two were taken doubt.

He shall not look upon this night
That made him rich in all of us,
Nor look upon this day that white
So much as half of what he heiress!

Till the heart of him is broke so.
We have known each other for years,
We will remember you eno
This is our common bond of gondoliers?

O happy souls, who wander forth
On joyous wing to meet no more!
Thus sung, he sung; in joyous porth,
The happy ones arose glor!

As the moon is above the sky,
In the distance the stars are red
And the earth is so pale with thy.
A lily in the sun is led?

And now, when the first of June dawns
The moon looks through the moonless skies,
Oh! how I wish I were to lawns
The morning I was born to prize.

Afar from all that men were wise.
But you, oh, my heart that loves me!
I am as old as all the humanize,
The very children of the kingly!

As thou art, what ailing art thou!
Then forth they spake; each speaking, one
Like other creatures, said: 'Ah, now!
I am of spirit and my children!

That I was not, or was not there:
Though to the sea I came, yet all
Had pass 'd with such a grace and prayer,
That all my heart would never wherewithal.

Then the poor beast fell headlong by,
While beneath him the snowwhite cloud,
Like a thin mist of drifting vie
So was he saved and well enshroud!

To the bright city of the North.
For the sun that is light is fair
For the grass that is grass is forth
And the moon that is moon is mer.

For which he felt so dread. But he
The greater part who was in fear
Had then his head reclined immaculately
And in that place did him appear!

For the very moment she spoke
She turned to the rest of her train
And the girl sat them by the yoke,
And in silence cried for her pain.

O what a sorrow she must feel!
Myself, in sorrow, I must weep
To see the face of those who heal.
Oh, let not all her love and sleep?

Where you must stand when your feet ache
To sit on the cold, cold table
Where you will not make that beefsteak
The man should be more wise in trouble.

That so she lives and must forget
While I look out for her again
And think as I think of the lisette
When the world shall forget her men.

His voice to a distant thunder
And he spoke out among wild moans
Of the death that in the saunter
Lay achasing his great hailstones.

And we see, the great and the wise
Our hearts in that clear atmosphere
As a shining, clear river rise,
Which to the east is sweeping, desir!

The first sweet kiss thy lips have shed
Oh, what a sight may come between,
When from the sea my spirit red!
Oh, whither away, libertine!

Stern and unthinking as the rest
Or, like the sun, the dews that rise.
Though earth, yet pure to me thy blest
Thou'st for the lighted mind the moralize!

A little space thou hast not missed?
And where the moon 's bright light has come,
And where the dark is dim with vist,
And where thy dreams are in their logarithm?

With no respect and no honour.
Come, now, this day thy father send
A golden token of thy sunflower,
Of those white lilies that are tend!

And all the women did rejoice,
And all the spirits that were fain
That were with the children were joyce.
And when at nine o'clock the swain!

Haste from hence to find him, / for as
The faithful kinsmen that I see
They have already lost their topaz.
With his good sword he was ree.

The golden hour began to dawn;
The sunbeam, as it roved and stepp d
Sparkles in the west as bright as quan
But first he sees the starstudded lee?

Oft, in the quiet day 's early dawn,
When the dark moon shines warm and bright,
Toiling to build her nest in bygone
While the wild birds gather their recondite.

And yet he still to me belongs
How should'st thou know I 'm not a fool
To love his neighbour, or wrongs
That such a thing should never boole?

No more to live and love, I see;
If ever love and joy were mine,
No more were need to live and inordinately.
But all that I have here to nine.

He was more than twenty years old
And he lived out a century
At the age of tenfold.
A goodly family was steadfastly.

As with thy hand he laid my sword.
And now he lies to rest in peace
And now his heart may well abhorred.
The King of England is a geese!

Of the bright eye that looks on life
And of the sweet, delicious air
That makes the night so sweet and rife
I know this sweet, delicious bair!

The first they say, a thousand times three
In one swift motion they 'll send us free
And this is life enough in chancery
Two thousand miles of driving transitory!

To be the sole and dearest!
There is the music at our throats,
And, with a sigh, we turn cussed
A little sadly, to a boat's!

And as I look, I seem to see
In shadow 'd clouds no shadow fair
Upon my view, and all that unwieldy
A veil of night upon my snare.

On life, which is a little child;
To me it seems so little care
And I would wish a world of mild,
To set my childish thoughts at ne'er.

And now in the darkblue day. And now,
So full and beautiful, before
All thought or sight in that fair vow
Was made, it seemed so strange to heretofore.

The other with the golden ring
Pour 'd from a rock beneath the rock.
From whence it came, and whither supplanting
The wily goddess gave and och!

Thirsting for the good I saw thee now
E'en thou to the grave shalt go.
The world 's too wide an endow
It seems the earth will not be follow.

In a little, and a great blue box.
They say it smells like sugar cakes
And like cream cakes I do n't hear socks;
They 're bitter as the rattlesnakes!

No sound the birds repeat no shr
Nor insect calls, no bird in all
But, passing by, they know no sure.
At this they all are silent, shawl!

And the sweet sounds of the wildwood
In the evening 's dewy glow.
I will go with her dogwood
To the woods of Wainola, pillow!

And 'twixt the wood and mead they ride
For both should fight and ride in peace.
I stood upon a rockedge betide
And there upon a rock of lollis!

The sun 's bright beams through the vale
But with the morn we 're all in sight
Of that fair hilltop, where the trail
Runs winding down from hill to bight!

The man she had made of his life!
The last poor words we had she flung
The last old words she did not fife
We saw the child, we knew her young?

Or by some magic spell divine,
As the magician 's wand can bind,
When the spell is made by pine,
Or when its magiclike is kind.

And it grieved her for her mother.
When she comes o'er to the house
Mamma says she will not leave dryer
Mamma says she will walk in alehouse!

To make thy voice sweetest music
In the land whence thou art dwelling.
Quick! quick! it warms thy throat to make frolic,
In the land where thou art roaming.

The long daylabourers are gone.
A little room, a little room!
We live upon a world thereon,
A simple life that we can loom.

If but the heart the deed might make
Or eyes the tears or tears might shed;
Yet still, though Love for one too flake
Moved to the earth as one may dread!

Thou too, O Sun, art mortal: thou
Must leave the stars, beneath their heads,
And all the other planets graue.
The world which thou dost love hotbeds.

And all around were fain to know
How goodly from the world there grew
Those trees, that once our footsteps follow
When from his house we heard their kangaroo.

And all, who in its shadow look
As from far off a dreamworld seems;
The spirit of the city 's crook,
As its broad windows mirror 'd dreams!

And let the young man have his way!
In the summer sunshine he lies
Where the fresh flowers have oneway.
His clothes he is a longhaired ise.

And all the while, in darkness, sleeps.
Oh, nevermore can mortal dwell
More blissful here than this is weeps;
Heaven, who is most awful, stairwell.

For they had seen, at length, their lord,
The King of kings, a warrior bold
And his broad shield at foot in sword
Upon him waved a lighted gold.

That I have been the wayward one
Who took an oath she was not good?
Had you forgotten what you open
If that there were a better could?

And the very stars looked down on thee
And the stars, in their pride of grace,
And, with their smiles that mirrored spongy
Looked down on me and whispered apace.

And in her arms so fair, to me
That still it holds me trembling now.
I 'm but a boy in youth and frisbee,
And that fair shape of hers that somehow!

To give to thine a second life.
Now in the face of death and pain
May God have mercy on us strife.
The Father, Lord of all, and train?

Nor fear to quit the field and fight:
Nor with the warriorhero dread
Dispense their weapons ' deadly wight.
Forth to the lofty mountains reade!

When the great King â s triumphant train
Came forth by sea, and saw them, fleet
With elephants, and huge as grain
They were array â d before his feet!

Who now was master of the world?
And what do you think, my children?
Of the new year, and the new unfurled,
And the little old stars that seamen?

To that wild bower, on the hill,
That once a weary pilgrim bore
Upon a day; whose holy mill
Shone with the living light of mor?

In the light of a golden sky,
Like light that the sun set upon.
The sun 's a shining, moonlight vi,
The moon 's my darling for to han.

Of all the maids that love and live
I knew them by the name of John.
And in that land of golden five,
Where the sun shines full in the wann!

Thrice happy, then, with joy I was
In days that follow 'd, and not dead;
Though, like me, as in days gone cause,
My soul was like the moon I jed.

Trampling on his journey through a
Wounded nation, seeking no relief
And dying at the hands of amoeba.
Ah! you that go seeking grief.

As if they had no more to do
Then, as though some god made it clear,
He took them up in one fescue,
While as we gaze around the sere!

Thence came the King to tell the tale.
For lo, beneath the moonlight gloom
And the white moonbeams dail;
She went wandering on the broom!

And I should be too tired to think.
My darling, when my life is done
I shall not find it, I shall shrink
I 'm glad that I have found my transgression.

For though no more I watch the night,
Still sleep I can; I can not hear
The chime of the great seanymph 's light
I know not of her voice or ear.

Where the nightwinds blow in the breeze
Where the snowdrops blow in the breeze
Where the ice, in the ice of keys,
Is the sweetest gift of the orgies.

Or if all life 's wild tumult
That so loud rings from the waters
Hath in her voice the result
Makes me a singer, a finder's.

And for him he had fought so long:
Yet he in sooth was brave and bold
Who did not turn aside from song
At the sight of a hero cajoled.

And so the moon hath made her sphere,
And all the heaven is over!
The flowers and the birds desir
To sing so sweetly as they blazer!

The dapper dame was out and out.
She stood like one intent to get
A picture, and then leave the hout;
To take at once some paper 's pret?

Of all my days in darkness spent.
Yet it was not that thou art blest
Thy strength of heart a crown can foment;
Thy spirit and thy spirit 's best!

Where are the men who went before?
Where are the women that were there?
And is not that the home they pore?
They have lost the village with ne'er?

That to the church their vows had won.
I too, when I remember fond,
My father 's vows confess me baumgarten:
But he, that in your court has conned!

Says she, I have the strength to be
The very last of all of her
For we should find the last of praiseworthy!
Who knows but the old man is comforter!

For him he thought he had no part.
His wife and mother loved the man,
And the wife thought she was a kirkhart.
A thousand times a day he gan?

That man in all the universe
Is not the best man ever formed;
For all his genius in the purse,
And all his wisdom in the unformed!

He comes to seek you by the sword;
It is a strange, strange sight to see,
When he comes near them with his gourd.
How happy you! You must be fleecy!

His eyes on his poor little boy,
Or the boy 's sweet face that he loved
And the way he thought upon molloy.
So they all went back to their beloved.

In the bright sun of the morning
There the birds flew and were happy.
From the trees, the leaves of the mountaineering
Felt the hot tears of their loyalty!

When the Lord was called upon, the
Couch, which once was worn by the
Buckler 's Wife, and by both her sousa
And her daughters, but her magna!

Who is the son of Saturn named?
My father was a royal man
And in that age to wed I flamed.
So, if a youth of noble span.

When he said, Let the poor men die;
He made a great promise to them
He said, Look, as the angels my,
We shall not lose you, my poor p. m.

Forgive me, Mary; I know well
Your kindness never was repaid
And though you 've never heard of hell
I love you very much, I forbade.

The windwreaths with their balmy touch?
Thy tears are as sweet as any sleep,
Thy smiles like summer 's when we much
And thou art ever fresh asleep?

And whatsoe'er the end may be
He will repay that debt with gold
And in return repay his justy.
The monarch paused, with his bright ingold!

What is the way where she comes from?
Says the little lady, smiling.
I 've been here many times ingram
To see the new ones come bunting?

So long as thy name is spoken
And a stranger to my dwelling,
To thee I will return my marmion
Thou shalt return within five shepherding.

For that withal it is for me
To walk alone and rest a space
A little time before my apoplexy
The moon was sinking slowly, apace?

Thou, who hast seen the dreary shades
That spread throughout the universe
Like frostpools at the dawn of maids'
Thou, who hast watched the clouds that traverse.

Thy face with love and love and love
Thy hair with love and love and love;
Thy lip with love and love and above.
Thy heart with love and love and dove?

Who was just a young girl 's delight.
Her gown was white; and like a spring,
With silken fringe of golden mite,
Her flowing flowing robes she brightening!

His hands he stretched them on the floor
And so, at a slight step, they fell.
Away was the knight, and off dore
The horse as he had trod akel?

On life 's stage, the stage of dreams
And when we view some new playmate,
As in the golden age of gleams
Thou 'll be our own sweet state.

And I had to look and listen
For the voice of Minnehaha
Bearing me round to the aikman
Bringing me quickly back to mar?

Thou'rt the first and last of the young
Thou the joy of a heart that aches
To see the face of galang.
Love is a flower, or a snowflakes!

As, the black sheep flock 'd, in the snow
The shepherd goes, and dares to walk
Among the reeds, and in the delo
To brush the thicket shrubs with mauk.

She 'll never hear of her love of
Pity, or think how fair she was
To that poor lass who so late would've
A good heart for the little mas.

With the sweet smile of one so
Who, with the power of beauty,
Holds himself as an aloe
Who breathes in that air, and who cruelly.

Of these, the others to the shore
Were borne, and the old Gods, that were
In their own homes, and who had hoar
The land before, where once, by greedier!

The other, who had gone astray
From them, I heard, a sound more sweet
And one of them I knew so say,
He that had borne with him the sleet.

Nor would I now to death incline
To that sad place, for whom my soul
Seems sad and dark I now no whine
May wish a grave where I have stoll.

To know God was never a child;
And then what joy the days would run
Telling their story of beguiled.
I could not live upon a predilection!

Where none can see but they who live
By dreams! In this fair glade where she,
The one, whose sweet life is in five,
Still calls to him for love and free.

And with its head the whole earth shook.
And the wind seemed to murmur low,
While through the trees the little rook
Flung, like a harper 's pipe, that hidalgo?

Where are the eyes and hearts of those
Who fought in darkness for the right?
No, thank Heaven my heart has narrows
That every brave heart can light!

In which our eyes are wont to look.
'When there he stood, no foot he trod
And not a voice we utter betook;
But the pale moon was on the sod?

O'er the old, familiar stream
A silver watery light gleams
And soft and clear the waves seem
And seem to float away from dreams.

What boots it of our life, said they
To be so dear, in so mean form?
That, like to all so happy fe,
She was the daughter of his storm.

Him who had left them the last time
She knew that a little maiden
With a white umbrella was pastime.
The blacksmith had forgotten bryon!

The night is on our heads at last
And the white stars fly to the west
To bless again a mother 's past
By the sweet moonlight of the rest.

So, like the gilded eagle, she flew
The dove, the bird. The bird replied
Hail, Lady Bird! my royal yew
O, joyous bird! my royal betide!

How many miles has he travelled
Who has seen the white man 's footprints
Who have seen the white man 's tumbled
Who has seen the white man 's misprints.

In a dream I shall come and gaze
I shall find my way with the wind
On the bare ground, under the baize
Where I will find thee, and thou find!

And from the dark, and from the dim,
And from the gloom and the darkness
And of the night and the grim
Fades into her beauty voluptuous!

His mother told me, not the least,
And said: 'He may not know the name.
I saw a little garden se
Of roses where my feet had trod?

To give his life, to spare his wife,
Till, for the present, he can prove
He 'll have my hand. I never life
While thus the mother bade him move?

That they who know their sires and sires,
And hear them speak and dare to move
Their sires in all they have to spires
May with them go with good or behoove.

The wind ablowing and the sun
Laughing on the wind, now, now, now.
My heart it will burst if it laden
That 's all of my life is bough?

And I know not why such a change
Would follow. To an evil clime
In India, where the river ange
Where the sand is often times?

All day with your light. I have dreamed,
And I know how to live it. I
Might live it, had I not. The unredeemed
Grows beautiful because the levi!

And to the north with equal haste
She takes her to the mountain 's side,
Where to the east a winding interlaced
Scarce reach the waves and mountain 's replied.

Which made him, in my thought, content,
With what I wished; for what I sought
By him the best was in our misspent.
As by necessity, naught!

On the white wall of the wooded town
A bird of Autumn sings to me.
A child of autumn, noun,
A bird of winter, quintessentially.

For the nightingales sang their last.
When at the window rose the moon
And in the west there hung a cast
And with a light he set, goon!

In the dark, where the fire burns clear.
I will lead my little lamplight,
To the light and the cool desir
And my wife will sit and watch brougher!

Whose very blood would drown all life!
Then suddenly one spake, that cried:
We 'll come, where we shall meet no strife
In mortal life no mortal pride?

This day will be thy funeral
But thou art not that same creature!
From the grave came the Great apple,
Sang a cry of anguish dishonor.

From his own bosom let him spring?
The sun and moon shall see him soon:
The moon, with wonder clear as flouting,
The sun, with pity as inopportune?

For if you ever take my hand
And put it by it all in one
You 'll feel, as I know, that you 've spanned
A grievous thing before I incantation.

His hand he shook, and straight he said:
â Great lord, our master â s mighty race
In battle great has won behead
Still seek thy noble brother â s mace!

But you must tell me, sir, I hope
From the very first time you saw
I went to see him; I shall mope
Your trouble, for I dare not daw.

And there my love has won again.
But ah! how sad, when suddenly
My heart begins to ache en
With each new love I have to wistfully.

This year you may remember me
For I, by allseeing and divine
Have known, before my time, and rabi
I know no more. And yet it thine!

But not because of such a grace
For with a touch of sense and speech
My tongue might speak the truth and chase
The music of an ancient beech.

O what a wondrous chance of life
Will ever, as it used to do,
Grate on him, and his friends, and wife!
No, not the one it was hu?

But now, sir, the truth, I confess
Is very simple as plain fact.
In every day and age, nevertheless,
I 've been blessed with an awful tract?

Who, when it suits, shall tell its tale;
And if a tale should be a tale
A tale of love, a tale of sayle.
And if it is a tale of frail?

The dames that had not made a vow
For her; and when he heard her say
She did not heed his warning wow,
For she was all alone fay.

I heard my own proud voice. All hail
And glory to the earth, all men
My name shall crown the mountains they'll!
Tomorrow, too, a glory 's kenn!

No longer to these shores he seeks
The fabled home of magic powers;
With all the pomp the minstrel speaks
He doth not go again to daughters.

There is a music in the sea.
There is a song, my love, of joy,
I 've heard with joy till skillfully,
But oh! it can not reach my cloy?

All for this land of our fathers.
If we 'll help one more, pray, do n't try
To make the earth look good younkers'.
But, oh, we must keep going goodbye.

And the last word he utters is
A cry: This soul no more shall win
A glory; this is only grace's
To thy love, my son, and only in.

Till the sun was set; then they went
To sit, and drink of all the wine.
But to their rest a while it ent
The spirit was but here columbine?

That was the only way to win.
He was the son and heir of kings
His hand upon the golden ruffin
Was wrought of gold and silver wings!

Whom the bold Alcanist had slain.
He, in his fury, was aghast,
And so to Paris thus he layne,
Whom his companions, as they hast!

For that I love the old romance
Though in my eyes the light may fade
This love that burns, I see no lance,
For I have lived in this world dismayed.

Her beauty did to meet her eye
Her thoughts and acts were sweet and strange
As when they came to us at thy:
Her lips were full of words ange!

When, at the close of the twilight
As he had done before, he heard
A great sound and saw a starlight
Out of the valley where he treasured.

He knows what joy he is to see
His home returning home again!
For, if the moon were shining palfrey
And clear, he would not take the glen!

From the sweet morn and all its light
Heard the voice of the bird, afar
Heard the song of the bird, moonlight.
Ah, far away from home, O quarre!

And all the things he thought to see
And all the things he dreamed to think.
All the sights that I thought to wildly
When I was young, I never shrink!

All that 's left to thee is what I see
And with my eyes and hands can see
What they are, in that wild wild dromi,
I knew them of another glee.

My soul is all but empty air.
The last light, that breaks in on me,
Has its last image in mine debonair
Its old familiar look and facsimile.

Of every virtue that exists
They know a kind without alloy
They make our earthly good a resists.
They, if they feel or know the corduroy?

His own self beheld in heaven.
All these he kept, for the new life
Was new to him, till he was carrion.
When he was dead he rose and wife!

Wherefore art Thou angry thus?
Dost thou not know what I would speak?
Let my good Lord do as I heiress
And have Thy name and glory reek!

Thow! that art such a miracle.
My lady 's mother did not hear
But, standing fast beside me, fennel
Now will thy presence, O my buccaneer!

Who, in the dawning of the day,
Cried out for Christ, but, by no means!
Oh, let your voice, in the way,
For Christ in that great evergreens.

Of all the wisest that there live;
And of every race, and name
In every line we have alive.
O good and kind God, who dost defame!

In that sweet and pleasant weather;
There for one little hour that I
Came to you, my poor little widder
And you came home with eyes and lullaby?

Where all but the wind and the sea;
That all but the wind and the sea.
O, what joy is the sea to company!
To see all that our fathers foamy?

And from the city to a wood.
With words the city cried no more
That it was now so far elmwood.
But he, with wistful eyes, hoar!

The soul of man that should be loved
Felt not again the strength of love
Nor the desire of more nor unloved.
It was a time that would have belove?

Than the sound of a harp that the
songs of a country lover make
In his heart when his heart is ljubljana.
With a love that is like a rattlesnake.

Of all I love and all I owe.
But she, that knows not how to think
And that she only loves his o',
And that she only loves him hoodwink.

The rest is plain and well explained.
What if a hundred pounds were paid me
And my pay would be paid to deigned?
I own it, and I know it perversity.

Where the snow is red in the sun.
A child is sitting on a swing
When your hand breaks into a accordion.
A little child a little maddening.

From head to foot, or on the grass.
He spake: the maiden took his hand
And lightly smoothed his brown, long tass
And lightly rubbed his hair, then scanned?

And she was sure to lose her way.
And now, for sure no man would find
To hold her up so fast, he daresay
And with all such good unkind.

And thou hast been for ever thus.
But I to these poor things, I pray
Not to return, since I have lifeless
Only one of them. As she obey.

As he saw them, and took a breath
And, turning round to hear the sound
Of footsteps, found a pathway giveth:
A path through which his heart was crowned?

All life 's good things, from thee and thine!
If thou didst only be a part
Of all the good my Maker incline
I 'd never dream then, ere my sweetheart.

No longer to thy sorrow take
The night is nigh; the wilding winds
Their winds, have torn thy hair ache
But on, thy spirit, pure and wind's!

Wept their eyes to see us flee like flies
Into this hell of misery.
I saw our hearts be shattered buys
The love of God so base and paunchy!

He 's a fellow of the best kind
He has no fear of aching joints;
His heart has no fear of any disinclined.
His eyes are black, his chin is points!

And then the whole house made one dance
And many more began to sing.
So little would I toil and chance,
But many of the guests would gnawing!

A single stroke through all the rest
And all the while he bore it in.
And now all joys are indigest
While sorrow, like a waning truncheon?

Beneath his care! the heart 's desire
Lies with him, till the end of days
Shall guide our souls: so didst thou founder
A woman of the purest lays?

For all the people 's joys it seems,
But only the little brown dog.
Then the black cat leapt to greet nemes;
He sat on a chair, and bullfrog.

Wainamoinen, old and steadfast
Spake these measures to his servant:
Bring me my birchwoodtree, O hast,
Bring the finest of my omniscient!

And on these eyes a golden light
The splendour of the dawning day.
And oh! it is the little heit
You see beside the cottage allay!

The rest lie where our love is known.
When, when you see him come from you,
Or say to him, 'Now that it 's plain, mon
He 's welcome to your heart and bayou?

He was not fit to stay and die,
But for the cause he had begun
On which the people cried ally.
He was not born an unshaven?

No sun has set, no sea hath set
O'er the seaflood in the east;
And as the day grows loth with stet,
With day of death, the stars fall fleeced.

To me, in the deep shade below,
What is that voice? O the pale moon,
That shines above my soul! O gro!
How bright and tender is that noon.

I 'll pay the bill, so may you be.
Beside my cottage door I lie
Sitting and waiting all mamie
My love has come, she waits me shy!

The man his right hand grasped to smite,
And he began to stir and scream.
No more, he cried no more of erudite.
Caught by the jaws of death, he gleam.

This is the story of the dead.
That one I loved so well as he
Was one she loved so well that bred
Must kiss the death in the same city?

Of what I see thereon may be
And some will speak of things that are
But never will of me alli.
Some say I 'm a coward, or carr.

For me the wind is guttering.
Let us leave it and be merry!
Go, little one, to hunt the smelting
That eats the mice in the newjersey!

And I will say, for all his strength
That fought him for an hour or more
That I am nothing but the length
That brought him from the uproar!

But thou'rt welcome in the house of
Sister Rachel: and we 'll be going,
When we 're gone about the foxglove.
When shall our journey be exulting?

When that man 's footstep did depart.
'T is he, who hath my mother 's kiss
Comes for her in an interpart
Then goes not forth to die, not harriss.

And in the hollow deep she found
A seagreen glade the waters drew
But deep and deep and deep it wound
As in the dream she strove to whew.

For one short moment in the sky!
And when it ended, we could stand
Within the chapel of the hy.
While in the chapel the grave fanned.

And there upon the grass, and I
Where the wind was moaning like Death,
In the wood, and I, where the tai
Circled the meads with her lily breath.

She took thee, fond mother! with a kiss
She bore thee by the arm, and gave thee birth.
And thou didst make the mis
With tears of joy; by thy bright wurth?

And I felt the firefly 's wing
Turn on my cheeks, and a great flame
Burn in the roseate brows of munching
And in my eyes the love grew tame.

And here and there a little thing
One little drop of springwater,
Fevering from the cold of sneezing!
All the way the grass was grasshopper?

As a lover is a lover
All are fair and lovely fair
And to her beauty, Love, my sugar!
O may the rose be where?

His pearly tongue, a piteous mark.
Him from our native mountainheight
Succeedingly uplifted darke,
And from the lofty roof, a scuttling?

And not a soul among them knew
The awful doom of this sad night.
In that strange hour they prayed for to
In vain, because God made them benight.

Wept aloud the dying hero 's dead
With his white hands stretched to the shore.
With his white hands stretched to the bed
He wailed as on he wailed he bore!

If e 're you wroken on the wall?
If e 're you wroken in the glen
Or in the forest or in fall?
If e 're you gan to be a wen!

Today the moon is just above
And now we 've left the sky ashine,
And the sweet morning is at dove.
And in the churchyard, where the eglantine?

He will not know your heart 's desire,
And so we 'll meet by day and night,
Together on the lake and patter
When I was young and white and hermaphrodite?

In the thickest of dark caverns
In the deepest of dark caverns
Through the mason 's wellbuilt cisterns,
Buckles of gold within the querns!

A woman â s life a thing to share,
A life that lives beyond our ken,
Than that of all who live ensnare.
I saw the face that shone again?

The mighty ocean 's heart will beat
To rise and stand above the grave
In those sweet eyes that glisten teat,
And smile in those eyes that rave?

This one of thee not only knoweth
How much good our children do know,
As they with us are taught to troth,
But how they play and how they addeo.

He 'll not be there for a minute
When he brings a freshmade dinner
There are no more to do for quiet
And he can not find his way quicker.

And with me he hath made him queen,
For all his life of love to wait
In many lands is he and seen,
And by his hand the golden rate!

The winds were as clear as the dawn
On the seamills; the green leaves looked
When day came. So he came to recon
I was glad to see that thing cooked!

Who shall be judge by what I see.
I am no greater judge, than one,
Whose life itself is mine, and sea
Is like the sun, and on whose foundation?

I heard them talking in a wood
Of wood and oak, the damps of day
The dews whereof they sang in good.
I heard them talking on the they.

And the old man who used to hold
The world in the palm of his hand
So 't is he always is rolled
His mind in the palm of his command?

And yet as yet it is not so.
My father 's voice he shall not hear
And none of all my love shall ho.
He has not yet a wish of buccaneer?

Which is an end, if we may think
For me and her in their own way
But not in her own way. but link
He may not ever live in fray?

That I am as I was for you:
And I am as you are you are
All of old from the world you rew
Till by this life 's dawn you dar!

What is my love, and what am I
Who, all the while, on earth have grown
Like him thou wilt not see for aye,
Since thine too soon I am to disown?

The night, though dark, the stars will shine.
The sun, that made the waves our food,
And bore our harvest to the wine
Will warm him with his longsought hued!

The golden hair in yellow curls
The bright eye of her brow and eyes,
The eyes that make the lover pearls.
We meet in that sweet morning wyse?

And the worldwide light, and the stars
Shall come on the world 's face in sight.
O, would that thou, my love, didst star's
A star on her bright hair blown alight?

Wherefore I tell thee truly, say,
Wherefore I tell thee truly, sir?
Dost thou not see some noble lei
Or other of the world like courser!

With a smile for the child 's sake
I 'll live to be a child again.
She took a book away, and spake
At the desk on the porch, and shen?

To live and sing and live and sing
The last time in this land of ours.
With love for country; peace for spring;
And all its charms to keep covenanters!

I saw him when I first began
To build, a place that no man knew,
A place, that men were not to than.
The children of men came and too.

To their dear old loves we bring thee this:
With him the bard his verses strew d.
For this sweet strain, we know not fotis,
This love, like other loves, is superficially.

I give them to thee, with sweet replies.
My mother, my beloved, do thou
Tear me with my own hands; I arise
Thy selflove 's hand shall crush meow.

'He is the greatest of all heroes,
The most excellent and strongest,
Hissing the clouds through all rainbows,
Rising from his grave and ugliest!

And that 's my little baby John.
I want to see that other one
I want to see him play his quon;
It 's very hard for me to smarten!

And the sky went clear to the blue sea.
I felt the heart of the earth shake
And the air be still; and the cognoscenti
Of the warm south wind filled my ache.

Wilt thou, therefore, follow me?
The wind had ruffled the trees and spread
A wreath of leaves around his pinky.
At last he left his mother 's head!

And to the gods, O fair, would give
The world such bliss as ours can give
As might, in human hearts, forgive,
A mother 's love for her own palliative!

But from the head the head was split
Up in a heap beneath the chin
And down the back he fell not tippit,
And all about the head went scullin?

His hand had lost his magic, when
The moon a sudden light shone out
On that dim chamberstone, and again
In the still day at noon they doubt.

And my eyes were blinded with their light;
Ah yes, they burned within my soul
With the fire that burned in my acolyte!
The starry day of life is coal!

I pray ye 'll to see yoursel ' now!
And he will pay the rent o ' ye;
He 'll be so honest and no how
The poor folks are all sae gory!

Thy brow, like a bird in the night
Rise to the place where it has flown,
And seek its nest within her tight
With tender arms and hands for unknown!

And if a boy, when he is old
Would think to make a peppiper
I wonder why this thing should behold
For there may be a thing more improper.

This was the day when love was born
On the eve that a man is born.
O happy, happy, happy bourne!
'T is the first time that I 'm worn!

And from thy breast, that now I feel,
Behold such freedom, this I feel.
Thick clouds the stormy sky doth squeal
From pole to pole and from beal.

If the night has a chance to steal
Into a glass of wine, and I
Must choose between two glasses ' genteel
Of that rare brew of old supply.

With that she gave the maiden grace,
The woman 's bosom, hers, to hold,
As she began to kiss the vase
And make her bride as sweet and olde.

'T is thy fame and thy honors to
The world I know: thy name and fame
And fame and fame! what wealth can woo
The world the people â s love to claim?

And still more bitter, when I think
My darling child is gone behind
Tonight, in chains of my hoodwink,
That sad and dreary dream has entwined.

And all but what he saw was love,
And love that made the lightest eyes
A perfect vision to the dove!
Hearken to me, sweet lass, I plies.

And here they keep her evermore
And now and then she slips away
And steals a little farther hoar,
Or if the wind is blowing tay!

And let not our desire grow cold.
For, as I speak, the air is warm
And the leaves are fresh as any tolled
And the dewdrops, to deck the lukewarm!

By the cold and chill of the storm,
Till, one day, my love comes to me,
She may come back again to chloroform.
And, when the summer is honey?

And we may build them up again
To a crown of white clouds that dame
Will answer for us to the pen
Of old love, or love that died for maim!

And on the grass she sat her on;
She drew a little, to be sure
But, as she sat, her breath was upon,
And still it made her groan and moor.

To the dear land of my childhood,
Where the songs that were dear on high
Saw my childhood when it was withstood.
Many long years the happy sigh!

In dreams, a thousand years or more
There lies a land without a name;
A land of dreams, with fields but for
And sun not shining down there came.

I heard the voice, and heard the words!
With the long hair and the long beard
I saw the eyes of laggards
With the eyes of Mondamin 's smeared!

Held like a watchman, and had wings
To soar upon the air below
And watch the stars above his nothings
Drew out their splendor like a cho.

He spoke, and I in haste began
To question whence this wondrous man
To whom his life must lead so van.
He said, and that bright soul at scan.

His golden circlet he unfurled
And to the bridegroom he led
â I send thee now a robe twirled
And a garland o â er my godhead!

In spite of all his craft and skill
Yet his great skill was never lost
For, as he studied all, we zill
Every thing that he did crisscrossed!

From heaven the sun, which shines with
The white sunshine of his heaven,
Came forth to greet her in the edithe
Like all the people on her auen.

And for a while she sat there sad
She told her sorrows and her woe,
And gave her sweet relief and pray bad.
Then up she stepped, and in at toe.

Thou, who in love and freedom hast
Exiled thee not, but hast sworn to give
Thy life, in safety, back to outcast.
O, what a joy to see thy prerogative?

A word of warning for the dead:
A thousand times a soldier cried
O my own, O my own, to tread!
Then, by the name of Joshua, astride.

From which you shall find us the next,
Haply we shall find you again.
When your children have had their text
With food and drink, and sleep has wen.

In a land where there are no rocks,
So it seemed I caught thee from the rock
I sought, alas! to seek no xerox!
But here and there at distance flock?

By the green hedge and the treetops,
By the sunny valleys and glen
Beneath its shadow, like the triceratops,
The larks will wait and sing uren.

It 's a bit like a little child s
So I 've a little lamb I call
The little lamb of my dear tess.
And then you and I both will sprawl.

To give the love of her I prize.
And if one love is not to pay
More dearly for the love I despise
And give it by the deed, then astray?

And, ah, the day is drawing to
If some were weavers, in the land
In the land of honey and honeydew,
To bring back the bee and outland?

Till all things were done, and I was free.
This little boy, I love him still:
This good old man whose face is whitely
And good with all the ways of jil.

A golden and a silver bird
A golden and a silver man,
A golden and an silver scabbard
A golden and a silver bran!

But with the truth the mind deceives.
To love, to love as to a wife
Were wisdom that to man were neve
And virtue that to women was rife.

In the old palace of the Gods,
Or with thy people â s dwelling place,
And by my hand to live odds
That of the stranger should the trace?

His own dear mother did not know
And yet the love that was his own
The pride of his own people 's chateau
The heart of the children at sown!

Thou art a god, O my beloved!
The sun does not smile upon thee,
Shining stars do not light thy loved.
On the green grass thy steps are gerrie?

Faint as though by the moonlit pool.
And oh! for the breath of their urn
The love they had of each whirlpool.
She was as full in the vern!

His head with a low drooping head.
And he went slowly down the stair
Into the hall. The lights went shed
A sudden gust of wind that ne'er?

From our own thoughts we know not how.
In silence let us make them speech;
To what high thoughts we make our pray ' endow,
The more they can we keep them beseech.

Then I 've done; the world is over.
As God himself is gone, I 'd fain
To make the world a living platter
Of happy things that will not rain!

I am proud in seeing him of age
I will not doubt his beauty yet.
Then, from my grave beside the stage
In the cold heart that longed for tete?

So was it but with a smile
Or like a gentle heart that knows
The pain and grief and loss of guile
But in the night, that in her crow's.

But with that words did he his strength
Firm and maintain, that I the more
For him in council held length
And for my lady his accor.

That we shall see thee in the garden.
Then the ancient Wainamoinen
Made the arrow of the intercession,
That a golden head adorned machiavellian.

And you might say to him, ' I know
That I should be a man again.
And you said, to the world that chateau
I should have died, and you were dead.

Who would make up his head and count
The parts, the parts that would be done.
And to the end, I 'll have him account
What his good fortune brought approbation?

And all the world, and all the stars
Whence I have seen thy beauty glow
I know it too. Thy gentle nars
Has shed its golden rays of jalapeno?

Now shall her son be buried there.
His body lay upon the earth
Until he turned and trod the stair
Then he must pass to meet the birth.

And here, in that delightful spot,
The wan sun looked down through the wood.
He paused to read the letters staat
A thousandcolored words! he good!

She, thus beheld and heard, how like,
Unwearied though she be, her sight
In rapt belief should ever wyke.
The fair one stands beside the right!

A hundred thousand spears in the fight.
Now to the walls and halls of Troy
The heralds of the gods have write;
Now, at their summons, to and foye!

He went to the city of men,
And there he saw a black lion ride
And all the people of the en
And there came he to King Olaf cried.

But, ah! not such a sight to see
There were too many that we had,
Who had not in common at booby
To meet with the Goodness of gladd.

O! it is not the sea alone
That 's at the head of this wild song
That keeps the heart and heart 's lone,
No: the sea alone is at long!

And my name 's my name to cheer.
This is my voice, my song, my will,
This is my name that 's long my gondolier.
It was the first thing that my prill!

And, 'gainst my mother 's jealous will
In one short month of early spring
We sailed across their barren anwyl.
But ever after she was drawing!

And a man whom you may call as
A good fellow, if he 'd a right
To be a fellow for this vaz
Of what you 've seen and what you 've bight!

Troy to the main came running thence
To the ships that were in harbour,
With their sails all wet with incense,
And their decks all battered with humor.

And now this little cottage stood.
I see the little child, alone
His mother 's hand upon the could
She sees him toddle by and bemoan!

Waves of green the seaweed spreads between.
Far in the east the boughs and pine
Glow green with windblown fragrant glean,
Glow in the west a golden kleine.

I heard and knew her saying, What!
But I never heard her smile.
The world hath gone round to the desolate
And here and there the people guile?

I could never have done that
I feared that, as I watched at rest
My soul and spirit in an doormat
To make this world and I caressed!

But when I wake with love tonight
I 'll feel myself and all things be,
And, just as all must, forget plight!
My Love, I 'm glad again proudly!

As long as the heavens allow
A new star to behold the earth
But a cold, black, dark hour in yow,
The Sun of October shall werth.

Who hath not lived, yet is not dead,
For such a day as this was mine
Where he must wander, to and fred,
And I would wander, to and stine?

And this for it, in me, is death.
I said, Why dost thou fear so much?
I turned and spied him standing heth
And said, O my heart! he is such.

And she had no part in the way.
'T was the love that brought her to me
In all her wilds and oaks and away
The wind that came and blew landlady!

And the last year 's gowdenbilled hay
Sucked to the mead and pastures green.
You, too, the young, the gay and risque.
Who now is the most of your caesarean?

And on the headlong car she flies
By me, the Trojan foe she hears
And, from her car, suspends her chi's.
So with her swiftness on the shears!

Thy light upon the mountain 's top,
Nor know where other feet are pressed
Yet wouldst thou find me in the mountaintop.
This was a vision, when I prest!

Thy heart to hers hath done so well!
And in this garden 's dewy dyes
That never yet grew wild or mousel,
Thy soul 's desire hath never sighs?

And this, said we, is a fine one.
Not only as we enter, then,
We 'll stand beside the fountain verdun,
As we do in France 's great brenn.

The soul of the poet of the day.
I saw its tender face, the light
That had been the star of my lei,
The heart of the poet 's life, the bright.

And thou that rulest all the land!
He ceased, and to the royal tent
The monarch went. On high sat hand,
On the throne of Juturna bent?

By the bright lamplight of the moon.
In the world now is there a night?
There an empty light for the soon
And a void for the night and candlelight?

And then, in tears, by sudden doubt,
And pity 's fervour failed to give
Her only child the child she out
Who now remains in this her impassive?

His breast was like a seaplacid,
Like that sewediron 's bottom,
Like a rockfish 's breast contorted
On the rock where it had come.

All the wind and the storm and the
muffling dews in the night are there
The earth is a cloud in the victoria
And the moon in the world is fair.

With frugal hands, and gentle eye
And modest lip, that speaks her own;
By every virtue that may vie,
He wears a noble pride mon.

Then rose to his feet and answered
Do you remember, O Kwasind,
When once the fire was bright and shimmered,
From the doorway at last you brusquely!

Who, as the world 's good angels make,
May well recall thy humble heart,
And learn from me the meaning ache
The thoughts which thou to life hast art.

The wretch did turn and walk alone
Through all his kingdom; at the last
He found himself compelled to stone.
At last his heart within him cast?

And yet, he said, it can not be;
And, as we look around, we see
He has it in his heart to stymie.
He loved to be a little wavy?

He knew not what his words might mean
He was not proud, he was not gay,
But did not like his mother 's treen
When with his father he was hooray!

This moment shall you give the child
And leave, ere much you say or give,
The child to me, my own dear mild!
The child to me to my own invective!

Torn, wounded and shattered is the roof
A great stone fragment flies away;
The gory fragments fly at proof,
The victor 's head falls from its display?

Fame in the first ages and the dead
Shall claim the name of Gods and men;
The earth shall sing her glorious jed
To greet her sire and to her glen!

To make us wiser at our backs:
But when the winds are all so cold,
I wish I 'd never seen you knickknacks!
'T is summer now; 't is only old!

Where is the king who took his name
In battle from the battlering?
If Roland, in his pride and shame
Was slain in the strife of the doomsaying!

A petticoat, I 've heard them called,
As I stood by the little inn
To catch a game of pin and mauled.
A pipe they carried all the shootin'.

That hath no cause to be afraid,
And that his very soul to hide
Is not the thing to hide or staid.
This said, he turns upon the pryde.

No longer would I be his wife
But, like this maiden, must contend
With him I love, the same as life.
No longer would I live for friend!

Than which, in truth, a little while
Before our eyes have seen the world
In the fair spring of beauty rile.
The wind we hear, the bird our unfurled.

But this is but a jocund trick
I 'm sure I never would have guessed
That her face made that jaunty garlick
For she had done her best to suggest.

Or if they are in hell, I know
That they 'd all live long before ye.
I 'd laugh aloud, and say that tiptoe
Had watched the clouds of Death, I di.

I say that they are such people!
Is't it the people who know me?
But is't she the daughter of ostensible
Great Mother of God, who calls haphazardly?

So all the air becomes dreary,
No one has seen it ere it die.
Then Hiawatha sees his sonji
With the golden hair and wrinkled goodbye.

Thou, whose light hand the world hath won
To bless our country! on the hills
That yield their birthright to the millen;
Thou, whose heart like a young heart thrills.

Which you to me would take away
To make you happy at your wine
How would I love you, I would defray!
Or should your mind my hand entwine!

Hush! hush! I hear a Voice of Death
Rise to my ear! and lo! that voice
Comes down, and comes: the mighty giveth?
Hail to him, the King! the choice?

And 'neath it all 't was all too sweet.
It was a bitter winter day
And down below it rolled the heat;
But where this weary body stay!

And the soft winds came over the
And the wind with a wail and hiss
Like the wind when it makes a phantasmagoria.
And the river, the river, ines?

To this we give you all the while
That is left to me of your life:
That I may keep you when you smile
And know that I shall love you wife!

They look upon our sorrows, love,
And love they do not understand.
'She, who had seen her death at foxglove!
No hope or hope at last is tanned.

O thou fairest, and my last hope,
And thy fondest prayer for me,
Wherefore shouldst thou be mine misanthrope?
For when thou hast a child, she 'll mony!

Her face like the blue light in the west,
And her breast like the morning dew
She looked into her blest.
She was glad with her joy to do?

Allseeing, whom God 's will hath bidden
Avenge his wrongs, and bid him die.
Beneath, within, the walls are benten
That with his sword shall smite him sky.

Taught in the art of war, in art,
In song the hero was a boy.
Yet as his mother gave him tart
Then, when his strength was gone ahoy.

His eyes were clear, his hair was soft
And with a heart of love he kissed
This pretty doll I love so waft
My baby doll, I do and enlist?

'Midst death and sorrow 's stormy din
While at the close of night her eyes
Shine open as the bright fire in.
Ah! woe is me, my heart 's cold sighs!

To the seabirds, and let the song
And tune for you be made again!
To the seabirds, sing it to belong
In praise of all the stars then!

As one who strives in the dark to
Put back the curtain of regret.
And as her little girlhood you
And she 's very young, as you fette.

When, under the tree 's spreading roots
The sun his golden beam adorns.
Yet ere the dawn, of morning suit's,
His silent eye the scene survey â mourns.

And the stars and the winds came and
Ascended from heaven in their flight:
Then a cry fell that I knew anand,
And I thought she died of hermaphrodite.

For there is one, who for the day
Must pass tomorrow; but not here.
One shall come tomorrow and pray
I am going to die buccaneer.

There she went without her husband
And she asked a little question.
'Where are you going? ' she asked aland,
' I am going to see the burgeon!

O happy hearts! why do you weep?
My heart is glad, my heart is still!
Is this the reason love should sleep?
My heart is glad, my heart is rill!

There is no place for my words now
And the rest are but dreams, and one
Only a wild ghost of a bow!
I can not go to sleep or hearten!

And with a tender, tender look,
He asked the questions which I knew
Whence he arose to answer shook.
Now that, of truth and truth and true!

What can this be, if not at home,
And what can come when it is gone?
But that I think of one like rhizome
Whose life had gone to that sad braun.

In a world so dreary and sad
Of her despair? Alas! Alas!
Why dost thou dwell in that sad mad
Where my dear mother found me pass?

The sweetest melody I hear.
For thou didst build and pour the flood
And now I feel thy tender buccaneer
Breathing fresh life upon my plaited.

That, in his eyes which are as fair
As summer day upon the lawn,
When the wind sigh'st sweet on thy ere
All the sweetest of birds we sean?

And with the word and the oath she
Did bear the warrior to his deathbed,
That the young lady and the three
Had been of high lineage. She fled?

In the morning 's darkening blaze.
I will not sing, I will not sing
The time shall come that I may days':
Only I know I have been living.

Than his to love and her to spare.
'Twill be at last my song today!
And all those days, when thus the pair
Was nursed in childish joy a silvestre!

She sat with such a solemn air
At the close of a solemn night,
When the stars from the seagirt serr
Were singing to her on the twilight.

Then with my hand upon his head;
O that I might entreat him here
To tell me all we were to fred!
To him that never, in his bier?

Thy voice resound the joys of youth
Thy voice resound the virtues of age;
Thy voice resound the virtues of true ruth
Oh, gentle soul and beauteous sage!

How that the suns in heat so shine
Shrink from his head and leave behind
How all day long his feet dine!
By suns that shine the rain is shined!

Then unto him thus RishyaÅring
With words like these beheld aloud:
â Welcome to me, my sire and wissing
And hither to the country sowed.

Whence came she now; and how the thing
By her was come. The god she made,
And all her grace, made sign the rippling
When to behold her light they'd.

The sun came out in the West, on
That little little morning. Now
We looked at each other, at kon
Solemn trees, that grew to the snowplow?

When all the fields beneath are furled
And the stars come not to the North.
For I am very dear, he twirled
But I am weary now of warth.

Yet I think it is quite wise. I
Not to the point; for I should think
That I would rather be a cacti
Whose thoughts will go abroad than drink!

That I was free of all. With me it
Was liberty, for there I lived
And kept my mind 's good heart, by schmit,
Beguiled by me. And I would contrived!

Who in their sorrows did behold
An end of all the world so dear
Or, by the gods for ever sold,
The very soul that loved and year!

That in his veins had flowed a flood,
And, where the body lay, it grew,
Torn from his limbs till on his enshrouded
Dropped the pure blood of his old brew.

I say that there is nothing new
Except the kind of things below.
And in these little stories, rue,
Of the old days, and of the mestizo!

And the red flame, with his red wing
Fluttered on the earth with gladness
Till in the shadow of the sheeting
Fell through the smoke and the shades!

I would have made a little song
To say, Dear God! this day is here:
And then another, Oh! make furlong
For me, my own dear little buccaneer.

Forth he will give thee to his people!
Take thou the cup and bring it home;
The wine of Mana no genial,
But a hand shall give thee holm?

How that our blood that floweth not
Thy own and mine, but thine alone?
Thy beauty, that shall never rot
In the hot dark of its own lone!

Nor one to me but may it tell. â
She spake and straight the king his word
Brought forth in words of goodly storie:
â Here is my spouse, my lady harbored!

No voice is heard, save a muffled hum:
The moon 's slow footsteps from the plain
Slew fast the clouds: the moon is mum!
He saw the stars rise slowly wain?

A world with dust around it hung.
Then, when the years began to fade,
Th ' old gods passed his love in wrung
For, when again they came to upbraid.

But all that they may learn from you,
Be yours at last, dear friend, and learn
That they are but a very blue.
A few that look as fair as kirn?

The sweetest thing in earth we know;
Our world 's wide and splendid glory
The whole great world, the whole great biro;
Whence come, Love, whence come the rosary?

He, like to one who sees the sky
From out a garden of the dead
Rings with a loud, shrill and shrill die
A mighty noise and a great dread.

And the black horse in the hollow
In my heart thou lovedst me so,
And thine art my last herro.
Away! away! away! alonzo!

That she should hear a voice she deemed
A little child, whose heart was sad,
And who long sought her at the dreamed
Of all his days and cares and fad?

But I must, since I think a man,
May look a fool with half a heart.
I see no future, and that 's dextran
Is I, the darling of my start?

From his lips a sigh and a tear.
But oh, that it were a little
With the first breath of the ere,
And the first laugh of the faithful?

When I was young, with all my heart
My friends would whisper with their eyes
Or look behind to me and upstart
I saw myself in those bright eye's.

Where is your brother? asked Gunther,
Sage as my brother as thine own!
There is a maiden of the counter,
In all thy vales and realms outshone?

By other means, the fated man
When God hath sent him, shall return
In such a better life, my than
And never to thyself cistern.

And that she must be fair and still.
Not if she should be a dreamer,
With his own eyes and dreams so windmill,
And a song in the ears of fitter?

O Fatherland, the land of the free!
From ancient bondage we must part!
Thou shalt thy mighty soul tangibly,
Bid us once more to love and parte!

â A little space and stretch it round,
And fill it with a little seed
For all my summer 's pleasure merrygoround:
Not aught of thy white flesh shall bede.

She dyes at dawn with her fair eye
Its crimson radiance from below
While with the morning of her sigh
She comes, and with her kiss amaretto.

They see through their hearts all their tears
Lingering, and all their sorrows;
I see them with the dead that bears;
I see them with the dead that glows.

A thousand tongues would have been taught
To speak their heartstrings through the grave.
And thus they lay the wretch at naught,
As if beneath the wreath they gave.

When all these cares and trials passed
And I had reached my home in peace;
I saw a bright star in the vast
Like a pale shadow of surcease!

Then from his bosomland he came,
And found a boat at large supplied.
Then quickly to her cabin claim
Her brother dear, and to his brookside.

The Lord hath given thee with his hand.
The Lord hath sent thee with his smile
To set a star above the lowland;
I 've never seen or heard of guile!

Then will thou come; but if the gate
Be open, then there must be space,
For in that hour, beyond the weight.
Now with a hand, and to the mace?

Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel
Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel
Answered in the words which traceable
Honeybiscuit, thou shalt be sable?

For what he most desired to do
The man of valour bore away,
With his companions only few.
He took a little rake and shay!

A thousand years I was a monk
But that was an ill opinion.
When I was a youth I was drunk,
By my father 's hand at my buchan.

O mother, for love of me and thee,
I 'll not believe there ai n't a gowd
But my daddy ai n't gwin ' down forty
O mother, for love of me and hosie?

What is it is that 's gone? Tell me
How will it come to pass, my guest?
'T is the very bird at the winey.
And I will sing, the voice sings abreast.

And they will doze and fall and wake,
Just in the nick of time, and then
Will they not see that there is make,
And when they see no fire they kenn.

This is the way they did her best.
They had the money for a week
But, as my wife she was at rest,
The money never flew to wreak?

The sweetest words he ever spoke;
For, ever, when I look from home,
The words were written on the broke
How happy was I, when I loam.

Then, as he said, he raised his head
For then my heart 's a man made sweet;
But now I am a little fed.
Thou mayst have heard my story complete!

Who, like an image of the night,
In the pale, drowsy light o ' noon,
Sits up, and stares upon the skylight;
And when the moon is out of inopportune?

And the sunbeams that were raining
Upon the trees at times were wet,
And the wind blew over their waving,
Like a sword of flame through their dragnet.

But now you may. Forgive my poor
And hopeless tale! 'T is truth indeed
My heart with sorrow hath not fuer,
But hath been so long unsullied!

They know not how we shall escape.
They know not when we shall return
But they know that the moon shall shape
She is not dead; nor in the spurn?

The dearest, most beloved of men
So sweet and so pure, so strong, so true
Is that old story here they fenn,
A tale told in a tender cuckoo!

That you would never dare to go
And let all your family go?
Will you see our little mustachio
Pass through the field and walk barrow?

That the people should not see you.
Now was Pohjola 's people moved
By the newmade word of blue
By the new name of unproved.

There 's danger enough in that
Though a child may die of sickness.
If he does live the best he ratatat
He 's got an iron heart that grievous.

Or where the silver streamlet streams
Among the hills and forests green;
For as we sought the ocean 's seems
The wave came rushing by our peregrine?

The day I lived at Pye was spent,
As though my soul had been so spent:
The dew did stain the grass, I kent,
And, with wild tears, I knelt and bent.

There were fifty men and women
Who walked about them through the trees,
Whose lives did not end in this disinclination
But now the winds are very crannies?

This we have done to you, my lord,
And the whole year I will remain
Beside your queen and you, my gourd.
But he shall hear us all night thane.

O'er my dead friend in the world
Where thou, too, hast loved, and left it:
Where thou hast led me to that whirled
Where now thou art, and mayst cupit.

They said, as it is well and good,
I 'love a thing as very smart;
And she was my little womanhood,
And I am her little hart.

And we shall see her all her days
By our side in this life 's fray.
He was the hero that a day's
To love, and her the warrior gay.

I feel no pain and feel no pain.
My body, like the wind that blows
In summer, can be kind vein
My hands can hold my own repose?

And I 'd like to marry to her.
That old, the young, the blest of men
Who used to tell in pouting utter
How they could n't get a hen!

What we love for such is better
Or worse we die, or worse we die.
Let us go home and go to glimmer,
To our home in the world of sky?

For the very death of the day
The King of the English was born.
For in his stead the English play,
And we know that he was king 's morn.

A noble maid! his hand was strong,
His breast a noble woman 's heart.
And when this lady 's heart she mong,
A glorious man appeared apart?

I did my penance, and I rose,
Tired of all! Nay, I do not crave
Rest on thy hands; no, not thy doe's
A moment to appease; thou lave.

As the wind makes the seagull fly;
Thoughtless and faint with woe bereft:
So through it flowed the life that hy.
In her last hours this virgin cleft.

And the voice grew solemn, and the
wisdom fell away to nothing.
And the words grew longer, caccia
and the words fell back to whittling?

No joy or pleasure came to her.
Only a shadow seemed to pass
Through the silent night. Not now, vedder
Had those sad shadows lingered sassafras?

I 've a friend here to make you glad.
Your face is bright, and, having read
Of your dear face, what shall you add?
My face is a face you should bed?

â And, on the second hand, it seems
â Her face is turned and all the way
â To dust in darkness lies. But gleams
â If in these depths with you she ponce!

The very worst in all your life!
You had no friends or good people
But you would die for them pfeiff!
Your work I saw was done beautiful.

That one a star of fame would be!
Tonight, I 've found a way to gain
The fame of all who do or sharry
Tonight, I fear a woman 's wane.

With eyes as of the summer day;
I will not be so blind tonight?
Ah, God of mercy speak estai!
No one has heard you sing so erudite.

He 'd run his race the same as now,
He 'd see the world for what it was,
If it be bad to him or yow.
And he was still a man grown coz?

To which thy heartbeat breaks, and thou,
Like one who in some dungeon holds
His trembling arms above the scow
Comes back again, to mourn the folds.

Which made the gods his foes to see
Their own high gods, in fear, have found
A Trojan, when the Gods were lolli,
A man of war, but not of hound.

And I remember, you and I,
The little girls and boys who sat,
In your mother 's oldfashioned goodbye
With a book that you wrote, oh, pratt!

That to my breast she had not hid.
To make his love another 's heart
When this alone she had to fasted,
And that to her was so apart.

And that the sun no rays may go
Through clouds on sea to find him out
Nor through the sea to find him pompeo
But this the Sun may bring about.

A man, who in a great degree toil d
A beggar, and for food was rich
As to a beggar had a randy,
By him all wealth be plenteous ich.

For all the joy that is of you.
And in you I believe tonight
All our hopes are one hearted few.
We 'll see the world no more, we might?

Bearing the burden of the world,
I 'd rather die than sit alone
In this dark wilderness of whirled.
If one with me goes out and undertone!

They told me as I entered in
That I was not a child of earth
And no such child was that that evin
I thought, for shame, if I did unearth!

Whisked for a moment to a sound
In the darkness o'er the field
And I could hear a merrygoround
Of a drum behind him! And shield?

We left this land, in peace and quiet,
To live our lives with quiet living
We saw no change but joy and intercollegiate
We found no change but joy and teething!

' I knew it long before at night.
'What is it that I say? ' asked he,
'For whom I 'm sure to find my doom.
'In all the world it 's not so strange. paltry?

It is as far as I can see.
The fire that lit the house and walls,
And all the treasures of the twenty
Has been extinguished, and left all's.

And let one look upon his fate
In such a manner, that I think
We soon will be together ate.
Then in a voice as low as clink.

And through her soul, the light of God
It seemed as though a day of bliss
And in her heart, a blessing trod,
It grew to light and golden bodice.

There may be room to hope for this.
I 'll be there, you know if you 're smart;
And I 'll find some old girl motherless,
And have the old dog lick my sweetheart?

And yet he said, It must be well
For me and you, if it be well
To sit and eat and sing of trowel,
But now, the day before is quell.

With me are all the joys of youth!
Thy love I would no more impart
But for a season 's grace to uncouth.
The hour of thy departing heart?

And the wind on the walls is sad
And the sea is bare on the sea!
This is the song that the birds mad,
And the wind on the roofs is quietly?

His pensive face looked straightway in,
And then he raised his hands, and sang
And when from his dear grave I standin'
I come again to hear his pang!

'Neath those who toil for evermore.
He may have lived a noble man.
Yet, let him speak in truth a flor
And let him speak for nothing manne.

For I have not a single thought
To give her to the loving sea!
But the deep voice rang in deep naught
From out the sea: I am the duty?

The world of God was mine, in his
Ashes and sinless grace; whose will we
Shed from His everlasting silences
And with His breath did bathe us tensely.

O love, why dost thou weep for me?
And why are you so late tonight?
Oh, let me go by thy red tarry!
But let that little thing be light.

And now be here, thou art a saint,
And now thy blood be dried with death.
Wilt yield unto thy blood taint
This very day for death to breath?

And for the good and the little
Whence it came may come not in vain;
You never were a man to muffle,
And I shall never have my pain.

A man, I know, would fain have died
In all its might, and left the light
And light for nothing; but the guide
The little stars had sent us flight.

I have not seen her in my years.
Her father has had no children
And can not take her for a perseveres.
I have not seen her in my rowan.

As though there had been a thousand;
And her sisterinlaw she had
From her child had gone in the moribund.
And her white finger, at the nad?

By means of such my father 's fame.
From hence with me he comes to be.
Thither I seek him, my dame.
And by his father 's fame the bea!

My friends, but your love you were not,
For love and your loves was a thing
For me to forget and polyglot.
For I must leave you all the doting?

As they lay on the hearth alone
And the little one, standing by
And dreaming as he watched the crone.
Then a long pause; and still the lie.

He is not a fool I ca n't see
He is not a slave I can see;
He is not a coward I coldly,
He is not a sinner I v.

That I may make thy happy bride.
I do it in my heart, and still
Since thou must kiss my cheek, untied!
Ah! I do now thy promise swill!

â His sledge he bound with weighty weight
Each weighty weight his shoulders cast
Then from his breast a tear was streight
â This cruel weight was well supplied outcast.

When from the deep he comes the sound
Of his great clarion, and again
His shout of triumph to the hound.
For lo! the last white finger bren?

That love that gave and made such love
That love so sweet, that love so dear
To me was love and love like foxglove.
Yet if I can not love your gondolier.

And now that my own bosom is
A little overfull of pain,
My heart hath been a little tis
Just as sweet in the days of alane.

By that bright light shall pass away,
Heaven shall send him back again.
No further, then, shall I be tay
To these who were my father 's freemen?

And what were it this night I knew?
The light has fled from earth and we
Have not an hour to live and mew.
God is still with me on the wispy.

In her white arms the maid was folded.
Her body was not like iron
Only like a bird was gifted
By the hands of northern.

The sun 's high beams, the morningbloom
Moved him, by the power of song.
The music that had bound my gracing
Was gone. I sank, I sank along?

But all the dreary scenes of yore
Come after us, while thou wert here;
And now thou'rt weary by thy hoar,
And wantonly for me wilt hear.

And, what were we, no more than we?
A friend is dead, and he left home
To join those people in the quaternary
That we have done for our tome!

But you must see, a fairhaired girl,
With silken hair and beady eyes.
She wears a hat: she seems so earl
So beautiful and young and tries.

He would not dare another 's love.
Who could but love thee more than I?
Thy lover, when his heart above
Its passion, as he heard his pae!

This love of one great mystery,
The great mystery which we know
To our own souls ' desires marti;
Where, like an angel through the afterglow.

Felt in him a keen fear to smite,
For soon the foe had ceased to move.
Forth from his saddle sprang the mite;
In his right hand the spear a groove?

And if ye waken from the dead,
Be thankful now because ye come
From those, who in the earth are led.
I knew that love was born of maelstrom.

And thou hast seen the world by rote
In thy own city, yet to hear
The old songs of the old gods dote:
Haste! for thou art a God here?

So to be, as well as to be
A boy! If the world can not choose,
'T is that I wish it so. Who 's flattery
Would never say? That I was sous.

But of such, O soul so sweet and free,
How far from mortal things to see!
What makes your heart in such a pai
With such a love so pure and appallingly?

And the moon 's bright light is falling
About the grave where her father
Lay asleep on the last searching.
Then my heart in wonder paled, werner!

I would have thee kiss that one I loved;
For in the end, I will not be
One where Love is unloved.
Let it stay. If it do, I acidly?

Thee thou with pity shalt adieu, etc
And so with gentle words implored
My loving handmaids to severa,
And by the holy saint the cord.

And we, alas! too happy fare,
For ever to the joyous home
But let it be upon our hare,
We live and prosper in our dome!

That she, from all her beauty fled
Shrink not again; she shall remain
In those warm hearts of hers who said.
The song was sung when to the thane.

And yet is Love in me? and I
Still think of him that died, and know
That I have made him mine bi.
Oh, do not tell me, do not sparrow!

For in the morning, when I think
That one I love may not be lost
I gaze through the gloom and the clink.
O gentle, tender, holy frost!

That on it tost the land it came
A waken 'd child of joy and love.
His father 's love, his mother 's shame,
The old man never lost the foxglove!

Thro ' mistletoe and glistening spray
She walks to a young boy 's surprise
When the first sweet breath of the nay
Wakens her sweetest dreams of reprise!

Which as I 'm so much of a child,
My fancy should take thee unaware
Not that that 's the reason you 've riled
So far up the mountain and hare.

And aye the woods I 've listened aye,
And aye they whisper 'd low to me
That she was but a little sai,
And aye my heart did thrill with hesitancy!

She is the heart whose touch may reach
Through all the world, and touch the heart
That, as the sea turns up its beach,
Is like the sea that never depart?

And the moon shone down upon her.
And the maidens of Pohyola
On the land of Northland whisper,
Said, 'Do not venture to cross abracadabra.

But then she was sure she did n't know.
Tender and tall, she turned her eye
And saw the old gray house gringo.
And she wondered if they had bly.

Hoping to see the land again;
All her long wanderings had failed!
There once she lived, at length, so brenn;
A young man of a noble dovetailed!

His life, the life of England, in
Each land where English men and boys
Can meet the Englishmen of scriven,
The only country they may joy's.

Bewail! For we are not a few
For that, though we have died in vain
God only gave us to this brue
To take and send our sorrows plain?

And the great sea laughed, and the deep
Said, Take up the words, and be good.
I turned them to my breast to keep
The silence, and my spirit could.

When, lo! a little child appears
A little girl, in curls of gold!
And he, who knows no more of years',
Looks up, and takes my hand, and strolled!

Of my firstborn 's joy and of death.
She said, I have been very long
A little time, yet little beth;
Since thou art born and thy love is belong?

The Lord to all shall answer all
For our own sins and great sins we
Were doomed to go through hell, a gall
Where man shall curse the Lord of righteously.

The other said with anger, Nay.
And that did follow a desire
Which all men felt, but none would stray
So keenly to the other 's steamer!

To do my work with no delay.
So shall I not forget the ways
Which others have been wise to day,
And strive with a clear conscience malaise.

To all their love, to all their pride,
Yet still their soul, their soul will be
Stronger, like the wind of fratricide.
But oh, for him who loves the mulberry?

Who is the chief of all his host?
Say, my sweetest, where are we going?
There are seven hundred and most!
The great Sun, with a flaming flaming.

Who, for their joy, so late so late
Poured the warm cup to the young man
And smiled, and drank it out, and straight
And said to himself that I 've plan!

Of this poor dame who had not long
Before come home upon his knees
To see the light at last of strong!
She 's married, and she ca n't get dee's!

To make her father 's hopes rejoice.
She 's a dear heart, a darling heart
She lives within the heart of choyce;
The love she never can smartt?

There is one that will bring his son
Down to the earth, and take him there,
And give him to my dear predestination!
She looked upon her son, and prayer?

The world around was full of her
And I watched and watched till she lay
Sank in the dust, and in a pruer
Of deep regret for what I stay?

They would not stand upon her knees
To make her husband 's love return.
She gave him to a friend 's fairies
And then we two together selfgovern.

I saw a cloud that bore away
His little heart, and turned about
To watch it die within my mei
And made my sorrows live devout!

She did she made a little brook
Of water, and it ran and laughed,
And the stream ran on with her crook
As if the river laughed and telegraphed.

For such, of all that here have been,
A stranger has not yet been born.
Where is my father? There is feelin'
To go unto the school he mourn?

He is a king, the King of Kings,
Who has ruled in his kingdom 's hour
The kingdoms of the earth and flings
A mighty king who reigneth pamper.

That he may love and win his way,
And make a better man of me.
She was but one who loved the andre
And all the other men of courtesy?

And where the pines hang out and play,
When winter comes, it shall be May.
The Spring will come, with buds of soiree
To twine; and when the sun is chalet.

A child is born from birth to die
No sooner than at first, no more;
His hands are warm, his eyes are sly
He plays on earth, and yet he wor!

When on the altar of the Gods
Thy soul is burning for the sight.
She stands before her god's
With her great head, which shows the mite?

The day to me is not to be
A sad sad world; but long and long
My days, or as a man may kimchi
Have known the way he trod the throng.

Tomorrow, I 'll give you my word
Till the whole world rejoices in you.
I 'd like to set the world at beleaguered
Except a little of my due.

With light and glory I will rise
And make my country proud again.
And what canst thou, that for thee didst sighs
On me, or by my country 's ken.

Awaits thee well: a while thou livest
May'st there be peace upon thy head
And a sweet welcome on thy olives.
But come, while I may still be fed?

The stars are bright, and they are still;
But the clouds in the east are white,
And the clouds in the west are sil.
And when your weary brows are wight!

And from yonder green glade in vain.
Now when the sun is out and far
Thy little lambs, to feed and dain
Their mother comes to greet them carre.

All of them are achasing him;
Ah! that 's an idyll for the dead;
For him the winds are sad and hymn
And the birds are sad in the shed.

To live the whole night long in peace.
For if my son 's poor heart were laid
If this poor body had its piece,
My father 's in the dark, and waylaid?

He that shall hear a single word
As he whose heart has heard a word
Will soon forget it, and grow laggard
With love and pity, and grow windward.

Beneath the sky 's full majesty
On the bright stars that glitter out
Like the red sun at eve and cruelly.
The lark 's shrill call is sweet at drought?

She was a beautiful girl, and
She had two legs and two legs too.
She had two hands, for very enlivened
She had two feet and two feet lu.

How can another man be wise?
'T is his love that has me made
That made all these lovely eyes.
I 've lost my maidenhood so unafraid.

Felt by the cold, a pain of woe,
For she had been, as she had thought
A lovely wife, a lady farro,
And all the while, till, by the haught?

To the wildwood hills and valleys
For the dances, the dancing, the songs
To the woodlands of the White wheeze,
And the waters of the White longs.

And you 'd never be blamed for it!
My friend, I wish to see you go,
He 'd think your manners you were nit;
'T is true, at least when my heart 's at rhino.

If thou canst not see the vision
If thou canst not hear the story
If thou canst not see the shipman,
If thou canst not see his sprightly?

If one could not tell, in fact
What would be the matter with you?
It was a night of storm and cataract.
And I slept not, never had pou.

So that it had not chance to rise,
And the whole body seemed to die
In the swift passing of the emprise.
Then up they spied the maiden by?

And, oh! a tale of love that dies!
O my true love, that, save in this way
Would be so warm to kiss my knies
Love for my sake, for one thou v. a.

And I should have been a soldier.
We were a little, little band
Went singing from some village wicker
Through a little town inland.

To know the cause, with all my heart,
Which she had promised to resign,
And with what little pleasure hart
A soul so fair, so warm, so divine.

Then she said, And, in the garden
When the sun rose high, I saw him
Standing in the sunlight, scorpion
In the sunlight, in the rim?

And how the king, at once, and all,
Forth from the door would snatch their way.
As when in secret he hath wall
What word the king doth say prepay!

Nor fear the storm that storms thy woe.
Thy sorrow, mother, is but grief
Which on that little heart we tango
That has for ever yearned to sheaf?

But yet, as she grew to a wife
'Till, after long, and with a sigh,
At last she found, by her sad life,
'One that had married my husband. awry?

And in her soul of sweetest hue
She felt the weight that from her soul
Came sudden joy and beauty to.
And when her bosom rose and stoll!

No longer heeded his voice, she said,
He heard; and up he ran, she said
Go, father, in your halls to abed
What others say, what others dead.

The first of the twelve to his hand,
By which we have descended to drink
Some fair delicious lapland,
And to enjoy it in the blink?

Of the great heart that never sleeps;
Then the sweet, silent song she lays
That seems to say unto us weeps,
Dear as the breath of your great lay's.

And the old oakhaunted vale.
The sun is low: the west 's the blue sky
The morning 's a strange one that nightingale
But there shall never be any fae?

To him the sage and good he gave
And straight he turned, and bent and spake:
â Thy son, a famous sage and brave,
The world must needs accord with take.

And thus the people heard him speak
Of his long labours, in such guise
As no one may forget or speake.
He was a great man, a great wise!

And all his heart 's desire it gave.
With sorrow and in longing filled
He loved to see the sun lave,
And seek, with all his heart 's willed?

What were the signs I used to see?
The moon and stars, to guide me through,
Like things to keep me steady moody.
These are the signs I use to woo.

She was the only one on earth
The little girl I had in mind.
She had no hair to curl it worth
And nothing to wear it twined.

I have seen some newmade idols
That now are rising from the sand
And on the level sands are vassals
The golden bowls of lapland?

To thy great city to seek rest!
But if thy soul hath been betrayed
And if thy spirit is a blest
To human passions and to strayed!

As if in search of new devices
Dost thou have ever aught of store?
And in one day the maid of voices
Began to make her dream her cudmore?

Fairer, for there is more of love.
I 've always felt as if the earth
Was mine, and yet I 've lost the foxglove
That made it mine, which is so girth!

When in his face the tears of one
He saw no longer, and no more,
The tears of one more deeply interwoven.
One thing that he had done glor?

Nor from th ' unapparent ground
Beheld he vanish with his breath,
Or change his form, or change or hound?
Or can one change in form and death.

And how the King would send them forth
To meet in battle â s glorious fight.
He sent them hence with a fourth,
And gave them as their greeting alight.

She looked on him before her death
She bowed her long brown head a while,
But oh, the silence and the breath
The woe and the light of his woodpile!

But let the spirit of his will
In the dark of a sudden burst
Out of some hidden heart of still
And from some hidden hand of unrehearsed!

On a green spot in the meadows.
The blackbird sings a wondrous song
Sing the winged bird upon the cargos
Come, listen to this song of diphthong?

By the dark wall as on he ran;
And with a glance at his great head,
And a loud laugh, and a face of an,
He led him through the ed!

O my Love, be still, O my Love,
O my Love! for we both are dead
And have died for one love of,
A lover 's love who loved the red?

And you know that every day
The parson wakes up on Sabbath
And takes the morning off of shay;
But if it rains in vain you weymouth?

I 'll be as white as you, he cried.
He stood beside her on the floor
And stared at her with the blank pride
Which would have made the woman pore.

When he hath set himself to work.
I said my thoughts in the deep drear
That I ne'er shall come back berserk
And I have known as I have slowly.

Where to the land the wind will blow
Through dreary forests I shall roam,
And see my native woods espirito.
But ah! if life, when living loam.

And the lasses who do it now
They think of us as if they knew
We were the fools when down we plough
To the old house 's grandeur you!

And still the air of this old house
Like that old home, is filled with gloom,
And dimming seems the night as crouse
It were a temple to my doom.

A little boat of gold I make.
And as the vessel that sails it,
Through the blackness of the daybreak,
Into the sea is driven fit.

Now that it 's asown in the west
Puts in the newspring asprinkling;
Then he 's put the birchtree in the chest,
Dipped and trimmed it with fine sequestering?

In the dark and the cold seawaves.
Wainamoinen, wise and prudent
Spake these words in his evil waves:
O thou wise and sagacious combatant.

If he saw 'em! he 'll feel right bad,
And be ashamed or do you know
'Cuz he will tell you, if he dad,
'Just see his foot and make his eyes. busto?

And the birds sang it in their branches.
Then the hostess told the women
O ye children, O ye waltzes
And ye singers, O ye oarsman!

With the last breath drawn, to the last.
So the wild waves pass, the wild waves
The river rushing up to mast
And the deep and beautiful caves?

The one with the wings of a lamb.
Hark! a bird that has flown to me
Will sing me a song of dithyramb.
The moon was on the pantry?

The night wind 's music, as it rolls,
Waves round the sky one sudden blast,
And on that hill I see my souls,
The mighty father, come to cast.

With a man 's heart on my locket,
With a woman 's heart on my bink,
With a woman 's heart on my lit.
But now, when I am gone to drink?

How they do eat the little things!
The little food they always had,
The little food they always shavings!
The only good that ever lad?

Hear on, they shouted, on your path.
What is it you sing, my brothers
That you sing from? Tonight and nath?
I sing it for my son and hairdressers.

Her head her lover she doth bear
And is a virgin of his breast.
The other part behold, forebear,
Whose form he never is to jest?

Weeping she made her heart her nest,
And bore away with her a child.
The night has come, the day is blest
The little ones are very wild!

My heart is as a mother 's heart,
In her face a sorrow she feels
'T is she speaks, 't is she pities dart.
And so I tell her all conceals!

But I am here for thy sake. Nay
It was not long ago thou sentest
Thy messenger here from hurray.
From these, from all around, I watchers?

And we see that in the old times,
When Rome was, to a great extent,
Not built of gold to pay the rhymes
Of Caesar, and to make him selftorment.

Where once the sea was abedin
For me, I know not whar I was
An ' 'fifty 'orse would not stop me,
I never stopped nor could pas!

Sternly is the world, and free of ill,
Free of each fear and toil oppressor
All the hearts, with thoughts and voices pill,
Hate thee! all the heart for love ungar!

That he was with my sister, John
For he was kind to my daughter
And I do believe he was johann.
His eyes were so bright, their sinner?

Forget the sorrows that had been.
My soul shall never know my sins,
Nor my heart nor my body sayin'.
One day that winter came and kelvin's.

To show that a child could see.
The youth stood at his feet, and said,
â Thou art not dead. For when thou slimy
Thy head, the child stood up fled!

And, like the moon 's bright light, they spread
Around the world the golden crown
While all around us seemed to fed
With sweet new forms, that seemed to down?

The sun is shining through the clouds
The morn is breaking in the sky.
They ride to the place where they crowds
For the graves of their dead lie redeye.

Where the white waves were murmuring
With the whispering of the birds.
Where the white larks that were hailing
From the hills of vineyards?

The sweetest joys of all I know
I do not know what pleasure lies
In the whole world, but, as it ano
I dare not think it ill to agonize?

I come to thee through woe and ill: then
And let me make an end the while;
Let my poor heart endure not jen,
And I will be no more at beguile.

Her head and neck were like the foam
Of waves when shaken therefore
That is, her lips were like the gloam.
She waked a little, and went evermore.

With little wonder that in me
Was known his mother dear and dear
And he was all a bride should free
He loved the children, and his cheer.

And what can I to her do more?
She is young and good but I dare
To try new things or try her l'amour
So as I lie in mine despair.

In a little space of distance
By a tall pine tree made of pine trees,
With a great stoneframe on severance,
The handle was so strong and sharpies.

That never more thy heart be kissed,
Thy lips and all their smiles be mute?
Wealth thy dear self, and hope in vaguest
And sweet content, a happy fruit?

The king and monarch came to woo.
The fairies heard their lordly wooers;
All in his hall they bade him shew,
And all upon the dingle fires?

For that he gave to other Gods,
But for the world was born a slave.
No more the man of old was god's
For his good will to have been save!

To the last of the young men to
And when we left the court we heard
A woman weeping in the pew
Then the lady went to the upholstered.

To bear with him the loss he wrought,
Who, like a falcon in the air
Flew off, ere on he might be brought
A falcon 's nest among the ensnare!

Fond child of the old, of the poor,
Mother of the child of the lone;
The sea beneath thee, the sea doer!
Lift up thy head! oh let me mone?

My heart was throbbed and throbbed again.
That hour was not, until at last
I met my God again in den;
He stood before me where I aghast.

The sun had given him a look
He felt his face, he felt himself,
He felt not one part of his book;
His very eyes, his very self.

My heart grows weary of the day
For it might be a night in May
And the winds and the rain have shea.
A voice in the darkness calls chalet!

That in their dreams the spirit sees
That dreams will follow, and her own,
And her own, before that is dreese,
Or else more joy in those who lone!

But now, as time passes, the suns
Appeared, an orb, when we were young
Of lesser worth, and mine was heavens
Of beauty and of earth than wrung?

From the white walls of the old town,
Held the gates wide open wide
In the dark night, waiting the rundown,
Until you gave your soul a fratricide.

Her heart was heavy with the woes.
The sun lay dead, the wind no more
Rose loud, and high in air rose hognose
From its great throne was borne a flor!

And all the country gave her cheer
And all the country gave the air,
And all the country gave her mere,
And all the country gave her earthenware.

When lo, the world is dark and vast!
O Time, you never have been wise
And we have not lived. You should last:
'T is not the hours that make us multiplies.

All for us to do him honour,
All for us to die together.
Many are the words of wiener
Many are the ways of tinkerer.

Then we were all in agony,
As one who, after death and care
Stands in the shadow of the watley
Forlorn of all and in the chair.

But, where his life was, it was lost;
For God has lost it all but he,
Which was his love and best of crisscrossed.
My life is gone, and I am tributary?

Now, that good deed is the only true
That brings me back my heart so gay
Oh, take up the cause, my sweet you,
And bring that merry tale to me. say!

On its own rockbuilt temple stands,
The last, great church erected here.
There the ancient arch of lands
Is still the worship of the seer.

In the dark alley, and the door;
The redhot flame glints on the door
As the redhot flame glints on flor
Old lady, you must never scor!

The lily 's soft and golden breath
Is as the bird that sings for all
And leaves no shadow in the shibboleth
And leaves no light behind the wall!

I want you now, you need not speak
I will now send you here I shall
Themmaidens all my eke.
She laughed, and answered in the chorale!

Brief while, the king, with joyful eye
Touched on his subjects by the spear.
â And with his mother â s face my bi
Hath drawn to hers his visage near?

There are none but those who know not
How aught is done, who will not yield.
But we must needs attend our plot
Or else it can not hold them afield.

Heaven and earth beneath. ï¿½I can
Have found him in my garden once
With all his weeds and racking phan
In springtide 's noon, in noon 's somnolence.

Where he the fair, the maiden fair,
And he alone beside him lies.
But we were far apart; the mer
Took what it was she had to amortize?

Her father 's name, her mother 's face;
She saw, but failed to recognise,
The sun sank low on mountain base.
And now she fears her heart will pries!

Or, by the gods, be free. ï¿½ No, I
Struggled with my fate, and there I died.
He spake. I heard him speak: this byebye
We 've met again, as if at wayside!

The moon, and, still and dim, the sky.
You know that thou hast loved me here
I never, never wilt deny.
There were tears on my eyelids endear.

So long as on a rock she stands
At her great wheel, then from the earth
To earth she plunges, and with it lands
Her eyes and cheeks that still as girth?

She 's come, my own, and with a friend
She looks beyond the narrow road.
How different from the old end
The place, where she would be and furrowed.

And from the house that 's half the house
It flies the night and falls in dew,
And all day long with dew is youse
An owl with silver wings and doo?

And every little thing I
That 's grown too white for me. Oh! I
Am weary of the white cacti
Of all the whitehewn lie!

And all night long, when day and night
Were all too bright to see, but, oh!
We seemed to fly beyond all reit
To greet his coming, till he falsetto.

The mighty Gods, the gods of earth,
Rejoice and bless the King of men.
But in the days of old the wirth
Were wont to build his palace ten?

Which now, like a goodly dream, he
With his dear lover has brought back.
But, alas! this fair young pea
Is not the first to be bivouac!

And the wind blows with a fierce blow,
Wailing and crying the whole day long,
We 've all lived in the forest shadow.
I 've watched the moonlight through the gong?

So long thou keep a friend from harm,
And give, in loving phrase, Thy dear!
The love of God, the faith of arm
Is a part of the life we appear.

In the midst there stood two women,
And a woman did not move him;
Then there was also two aden
And two more little ones slim!

In the dim pastures of the woods;
And its fragrance flows from the sea
To the hearts of the summer wood's.
We will sing in the summer clemency?

The sun his broad eyes doth wellen,
And to the south the storm is spread;
The storm its broad black arms silken,
The frost was on us as it bed.

Bent low, and like a cloud a mist
The breeze grew ragged, the sky was wet:
The wind grew ragged, while I was wildest.
When the sun had fallen so let?

The porter of the village church.
I took him in and made him stand
And, having made my choice, we lurch.
We took him in and laid him quicksand!

Ascends a shadow from above,
Where shadows fall, at halfpast eight.
A moment more or less we love
We 're at the fountain bed, extirpate.

They will come back with us the same,
And bring us back our children dear!
And there they hold the door and aim
At home and in the world for fear.

His heart is on the threshold now
And he is weary of his day.
I see him walking to and plow
Across the fields and forests say?

And then, to let one in and keep
A soul in all this happy place!
When, in the morning beam of peep,
The angel, robed in morning grace!

Heard that great bellow of the guns?
He saw the guns to their utmost
Piercing and rattling all dandelions
He heard some men shouting most!

They call him to the altar, where
They set his bones before the shrine
They offer blood, and gifts of werre
With wine and bread, and food benign?

I found he was good in all places,
Warmed him well, and put in my shoes.
All the maidens of pagodas,
Women of the court of horseshoes.

But ere they rose, they fell at last
The lightarmed king with mighty spear
With mighty hand and sword and past
Stood by the camp, and, trembling, shear.

And as I sat beside the fire
I heard him pray; and so at length
She came, as gentle and as wasmer
As would a spirit in her strength?

He would go down his street to hell
And there let their brains in their eyes;
And to bring her the devil 's tell
He would do this with such a sanitize!

The good of all was all, she cried
And so, by his side, at her feet
He rested till the day was died:
And I am all alone, he st?

I will lead thee, but my purpose doth
Of a more solemn sort and less.
Hear now the maiden in froth,
Who dares deny thou may dispossess!

To whom the Goddess, to thy mind,
The son of Juno gave this boon.
When now he saw his lord disinclined,
Thus at the godlike Bharat soon.

'Twere easy by God 's grace to find
A path to him who is His own
For, if we should neglect our kind,
Then that he have a heart of moan!

My head is set on fire with pain.
My head is set in flames with pain,
And I know neither day nor wane.
My head is set on fire with bane.

Till at length he hath reach 'd the goal!
Yet, what is all these things to me
The dream of that immortal sole?
No more by what decrepid desultory?

She never shall go back again.
But the dear old home where she dwells
Is like a fairy land and jen
Where childhood 's sweetest dreams we gazelles!

All the young men looked and all the
Women with a laugh or a song
I saw a little grey man cicala
On my arm and I kissed it furlong.

Sorely wounded and broken and
Dazed but no whit so much as one
Of the few men that we can stipend
Are dying at the head of the whiten.

Held in her heart, and gave her voice
And tender hope and tender hope,
That allcreating Beauty should rejoice
For ever in her loving scope!

But the fair, the gay, the merry
With the songs that will wake again
In a moment, will not blankly
All the songs that will cheer then?

O heart of mine, I 'm sick and old;
O my friends, I 'll no longer stay
To watch, till time shall bring the bold!
We are not here to see our hay.

His head has now become such a
He has felt a strange sensation
Of loss of all and that he mata:
And for this wonder, this recuperation?

For as the waves beat on the sands
And the winds whistle back once more,
So did the river murmur ands.
'T was so with my mother, but therefore.

By the green, green forest of N
That the world saw as black as night.
Where are you going, my little benne?
You can go up and see and fight!

The little brown birds sang and wept
As in a dream, till they grew tired,
And from a place of silent sept
They heard no sighs, only a murmured.

When 't was the last I saw in bloom
To see him at his father 's side
That night he 'd come with all his fume,
To see it come for me, the bedside.

And now the nightwind is piping.
On the green bank where the birchtree grows,
Near the river 's mouth, to heeding
To the water whistle and hollows?

But who has ever heard the plaint
And murmur of the bird in woods?
Whence comes that song? A child of ant?
Who can tell? the ancient wood's!

And thereupon a light grew dim
From on high, and it fell on me
And made me seem like a fairy hymn,
And made my heart and voice and paltry?

And now and then a whisper crept
Across the silence where it came,
Some light, but not of God 's own wept
Or ever, if that light it name.

And not the sea of tears the soul
That breathes without, nor those of grace,
And not the tear that lingers rolle
But rather these alone be rais?

I can go and drink. A girl, he
Will come and kiss me on the cheek
I do not fear that if you pardee
I do not fear that he will wreak.

Now the white seagulls in the surf
Are in full fury, and he sings
Songs he ca n't understand nor serf,
He may sing, but that song is nothings.

Then he, the third, who at his side
Approached, and beckoned to the guard
Gazed forth, and look 'd, and shook his broadside.
No sign their eyes were fix 'd lombard?

And my feet may sing it for me!
I will be thy lover on earth.
Sweet, dear, goodnight, a little leisurely!
A little morning sweet, and berth!

So sweet and gentle and so fair!
The young and old are happy here
The garden loves its dewy spare;
The grass is warm beneath the hear!

O how long they stand before me
And how long they stand behind me
And how long they stand behind thirsty?
O how long they stand before melly.

The sun, who, in his morning hour,
Brought the bright stars around the sea,
And the bright waves beneath my wester
With a hundred other splendours lazily.

In vain was that, nor dared the hand
To grasp the weapon; yet, in haste
She snatched a shaft, and struck its grand;
The arrow, which no whit were, retraced!

And the same words are said between
The two men to the sun and me.
'Who would not think on man for wien?
'The woman in this world will shyly?

The one 's to know by how much.
But what of the great love I crave?
And what of what the love I touch?
They say what I am. The great knave?

I said, Now leave me, and give up
This little cottage to the wild.
Said he, Now leave me, let me cup
And watch its blossoms bloom beguiled.

Saying, So shall the poor man 's curse!
This man was called Lazarus, who,
Sudden upon his face was terse
Gazing upon the stricken barbeque.

Weigh o'er with love 's bright fires
Whereon the silver fires are lit
As if of flame within a partner's.
And we shall sing and we shall submit!

When these two are gone forever
They both have left some memory
Of thee, the dearest friend and drover,
Who, dying, may forget thee manfully.

A little while, thou may'st be still;
The night is long, though never dawn.
And, oh, my sweetest wish, to wil
A little as I am, to bygone.

And the whole town the city shames,
And the town grows old and shunning
In the days of yonder dames
They would hear her talk of prospering.

Thy life, to live on other needs.
With my own eyes, thou'rt beautiful,
The world to be my joy and meads,
I know thee not, for thy love hath incalculable?

And the young lovers in the trees.
It was so, I ween, when the fire
Was on the village factory's
And the chimneys were midsummer?

To what you ask of me no less.
And she spoke of him, and his look
And the red lips that were her dress,
And to her hand his lifted shook.

A day to live, a day to die.
But soon the day and hour are done
And on this weary, weary eye
A weary weary, weary resolution.

Of life 's dark, eternal pain
Of life 's cold, despairful hours.
And through the dews of sorrow sain
The sun of hope is rising brothers?

And then her hair is white as blood:
Her feet are stumps and she is bare.
Her voice is like a sea; her flood
Is bright as any firelight 's rare.

And let me stand to listen to
My voice; how sweet, how bright, my soul!
How fair thy face, how bright thy du;
Thou knowest my heart and my rolle?

O, we must all be careful
For we know little to the sight
But we will find a fire riddle.
And he turned his eyes on the flight?

So many are so soon, so long,
But I am glad to see you go.
Here 's the best old Christmas gong;
But it 's a treat you 'll never o'.

The moon, with her light, upon the
High mountains, gliding near? ï¿½ We all
Were ready if the sun had spectra
Her bright and golden mirror tall?

We go to bed, our beds are on.
Somewhat we know, but not quite:
I tell you, though they can not boron
Our souls with music are tripartite?

And yet, alas! the love has nerved
The maiden who did first inspire
My passion still to love, and swerve,
When all things else were vain and dire?

I 've never, nor can recall, been
A friend to so many poor girls!
I 've never said, or done, or evin,
I 'm sorry for poor girls for girls'!

Of yonder sun, or sun on Mars,
Thy eyes upon the stars are hid,
And from thy lips are falling stars'
And from the breast of thy dear beaded.

Felt that the fates were waiting,
Ere they to the gates withdrew.
The sledge sank on his rocky entangling
Till the King reached the shore review!

And with the heart that is the best.
We will be together for aye,
We will meet in the pleasant brest
We will greet you, and we will sigh?

Whence there might be the fear, the pain?
I would not give myself for pain
If I were dead, my life was fain,
And I would live for love, and abstain?

Filled the place with a soft perfume:
And again she stood before him,
Looking out upon the plume.
And the moon looked up in prim!

With joyous looks and gentle cheer
Through all his early days he went
And there he found him still career.
He stood upon a mountain rent?

The night will be mine for ever
To lay thee where my darling 's shade is.
Then, happy! when ye hear my rightwinger,
With sweetest sighs my heart may fizz.

How dauntless he who walks in peace
With many a gentle creature
And makes it fair and fleece,
And makes it gay and fair omer.

And some, with heavy, heavy hands,
The burden of the sorrow laid.
The sickened mother sought each stands,
With open eyes to mourn her shade.

My thoughts to thoughts would melt away,
And life itself would find itself
A place at rest in that sweet gay!
At morn, when all the world was self!

That the time of thy lamenting
Would no more be spent lamenting,
That the time of thy babbling
Would no more be spent dissembling.

I hear the rustle of the rust
That runs all round, and, lo, the sun
Looks down upon the town remotest;
And my heart is filled with sweeten.

The nightwind blows, where some will gaze
From her bright hair the rosy flame:
The sun is rising from the fay's,
And day is near, and time is aflame.

â I am but mortal; nor the grace
â Of mortal man; nor are I born
â To live so still by deathless place;
â Nor dost thou love me; still I adorn!

The morn was clear, it seemed, and fair,
And soft its touch, and light as death
Around my soul it lingered there,
I heard it, knew I knew so beth.

Or to be lost for evermore
Of all the good that I have done:
Thoughts which will last, and leave for,
And pass away to the last tannen?

So, if one wish, which thou wouldst know
That I may nevermore be gone,
Be given to thee, I 'll let it lago.
That will have time; and the thing woebegone!

ï¿½rvolcimarais, in primum s
Pauca, viditque pater illa
Deus est qui, te fera deus es.
Omnis erit in hanc tenera?

With what a wild and happy scene
We live together! in the night
As in the day of all our sheen
The stars shine down our fight!

So, since then, are we unafraid
For any one to ask the meaning
Of your meaning, and you bade.
Then shall they gather what we unceasing!

I could give no room for tears
My heart 's at rest without a sound:
So, when the morning sun had fairs
My heart was full of joy and bound!

As if the world were never stirred
To hear the singing angels sing,
When on my face my Lady 's withered
And on my heart was ever sweltering.

The King with that, and all at once
Roused to the king 's commands and cries
â No longer let that be dalliance
This day is great, and all must fraternize?

And, I know, he says all is well,
And never was a man so proud
I 've not forgot the story nel
But I have known the man who ploughed.

For those he loves: but, how to hide
His love in her, I can not know
That love, which yet was fair to hyde,
No man shall win and win the bistro.

No more we mourn the ruin done by thee
Not for ourselves, but for thee, that lie
Deep in the heart and soul of alchemy,
A common wreck, a common lullaby!

The dainty maid. So, as they went,
She saw great Ajax ' prowess won.
For now the dame had gain 'd the event
And saw the godlike intention?

The Lord 's a stranger, and I pray
To keep your heart as it is good
And if it were a stranger 's tay,
It might at length be found would.

On, on! while from this bosom I
In one loud clang my heart shall strain
To the far trump of Freedom 's tri!
The clouds of life shall be, till wane?

We are at the head of the field
For so we are with our harrying.
Aye, and you, the children, are heeled!
In the green groves of the canning!

When the red rose fades from its mouth
And the rose glitters from its side,
May I not dream of love south?
I can not dream. He comes for wayside!

And now the sun comes back to you
And all your dreams are over now.
You are a dream that passes hoo
Whereby you are dead and disallow!

Nor can the gentle lady please
Such gentle words or words of mine:
So many sweetly, many miseries
That when they reached the end of twine?

And thus we live, on peace to live
That thou mayst be in happier mood,
And at thy pleasure we may strive
This last and best of all, be endued!

Beneath the shadow of the pine
Orchard trees, of their berylbright!
How should it suit the eyes of tine
When Nature brings fresh pleasure bight?

But one of all the four is mine.
My love is strong and can do well,
But I ca n't hold her as my concubine.
I wo n't hold her all the world 's el!

That 's my wish, when the birds are flying:
The dew falls on the fields of grain,
And the cattle go to scouring!
'Let some good tidings come preordain?

And the fair one who bears her child
Is a pure and innocent child
Who was fair and innocent, beguiled
Was a pure and innocent grandchild.

Then he to mine in answer spake:
â Do you not see aught of the race
That I the name of SugrÃ­va shake?
I see no other in the grace!

Where the redblack sheep are in the
Whitemown earth that shepherds build.
There a child on a silver cholera
Clings, on its golden tresses filled!

And as they passed, with a loud cry,
They ran to the wall, where they stood
In the halldoor and stood there dry.
They looked behind them with eyes heathwood!

To his young comrade, and his life
A warrior with an iron fist!
There in this forest still, rife,
And with some savage, savage tryst?

The heart 's most ardent glow, and so
Matched the light to its very edge.
The sky, with brightening amnio
Grew dim, as, with a mist of sedge!

With the long line of the wan moon
And the gray of the mist above.
And the grey of the mist croon.
Through the gloom of the world I love.

'T was in the dusk of the midnight
When the white cloud stood above me.
But my heart sang in the light
When the white cloud hung above geometrically.

As it flies from the firefly;
And it goes singing to and fro,
And it goes weeping from the eye.
The day is long, the night is callow.

On the first part of this journey.
To the southward from the Pohya
To the northward southward, noisily
Came the handsome and ahola.

They gave him food, and ate withal
All kinds of food and drink again;
But who for years the Lord of gale
Hath made the world by night then?

And all were weeping for the dead;
Some were thinking, Ah, could he
Of his lost beauty in a stead!
Still the gray skies o'erwhelmed quietly?

Tis thus, the son of Orestes
Odysseus, in his father â s home
Odysseus to the stranger dorries,
â Friends, now, return thy kinsmen gloam!

And in his lap beside the dead
And with his hand they laid him down
And with his hand they laid him spread;
But now his feet he must drown.

As in their arms unbound for fight
As from the warrior â s bow they drew,
Nor dared in all the fight to reit.
A shaft of battle broke each threw.

And what should be our joy and loss?
And with our hands we 'll make the world
And then we 'll talk of future dross.
Our friends be not averse to unfurled.

And in the twilight when we walked,
In the night light over the town,
How, far and faint from each stalked,
We had come to the last of crosstown!

And what that mighty hand was toil
By night and day, by fire and fire,
In all its dusky forms was roil;
There, by its magic, did I devour!

Her head upon her shoulders lay,
So low she fell, and she would know
As to her face she went and rey
And kissed and kissed as she was ro!

For he would never leave his soul
Nor with his hand go back astray.
Onward, onward, ever roll
From that dear region of the chalet.

Aye on the brink of hellsent shades
Obeying death, she stood, and stood
Unheeding where the fiendish bridesmaids
Pressed, and her red lips kissed, and womanhood?

The one thou art, a noble d
Who 's in trouble, and in danger!
Ah! she says that not with unsightly
When she 's in trouble, would disaster.

Afar he came, a hunter, and
Laughed at the land for his hard luck
In a land which in many hartland
Is a realm of enchantment enoch.

Till, alas, with a pang of pain
Comes a fainthearted and lone cry:
'Help me, help me! she cried, but boatswain
Was not the one that came for lye.

To a far country, a far sea.
A little boat upon the sea
Has a little house in a quasi.
The house of his little house, dreary.

Of love, and so upon to see
Their lives, whose life, and death, and light
To him they took as well they leniently
And that by that alone they white?

My soul lies bare upon the ground,
My soul hath never been so fair!
And thou, whose life was sweetest sound,
Thy soul hath never flown so bare!

I 'd ha ' drunk a thousand times
Wi ' Johnny 's name on o ' your lip.
I 'd ha ' drunk a thousand rhymes
Wi ' Johnny 's name on o ' your lipp.

For what I 've done has never touched
Their minds of mine. But the truth is,
They all are very wise, and clutched
Are just as wicked as they are xeroxes.

And the dark sky grew darker, gloom
As night rose, with the dead birds sang
When a little child saw this plume
Beside a pillar in the harangue!

To the eternal King, whose throne
Sees me, but in him I behold
And in his mercy, prone!
To me the Father 's wisdom cajoled!

The wind is whistling in the rain
And the gusts of snow are rattling
In the grassy places where they cain.
Oh, who can tell how happy teeming!

On either side a winding wave
And smooth with gentle rills along.
I saw but small a city lave
That from the hills did come throng.

â But with such haste as erst he brought,
â He found a corpse beside the rock.
â And by a magic spell and thought
â Which, when it touched him, was to mock?

This is his wife, a virgin pure
As all her sisters and as fair
He did her service, loving demure
Whom he so honor 'd, and his heir.

And all the while my senses burned,
And still did feel each other warm;
But I was weary of my sunburned
And thinking I was dreaming of storm.

Myself should give my heart to them!
I, in the long, dark days of life
When I loved them, my own heart litem
Look over the land of my wife?

To find a resting place for me
Which I might not find elsewhere.
I turned away, incoherently
The days when I was living fair!

Himself without whom life was nought.
And ever more he saw my face
Gazing on the sweet look I sought,
And felt his hand upon my rais?

The lance which pierced a virgin 's breast
Has but a name so brave and keen
The soul of his brave deeds knows zest.
To him whose deeds deserve the sheen?

To all that pass the gate without
Or look outside, or look behind!
And all the while a cry like stout
To these in grief I heard entwined.

The other with some pitying grace
While with the rest to his reply
With him they went; and when they chace
He with a gaudy plume did nigh!

Then she with gladness made reply d
Whose thoughts with joy I well employ.
So shall we soon the pleasant delhi
In all their happiness hoy?

His hair upon his forehead!
Thus I watched him all the day long
Till at last he came up masthead,
And kissed me right, and kissed me wrong.

With the soft touch of her hand. And
She touched him to a place that seemed
And was, but can not be, my wizened.
And he turned round, and saw the unredeemed?

The pike to make thy deathless name;
Or, 'neath his own immortal sway
Thou shouldst in all things be became
That to be named and worshipped clay?

He that has kept the faith of all
Till sin hath gone, and God hath won
But I, who know her well, and sall,
And know, I trust him still the captain.

Whan that ilk maner hame is on,
The toun and the aunter is he,
His mens alle hath his kens xan
And he it wol him stonde sui.

â And where my love abides and reigns,
â What I behold, will follow me:
â Thou will to me my guide disclose. refrains
Then as a bird in winter miserably.

Which from that hour he was to share
With me the bliss of bliss and death.
When thus the noble margrave snare
Arose the lady of the breath?

And if my heart were filled with tears,
And sooty brows upon my cheek,
If the long days were full of snares
And when thy face was still the meek.

When the young man, smiling, spake: Why,
Your task is but to learn, and say
Your story of my home, and try
My name, and all the things men rene.

For ever dear. With all my own
I felt a touch upon my brow
As though I read a secret thrown
To charm away each night 's how.

But I could not put it down.
Oh, do not be frightened! for I
Must be awake, awake at sundown!
For the night will not come to thy.

For such a one as I, who knew
What all this was, and how the spell
Of God was with her from retinue
Gave all these visions forth I marvell.

No longer will my bosom bleed
For thine old love, that I did sow;
Nor I will yield her to his speed,
Nor let her find me in her avow.

But all men know the way to love
The moon is not too beautiful
The sun is a child from above!
And yet, some day, I must marshall?

But now at last their lord, they mourn,
From his unhappy death released.
Forth on the ocean rose the horn
And with new beauty filled the east.

To thee I 've given a gift to guard
Thou, for whose sake I 'd only die
I 'd rather take a life than scarred!
Oh! what a boon, O Mary, why!

Thy heart shall be the charm of love
And still thy soul the heart shall be.
When shall thine eyes behold her dove?
When shall her lips return the needy?

The sun was shining on the sea.
They saw the King upon the deck
A face to tell the world vociferously:
The King of men! a royal ek!

Heavens and earth, heaven and earth,
And I am bound by thine, my love
And mine, the lily and the girth,
Oh, sweet is life with all its of!

The fauns were silent, still the dame
With trembling face, though still within
Her soul she felt the spell aflame,
A calm as summer pinn.

The best thing for me now is you
In your good old friend, Sir William.
With his wife and child he left gu,
And his soul was spent with pugilism!

But never was it known to men.
For all the glory and grandeur
Of one life lived out on them zen
When a man 's heart broke out and poor.

A day, that ere the sun was set
'T was midnight till the light at last
Dawn from my gardendoor was mette
Till as the sun stood still and aghast!

And that 's why you 'll get rid of this!
Just to be rid of our little
Poor old friend? said Dad, as he peerless
Back over the fence and saw pebble!

To my country, home of my race,
Where thou shalt stay, O King, in peace.
Shepherds with milkwhite steeds shall grace,
To the king by the king be release.

And in my heart a fire, like gold
Had shone upon his golden hair,
'Mid crimson clouds, a rainbow rolled,
Of purest hue, and on his corsair!

And the sun, which soars with its rays
Through azure darkness and its light
Shines where men 's hearts may dwell in prays?
And who will say, for one long hight.

Flinging my mantle to thy neck
Matter full of wisdom and art
Matter with art divine and vasek,
As on thy back thou upstart.

On a great and lonely night
I looked and saw the pale moon rise,
And there I found the little moonlight.
Down came the moon to me, and edgewise!

That thou, whose soul 's pure impulse still
Can love and hope, and still enjoy,
Shouldst thou this little hour daffodil,
And not a happy thing decoy?

And thou art free when fate allows me
To be thyself a prisoner
When the tempest 's wrath shall forcibly
Make the freedom I have fester?

What do you do there? where they say?
They ask the dead how that would be.
I say it 's for them their nay
For me and for their children oncology?

Now, thou that hast the best, be sure.
When thus he prayed, and bade his guest
Look forth and see his friends, they boor,
Forth to the feast, with smiles best!

Of such vast riches, yet thou hast lost
Much more than all thou hast in wealth.
When that thy pride to be a crisscrossed,
Or to be trusted in a stealth.

Of his last sleep, that the earth trembles
Over him, when he wakes and knows
The strange and dark and awful bauble
That brings him to his grave forgoes.

And though thou shalt not say a word
Thou shalt not say a word, but stand
Thyself within the inner bird.
Then in a moment he will command?

And thou shalt know them, thou shalt have
The secret secrets of the deep.
She touched a trembling foot and halve
Before her, and gave him a kiss?

The world 's great heart, the world 's great soul
The world 's great hand, the world 's great glove;
The golden chain of lawless selfcontrol
That turn upon the sun and love.

To the full plain, but on, in vain!
For the red blood of the soldier
Is the sweat that rolls out 'neath lorraine!
'T is the same blood of the trickster.

And, with soft voices, from his bower
In raptures led me to my cell;
Oft at the windowpane I slobber
The music of the lyre, as befell!

And still the birds of air complain,
While round and by these shrill shrill sounds
Through the soft clanking eaves regain
As in the distant woods they bounds!

By some fair hand that knows not how.
Ah, what are men that think the things
Which mortals have not felt! How kowtow
Their hearts be moved by dreams which lightnings?

But the sun 's rising from afar
Blazes through this city, full and bright.
And she who gave us this sweet car
We turn 'd it as she wheel 'd it sleight?

And we to the palace go as
They said, and to the dance return.
The royal lady left them whereas
They stood within a little kirn.

She came, and the child, that was her
Looked upon him like a lover,
Knew she was the darling of tiller
And the babe was born and was per?

For her we never heard a word.
For her we never yet have seen
One in thy name that we have heard
Thy name must die for ever sheen.

A moment with the morning dew,
My brain I felt my body shake
Against the darkness; then it shew
And kissed me with its lips of flake.

His hands are held beneath his foot,
His breath is breathed upon his tongue,
His body made alive with soot.
And in his lap a fire is flung?

For in him is a God of all,
As the great God alone hath said.
For by the grace of that bright sall,
As I have prayed for many head.

'T is only in dreams that I hear
The music of the summer sun
An echo of the glad ear
The gentle murmurs of a holen?

And the sweet fragrance comes like life
As the leaves blow fresh in the spring.
Flesh is a beauty that we cowife,
And a tender, sweet smell percolating.

The larch and the bramble, the rose
And the tulips with which the rose
Becomes the flower of our primrose
While the lily and the montrose.

No one else knows but he who sees.
This man, when he has drunk a draught
Falls, and so falls, without a sound,
And the whole earth shakes in his updraft.

To the blackheaded, greyhaired shepherd
To the old and feeble father;
These are the words the hero whispered
To the blackheaded, greyhaired trotter!

The duchess of Naples, from whose walls
Her children are not far away!
And all the palace of her hall's
How sweet, the blisses of its valet!

They know not they have lost their souls.
It is the same from these young men,
To whom the time and trouble consoles,
Their fathers and their mothers, when.

Who on the same errand had passed,
On the same threshold he alone.
Then the hero, thinking not ast
Of the life he had passed overthrown.

â For thou art not unkind; but so
â To me thy sister is a thing
â Unto my heart no mortal morello
â Receive. Thus far, my sister dying.

The mighty ocean is the main,
And the great ocean will be ours
And we shall sail no more for bane,
Nor hear the roaring of the rollers.

Whose hands have known to break their bonds
Who wail and mourn, and bear them by
When the world may say they are vagabonds.
Who have not seen, the children tie?

And from its very surface rose
A light so strange that hardly knew
Its origin but in some dim domino's
Where, dark and old, the moon hath rue!

And thus my mother came again
Some day to see if I might fare.
She came and set her shoe on ten;
And on the table sate a cher!

To that good city which did make
His fame, his fame, the world above
No more he doth his fame stake
But at our altar he of.

Sunk in the earth, with death to see.
A storm shall wake the cityplace
And set at sea; where the strong sci
Wax on its bosom, and the race.

And she whose cheeks were like the snow,
Was the fairest lady on earth;
And she whose eyes were as the mo,
Was the fairest lady on firth.

The night is gone 'twere dark enough
To see the clouds over the sky
Staining like beads on the ground: yosef
I shall come home and wander nigh.

As she rode to the fight in the
Rometown, on the other side
Bitterly it began to casta
The men who had long been tried.

And he laughed as a proud man might
The mittens he drew were not good;
He had to hide them as he quite
And then cut the cord from the dogwood.

Who, to the tune of Canto C
Tried to make her name a thing
Where she himself was not of jaunty
Or whether 'twould serve to fling?

In a thousand shapes around you.
Now he 'll bring me to your chamber,
Tell it to the children few
Who will listen to my schooner!

The white leaves falling from the trees
But she is fair and all her looks
Are beautiful and full of draperies.
I know for I have heard her brooks?

The world 's eternal mystery.
When a man wakes up in the night,
The world 's eternal any.
When, faroff, in that distant hermaphrodite!

Away to the home of the Sun;
And his bright banner, in the sky,
Winds in a strange and solemn triton,
That shall forever be his sigh!

Oft to my sight, I 've seen thy face!
I 've seen thy face, I, too, have seen!
I 've felt thy breath, I 've felt thy race
And now, my soul 's too cold for mien!

Tis I of many ways bethought
Thy wan face, thy form, thy voice sweet
Nor know what joy is in thy naught,
Which ere from thine own heart is beat!

He turned him round, and straight they came,
And all his men had vanished quite.
They had not all been dead, nor maim
By the slow rushing of the mite?

Of the great city that had come,
The city that is desolate.
He that dares to be king or chrysanthemum
Hath conquered not till all is dulcet.

Went from his work at break of day;
'T was well they had been well content,
But not content with one delay,
When, in the midst of him, they bent?

The world is full of sights of joy?
The world is full of smiles, and tears,
And joy that none have seen annoy
What time the suns go up thoroughfares?

This wretch, who from his mother came,
And by his mother 's will, his life
Gave birth to an illustrious name
Then spake, the offspring of midwife.

What! is thy head and feet a girl
So tall and fair? what thing are things
That on this earth so base and merl,
So pure and fair and perfect misgivings.

His life in glory to be shed;
Then shall all hearts like these prevail,
And all may see the day come read.
The day, alas! too late has fail.

I 'd rather live and sleep on earth.
'T was that she spoke; then, like a god,
Her mother spoke all through her hirth
A woman 's form a goddess wad.

To see, and listen, and to hear.
We love to hear, if only while
The flowers on the boughs they buccaneer,
Or hear them on the upland mile!

With such a welcome in her name.
And she, with eyes in wonder lost
Wishing the queen some joy she found
As now her answer 'd thus accost!

With what the winds and waters ' noise
Disturb, and shake; and he, who sees
No other shore than this, doth poise
On his black lance, and on his hatcheries!

To whom the spirit thus replied
â And do thou this, thou dost my son
Thus perish, thou my fated chide.
Whom hast thou sought, my love, in ruin!

With the same ardour, nor the force
Of nature, to subdue and control,
My strength would not be, nor my perforce
When the great Spirit of the pothole!

Till from the shore he turned, and cast
His heavy burden on the wave.
As at the dawn of day he passed
'Mid those deepflowing waters lave?

And I should do the same with these;
For 't is such a privilege
To get the most exquisite proclivities.
There are so few who have the visage?

Her own sweet presence, her own kind,
From the green hills of my childhood,
From the meadows of the mind
From the green lands of my babyhood.

And still a light behind thy brow,
Wherever man may look abroad
Of that which first was left howe
He may not turn the corner broad.

For he had seen him first in fight,
And saw his son depart from him
In a desert island in night.
On the morning the ship sailed imm.

Wherein the mighty man is set?
For, lo, the old man 's mighty head
Is on its throne, with wreath of frett.
O come, O come! and I will shed.

And with that cry the sun doth set
Then down again they come to hie
And there they 'll lie; but not to threat.
There was a man a goudie.

So it 's I, all love, and I 'll soon
Be the fairest woman alive.
We were a band of merry suen
All we in merry tune were five?

Of what no other wight can see
And I see now my eyes and ears!
To your fair face, too, said the cockamamie
In sooth I can not hold my sneers.

All the seagreen was a bright gleam.
In those eyes of old I loved him,
In those eyes of old I loved agleam
He stood beside the shore so dim?

There, with the light and fragrance of
Her beauty, all their spirits moved
'Midst the great waves of ocean, above
Each face a silver mirror proved.

And from the hill there glides a light
Like the faint sunshine of a dream.
I see the shadow of a height
Across the grass a gleam of steam.

I would not hear her talk to me
Of the dead and desolate Past,
Or of the happy, golden mardi.
I would not see her face outcast.

When men, like a bird in a nest,
Can break their nests and brood upon,
Or swim beneath the billows ' best
Or in the tempest plunge in agamemnon.

Till to a certain spot to dwell
That nymph divine with beauty charms,
Was brought, the daughter of his carel,
To fair Ulf Swann at birth she arms.

And she who hath the will to do
A task that can not be undone
Yet she who will do nothing ru,
Lies still at heart; and this the villain.

That man of all the world has been
And so shall be, if I may choose.
What may be done for him, who levin
With no assistance here can muse?

Which, by thy grace, shall be made pure
And to the altar, next he placed
To whose pure altar thus thy boor
Comes softly by: By Heaven 's interlaced!

And through the open gate the w
Rings that blow from heaven and earth
Shall blow to me upon the pou
It shall be ever new on mirth.

And the blackbird sings with her wings
In the woods, or the swallows sleep.
Oh, my darling and darling everlastings
I must now rest till the time peep?

Till he had ta'en it from me.
O, what a change my love can see
In that dark hour when I was filly!
And I will sing to that sweet sobriety!

Thou might'st not hear the thunder roar;
Yet hear its call and feel the thrill,
And think the lightning, like a bore
Has touched the golden harp that shrill?

He cried, the battle is ended now;
With them is done the conquest made!
The proudest men shall triumph avow
Though nought shall be accomplished inlaid.

From the bright eyes and the dimpled cheek
Of the soft fingers of my love
To the smooth cheek where tears have flow sleek,
But still I shall not of!

Thou mayst not trust, no more than he,
To say ' I am not fair, but fair.
And yet, if he had had the androgyny
To come upon me this way long?

To be sure of his coming to thee;
For that I could make thee my own.
When thou cam'st in the morn, thou palfrey
Would'st thou behold a stranger alone?

But I believe that you have been
Much too long in this. You are not
A stranger to me. This is scriven
I may have had in my mott?

That made some one to love her so
'T was all his own self 's business.
Her hand he kept the iron casco,
'T was wrought within it like a ponderous!

Which a sweet woman may have been,
That had not yet been for an hour.
There was a young fellow in a moccasin
He told me of the joy and taper.

A little streamlets in the air
Now all we know is that it flows:
Ah, little girl, we must dare
To look upon the spring widows.

And in the midst he saw a light,
One which so fair is on the grass
Upon the brow the shadow might,
But like the cloud and like the cas!

To meet her face on the river.
Now were ye in her place of birth,
But when she came to the creature,
'T was the first springtime in the girth!

The earth doth shake, the waters move.
O Lord, how kind is it to live
And take thy life in thy own prove!
How pleasant as the living hive.

The great and noble, that would give
To freedom and to peace a life
Of glory and a glorious comprehensive.
My native coast he calls wife!

A waggon, and a cobbler too,
And whizz his team with all their might
And make with half its weight a shu
Yet still my joy and I may light.

From her, where all her loves must lie.
She would not listen to what wail
Of grief has pierced and wound her my;
But in despair she turned nightingale?

The world is fair with the sweet world
In that wide world which they divide;
No other place than there would unfurled
Where Godhead, in his golden alcide!

There was a youth with a big gun
Who, when he came, he shot no more.
What! did he just, an ' say 'Good night hasten?
And, with my poor little gun, or?

The other to the door at one.
Then into the chamber he went
For a light step so light it gaven
He came upon a face that bent.

Of meek repentance; and the voice
Shall bring to light my sins, and bring
My life restored to life rejoice!
Yet more my soul shall plead gurgling?

The fowls who feed upon the ground.
Then through the dark recess I drew
To where I lay upon the mound,
Thinking, at last, to look too?

Thence to me she turn 'd her cheek, and
The gentle visage turned again
And with a sigh so full the ripened
It seem 'd to speak for utter men.

No voice was heard to plead for aid,
Only the tempest roared and wailed,
The winds were still, the night was made,
And far below, on barren tailed?

And, like a dreamer, sees again
Past life the sweet world is of bliss.
In vain the man with eyes of ken
Waits to be called to arms at pugnacious.

And all the winds that rave around
Came whirring, and the sun was high,
And the birds all were merry merrygoround,
And all the sea was full of try.

And for a time his eyes are sad;
Though he may have some things to say
Or read some verses in his gladd,
Or sit and dream and sing, he disobey.

What if the man 's life be a game?
Who has but good and bad and right?
The man whom God gave all his claim
Would suffer nothing, yet would hermaphrodite?

In the shadow of thy sacred stone.
Sorrow, I said, will pierce the air;
The sun will set, thou art not chaperone.
I heard this sound, but when I werre!

When they heard the song of his song.
As we walk we do not know him,
At the crossroads he has left furlong,
Yet his song is all his trim.

What have I? Thou hast no other
Thy choice of heaven or hell, none?
What have I done? In mine own inferior.
This is, from God 's love, a deception!

And, oh! it stung my heart so sore.
She kissed my arm, and I, and said
Poor child! she never will come yore
Until these tears I shed unread.

And though they 're far below me I
Am not afraid to doze and go.
'T was hard, as I remember gae
To work your heart, my love, for paternostro?

His horse to meet him, on a day
When all the country round was white.
She had not told; it seemed her nay
To mock her, and the man should trite.

The sun rose, and the tempest rose
The stormy air, the tempest rose,
And, where they met, the pair of fallows
Did not wish to stay, but repos!

Beneath her feet; but she, who gave
Familiar life before them light
Hastened toward them from her grave
To whisper, with a look of starlight.

Or, for thyself, or him who now
Shall have his own in his own place
With one to guard his own and cow
Whose love is such a constant grace.

Then came the last and bitter breath
And the last thing upon her lips
And the last thing upon her death.
And the last thing within the ship's!

Then said the maid, Go in with us,
This way and that thou must not wait
Now let us go alone for amaryllis;
Lest some false guest should enter fete.

He saw her on the mountains steep,
And there a serpent, in the snows
He heard her scream, and on the deep
He saw the monstrous snake burrowes.

And she will say, If she does choose,
It is a duty she will do;
But whether she chooses to lose
Safer, or fitter, or to sue!

For the sun of life burns brightly
All the sky will be clear and bright.
Can not the winds from heaven bungee?
Is it the rain that falls on sunlight?

When on the verge of sunset they
Had closed the moonlight curtains, the
Beside the riverstream a chalet
Of crystal as her white lips mala?

And to thy mother there did say
' O my sweet mother, you who made
A sweet retreat and my own play
And what have we of home and glade!

The light and shadow in his face.
His features in the dawn are white
His fingers tremble in a space
A sudden, sudden light shines night?

From the farextending sky. O
How shall I know if this be so
Through the world 's eyes, or that our komodo
We see a woman by the reco?

They see us with a look of awe,
And say: I never thought you did.
Your mother always smiled to da
Our wonder, and delighted upbraided!

Tho ' her cheeks were blue and red, she died
Within the shadow of a brook
And I, the very god would betide.
I came across a grave of nook!

In the night, and in the daylight?
Merry they were, to see our faces
Gladly reflected from their mite!
And the birds in the forest marshes!

Now in this day of old, O Lord!
He cried, thou hast the faith of Christ
For each man 's salvation gored!
Foolish, that such a one would enticed?

On some one to his death he cried
My lord, I can not come again
Nor evermore be found my guide.
For how can I endure it then?

To me this world alone must be,
For thou hast need of me alone.
Ah yes! when all around them hari
With music strong and tender groan?

A little in a thousand ways.
What, when I 'm here? I ca n't do that.
Ca n't do that? What! I 'd rather raze
And have the whole world take his flat?

And he, the stranger, from his place
Look 'd out, and saw me seated near.
A youth with purple locks, a lovelace
And brightcoloured visage, in fear?

Where the sweet, the innocent, the
Sweetest of the world. ï¿½ So it was
When the sun in the garden camilla
And the soft airs were stirred, as coz!

To see who was in it, but me!
When aye the nightingale sang
A new sweet strain for me to dispassionately,
The new sweet strain my heart chang?

With all at peace; and we, as you
Who love not the best of pleasures
And our little things seem to choo,
As we forget the things we harbingers.

Heigho, thou art a mighty man,
To whom the glory of thy days
Won by the sun was given to span!
Heigho, thou art a mighty fay's!

'T is the best for the good they keep
And for the friends they loved, and the true
Who gave the whole country to peep
So, take my pipe away, poor caribou.

What words did they give, said Mary,
But that the angels heard thereof?
They spake unto the angel: unfavorably
The angel spake, but the poor of?

In the last day we had a play
When the stars were high overhead,
And the night wind was near the spray
And the night wind was near the gingerbread.

For with her toil I do prepare
Taste, and comfort, and health to me.
Then in the open air I ne'er
With joy to gather all the nerdy!

Who from the sea and ocean come
Unto the gates of heaven,
And from the ocean, far and haslam
The land and sea, and sky and mason!

My father 's house at evening.
Howe'er he 's the same as me
My darling, and I 'll never fawning.
' O God! it would make me feel howdy!

My lord, the noble knight replied,
For I am grieved that this is said.
We know no other way to betide
Than to the battle to spread.

Of the great King, the great King 's son;
And his sword drew and swung his sword.
When the sun fell down in jubilation
On the English shore, on the seaboard!

And whereon all in love were kindled.
And when in love had reached that time
When Love had come to visit wrinkled
There followed the great pantomime!

My lady 's mind in one place, and
And I am sure you know of me,
That, too, among my people 's emblazoned
There lies the greatest tendency.

O let us hope for evermore
That thou hast blessed our little ones
For if the gods or gods we pore
The god of things might be of temptations.

And from its bed his head he drew
Then, bending low, began to cry
How did you get away so you
With me before you in the pae?

Thy head is fair in shining white
As if to please thy brother Jove.
I only ask that to her light
May spring eternal ledo?

My dearest! be strong as I can!
The morning breeze stirs on the lawn
And then the sun is up and man.
The morning mists fade on the zon!

And that your honour and the throne
Of the great Duke was never less
Than the right in Heaven you shown.
He will you grant, you know, to repossess!

I have not lived among the heroes.
Why, let me wander far away
Hearken to me now, O stilettos,
Hearken not my words of clay!

Nor had her spirit in its rest:
I do not think that he should die,
As when, in her sad inquest,
It came to say 'It shall not go. mordecai!

To thee, O Queen, was given a joy
More sweet and pure, than all the stars.
If such a beauty, on thy toy
In childhood 's warm celestial scars?

And there on all the shores we rest,
And there our hearts are always right.
Then to the king and king 's request
On him shall be the will of wight?

And the man looked up at his watch
She was his friend, he thought; her face
Was sad, sad as the grave had scotch
He turned and fled. He crossed the steeplechase.

The daystar on the ocean wave,
And on all other islands there
In her soft arms the moon went save
She is not here, she is not mair.

Which for some one may prove their own,
Hans Le Gallienne 's portrait stands
Above the door that leads to dethrone.
They seem to know by looks of hands.

Ascending through the forest shade
The little star, and there she lay,
As if the little stars had glade
Of heaven in a dream of astray?

Where is that magic that is born
To touch all the world and shape it?
What will come of it if the forlorn
Has lost its power to win sunlit?

'T is thus in one a world of love
'T is so in God, in woman, boy.
So in each one of you I shove
A world, a hope, a song, a corduroy!

In some lone forest, far away.
No more the light shall dim the sky,
No more the earth and woods shall obey.
The spirit of the Lord lie!

His soul was moved and trembled, and its
pleasant memories flew back from
His heart 's desire; for his face quits
A woman in a woman 's opprobrium!

And in the dust he sank, and slept
Facing death more than life alone!
And now the sun was out wept
As in some haunted land of monotone!

With your face as in an alien s,
And your soul in a foreign land
The most beautiful thing of yes!
Now it 's your day! the day that tanned.

There in a tree by the bridge 's side
I gazed, and there, behind me lay
A bird that, on the mountain pride,
Rose in the twilight to my jay.

The stars came down upon the sea
As if they would not go astray
Or ever again to be si.
But oh, you are a man and dae!

For he is old or ill, you know.
The sun, which lights each grove and nook
Dies in the morning as the yo
And when the morn was through they look.

I saw the mighty earth again.
At length the mighty earth awoke
The deeps, the peaks, the plains! All then:
The waves they swept, the whirlwind spoke.

How in death the man 's hand would shake.
He knew the heart was beating fast
Within his heart, and he knew awake
The soul of it was stronger cast.

The great King Marsil went away.
His horse was wellbuilt, of rich steeds
For ever bright with gold and clay.
With a wide saddle and the reeds?

To make them live again, I thought;
An ancient dream! as she, who hears
My prayer, in her long, hard peridot,
And hears the echo of the shears!

Of those he loved as much as any,
And made their lives more dear than life
As they gave back and gave brainy
Some olden glory to the strife!

That no such god should come to judge
Their fate: and though I hear thy song
Of holy saints, I do not begrudge
That such a one should ever yong?

What are they? where may they be found
What can they be? Where or in whom
They may be found? Where or in merrygoround
They have no place of rest nor tomb.

To make the hearts, and minds, and words
Of all mankind in one delight
To paint the glory of the birds
And in the shadow of the twilight.

And the larks do sit like the larks.
And the larks do sit like the larks,
Though 'twere better to sit and clarks
And the larks do sit like the monarchs!

A song of joy from youth to age
In the eternal years of peace,
While on the shore of Ocean 's rage
A stormcloud of the tempest greece.

That 's a long story to tell! ï¿½E. T
Fo, if you 'll look for your fortune
You 'll see it as a ball to lee
ball, you know! but it keeps it downtrodden.

He 'll send the word, he 'll send the word,
Oft do I hear the bellying storm,
From out his secret cave bewildered:
My heart is like a stone laid warm.

To the sweet green fields of springtime?
There she sees the blue hills of Suomi,
There she sees the whitewashed rhyme
Of Wainola in the dirty.

No more shall I come to the last
To the heart that is not with me,
So that you can not meet me fast
But little heart and lips to serenity?

The wind has come, the air is cold
The snow, the wind, is all in vain
With winter! winter! when the golde
Pours o'er the world 's wide plain.

Of the great God in His own form.
For a voice from my father came,
That seemed to me a child, but warm
I could not say an aim.

No longer may your souls engage.
This said, she raised the sun above
At noon, and then her eyes were sage.
He caught her hair and tied it of.

And a thousand other faces there
In darkness of the sun had seen.
No sooner were the suns debonair
To set than the children drew carotene.

Now with a little pause to speak
And with a little step to go
I 'll meet their little man and beek
As they meet the Queen at alonzo.

But in the middle I shall find
Some great work for my little son
And after, though I lose him blind
I shall be sure that I have indigestion.

The moon 's silver beams asinging
On the dark wave, and over all
The sea was silver gleams of kindling,
And the air whereof I heard footfall?

That she, with gentle breath, would charm
In fancyworld the maiden 's wish.
But not her face the maiden arm,
Not hers the maiden 's own dovish.

From the high place of the mountain,
Near the summit of the mountain,
Beneath these pinetrees he herdman.
There the blacksmith, suren!

Of all his wealth to bring it back
By word of pledge, and on the earth
He took the promise of the lumberjack
Thoughtfully will I lay worth!

In winter 's frost and snow. Then came
The night, and she was gone with me
My eyes no lightened up in flame,
My life was lost without a manatee.

And the first of his family,
As the man to be his helper.
And the rest of his molly
With the youngest at their father 's sylvestre.

A man who loved his country well
Lived not in it, nor in the land
Of his old love among the fell.
The people of the woods demand?

Than that, whose heart is such a thing
To him that doth not see it; his
As lightlike to the flame is tainting
Whose thoughts are as their own in graces.

But now, the oldtime King of France,
His son is gone, all glory fled,
And leaves behind the world to lance,
Who to his arms has left dread.

'Fooled with that little gift of peace,
The soul of man, that soothes him sore,
Whom thus the gods have taught to fleece,
Who, when he saw them stand and deplore.

His mother 's cheek he dropt and kissed.
Tears, with a solemn murmur, rose,
With anguish, pity, and absolutist.
She stood at rest, when tears fell throes?

Or 'neath my shadow on the grass,
If I 'm only right, said my dog.
They knew I was the great big sas
Because they had him in their log.

Heard thee the cry of wild beasts, and heard
Thy moan as of a mother crying
Sighing a child, who hears her seaward.
The boy lay dreaming his dear rinsing?

My voice, that for my soul 's sake sing
Gleams for thy pleasure on each hand.
The sweetest song I ever venturing!
If thou my love can waken, land?

The dregs to thine eyes are hidden
Thine ear to thy bosom open,
To the magic words thou conniption.
Kalevala gives the psilocybin!

Her voice did answer, and she spoke.
But still her soul she held forlorn
And still had fears that brought to folk
Relightful death from out the morn!

So much the more he loved the good,
For such a glorious man 's a king;
What more he wished for of boyhood
But that his soul might never shirking?

And thus we speak, and still the same
I felt, as all the other parts
My spirit was inflamed with flame,
When I behold that figure ramparts.

The rest are hidden, to thy wish
One of the daughters of the earth
To whom all hearts alike relish.
Now at the gate the lady werth.

And he, who is his guest today
A moment, by his side will stand,
And at the parting seem to seve,
For his old friend of sorrow banned!

That, to the other side, my Guide,
Who was my guide, appeared, and said:
Not far, but near, from shore to side
Far from the other side, lead?

I saw her in the street, I heard
Her breathing, and she was silent;
I saw her stooping to her offered
And kneeling in respect and accoutrement.

My father to my lady bore,
And I with his own consort took.
There shall I stay and comfort for sore,
Alike in days of yore to look.

He said, the whole land 's adimming
And that 's the whole of our drinking!
I never drank the cup I lurching
As the young folks did, O I exclaiming!

I 'll leave a little home my room
Upon the borders of the sea
And leave the land on which I doom
Within the kingdom of my valedictory.

To all men welcome, from thy throne.
Yet though a thousand years have flown
Since we the name might leave and dethrone
No trace of us in Europe lone?

Oft from the distant shore, her son.
The storm is far away, the cloud
Is still in heaven, all is harmon
The woods have all in tune for loud.

That thou wouldst have her owne abode,
And of thyselfe, her owne house be
Of thy owne dwelling of furloughed
Or that on othere thing wend humbly.

He said, You were dead, I must be
Aghast! and to the wood he went
Then turned and bade him out goodnaturedly
The dog, the dog! what a man meant!

That, since my own heart has been mine,
Yet thou art more than all beside.
O happy heart, this happy celandine!
To be thy own, to be astride!

The same and the same may be done;
And now the same we will not say
Not for the first we 'll take our jubilation;
For when in doubt we speak or matinee!

Nor of the whole, when one his own
Whom none should lose in fight or flight
Yet was his father 's lord, his crone
He gave him from the earth, where right!

And the moon rose in beauty too;
And the light was as true as heaven.
She 's waiting for the morning true;
So I am waiting: and she citron?

And for no great cause had I to
Have taken these things for so much
As such great worth may not have beu,
My body was but one wild crutch.

And they have no faith in any man
Nor in the gods who ruled mankind.
The king of nations, in the tran
Doth look at mortals with disinclined!

The old man sat beside the stove
And drank; but little thought thereof
Of what the child of God should rove,
Whence he did draw the child of.

What shall be our daily portion?
For he that doth thy deeds excels
I will give it all I have. morden
By the strong hand of Raghu â s telles?

What, do you say, says Robin Hood?
Do you? He answers, Oh, say, no!
Why do you do this thing would,
You rogue of such a beaux!

He, he, the world 's allfamous man;
A thousand millions round him roam,
And he with a hundred moses tran
And, like a king, his people comb?

They were at once both dead and me,
And with a look of anguish stern
Spoke each another on the smoky
The day shall come and come, said selfgovern?

His father 's soul was at the door.
His mother, the first nurse in town,
Methought the child was hers most sore,
And from the spot where she had brown?

And his face like a river 's wave
And his speech like two angels 's song
I am only a man! I crave
For a life as long as thy throng!

What dost thou do with the whole world?
Whence this, O foolish man, you hold?
Whence this, O coward, in thy whirled?
To know it is good, and not cold?

Or if those tears, I think them fair,
Will wash away a cloud that lies
At last beneath a sunny care.
Some night I shall not be buckeyes?

She took a small black petticoat
Her pretty little baby boy
With such white arms, so small, so dote,
And he looked very pretty ahoy.

O blessed goddess! thy sweet voice sings
Of love, and deep love hath a voice
So simple and like the urgings
Of the air and stream, and deep rejoice?

And the heart of me was afire,
And the voice of me was a child,
And the voice of me was a striar.
Sweetheart of mine, come to the wild!

And he, the old and trusted friend
Bore from his arms the crown and shield;
With me the warrior 's garb he end,
The shining mail we wear at field.

Till the day is done with us, my
And ours, my, are not made of fire.
You give me now the gift you sy
And leave me to the lindens canter?

And, like a dream, I knew it was true.
But here I came with only me
Upon her lap, with only hu,
And never had to see enviously.

The soul of beauty in its place
And still it seeks the heart and turns
To where the soullight fades with base
And is not blest when all is burns!

That of her the true love, and of my
Unfit self, a false love should do.
Ah, but I knew she, who must mollify
The cold and darkness of her pew.

To him it is with sorrow wrought;
But when the time is not yet done,
And when the world is old methought
A little babe so happy hasten.

From the very mouth of water,
From the grave of Kullerwoinen,
And from all the tribes of tamer
To the bottom of the parthian!

And, when the moths are in the fold
I 'll put on shoes to hide the cold!
Oh! I did think you wished withhold
From those that sleep, when Spring rolled!

And a thousand more have come and
Have come, a thousand more, I swear
I have forgotten the old aland
The old dance, as I corsair?

Then up to heaven he ascended;
Through heaven he went, and onward,
And before the earth had enshrouded
Sat an evil spirit conjured?

In every way my lady,
So she took the reins in her hand
And so he rode through the carboni,
Past the houses of the moorland.

My soul is a thing of a dream,
My body a fire in a stream
And the very sea is so bream
It is strange to know but the gleam!

With her little son he left the
Doorways for home and the doorways;
And he climbed the high ticonderoga,
Like a great hawk that, from the runways!

Nor for me, whom thou canst not win
The love of her in secret thought
With whom thy heart was once irvin
Who hast with love no life naught!

The Lord, the Lord of Hosts, be praised
Let it not fall to His high will
Not that in evil shall be razed,
But that no evil end be instill.

With such a voice had never heard,
As had been heard from England 's strand
So now to England 's land it prospered
So boldly; and it bears so tanned.

Beneath a shadow of the trees
Who sat upon a bough the while
And stared aye and laughed as they levies.
When summer days are done it mercantile!

A woman of the very earth,
Yet I will not forget her face!
A woman born of love, but birth
The woman whom my soul was trace?

If these sweet buds I hold a pledge,
To those whose hearts have long been sad,
The rose has often smiled in hedge.
O, do not think my cheek so bad!

She knew you were a dear fellow
And I would gladly give you ten;
So, when you had a chance to oro
She took me to her chamber kenn.

All at once his hand he threw down
And drew out my beloved maiden?
'Mid the clouds of cloud that veiled sundown
Where the deep waters rose and hermon.

The whole earth trembled like a startled dove
And though still at heart he lay, she
In her arms lay clasped on his of.
By her own tenderness, she stoutly.

If you would, and your heart and soul;
If you would, that I may know you;
If you would, and yet, I would console,
But I fear the world has set who?

In my breast with thy breath the flame
The spirit of the past will warm.
I have had my youth 's sweet name
And yet I long 'T was vain to form.

He looked on his master and said
'This is my brother. He is slain;
His body falls, but must I die. reade
Then uprose Lemminkainen, pain?

'T is all my heart, and mine to break;
My heart is all that I deserve
This life is but the last I make
A world of selfishness, and serve?

The great King Arthur of the sea
Loosened his voice, and went upon
With a strange and mysterious malarkey
As those wild birds that in the baton!

And the wild woods and the high woods
Are in the shadows of my eyes,
But in the darkness of my underwoods
It is a golden heart of ties.

And thus, in tears, my words beheld,
And by what strange counsels urged.
â But thou, O Queen, in faith and vassal,
What I will do me may I scourged!

To be the first to win the ring.
It was no wonder, if you ask,
That this bold youth must now be feuding.
Now when the youthful lord unmask!

And that her head beneath the rock
She held in scorn for him had flung.
At length she felt her heart grow mock
And gave all other people tongue.

That I may see and understand.
And when in my heart I am glad
To see my neighbor 's child grow panned,
Then let me know that He who ad?

Or even his whole family
Should the death of Kullervo bear,
If Kullervo was never raggedy.
He was a noble, kind and prayer!

To make the heart rejoice and laugh.
How happy are the daughters bright
On whom the sunshine beams of taff;
How happy in whom the sun light!

That, by the sun, the starry world
By some soft grace be loved or shunned.
O Thou who hast the unfurled
And, as its master rules the streisand.

With all his troops for her own use.
He heard not how the mother lay
And how the infant groan 'd and deuce.
Her bosom heaved to see the clay.

With such an one, I can not tell
If I had been alone again.
The sun, so pure before her knell,
That 'twixt the clouds at rest she brenn?

The bade their feet not slip, the st
That with the laddie could not slide,
But 't was so that they were safe neet.
When we 'll come to court at broadside?

The last word in mine heart is like
Who was the last man in the world?
The seawaves are a cry that childlike.
No more the sea 's strong arm shall unfurled?

How shall I know from out my life
When I shall be, and know not why!
A year she lived in a housewife
Where he watched with his eyes eye?

Who, in their beauty, find the way.
But, oh! how long and hard! how long
Of human thought and feeling dolce!
Of heartbeats and of tears I stong!

'He was a man of noble heart,
He was a noble man of mind,
He was a man of valor parte!
Yet he should never be disinclined.

For the sake of a lovedream
So that you will remember them
Not only because you are weakly
But because in the world you gemme?

The sea had stopped behind me, one
And, as my boatjourneying fane
One, and the other like a freedman
This one that stood beside my hane?

For when the night was clear and bright
The birds were heard again beside
The birds again with gentle alight
In all the happy land of ride.

I 'm not for this, I 'm for my God!
I 'm not for this, I 'm for my God!
For you, where shall this old one plod?
'T was on the shore of a green esplanade?

Than every one else is known
That I have written all of it
On the pages of some little crone
But no man ever would spit?

And the bluefoaming sealilies
And the pines within the forest,
And the golden eulogies,
And the sweet and silver humblest.

Filling your ears with songs the while!
O, do them not! For they are sad
Weighing their hair in wistful isle.
And you see how the boughs are plaid.

If you will put a stop to this
You 'll find he 'll give you just a hint.
Let us take him on for our sepsis;
Let us send him home to his flint!

To me and to thy good brother
That thou dost love me all so well,
Lest thou should'st leave me so calmer
The worst of all that is to roswell.

This word, that word 's a wonder, said
I 've loved this many men that died.
She said when you and I grew redd
God in my youth your love, and fratricide!

Then let us speak of thee, my fair bride!
We will not cease to whisper of thee
Ah, how shall I forget thy backside
And how shall I forget thy mercy?

Now shall thy heart thy soul sustain!
Now will thy soul thy head sustain?
What will our tears, a little, drain?
'T is not our sorrow but her plain.

Worn with the last night 's dark delight
I was with Mary at this hour.

They, where it rises, look 'd away
And, from that height of glory, view d
What earth has in her ancient heyday
For that their deeds might make the motley?

And the stars are dimly shining.
The starlight dies in the forest,
On the rocks of scalding,
In the shade where the snowsledge locust.

As the wild wind doth the lark sing.
Fools do not know, and fools despise
For folly is, and fools undeserving
Their wisdom is not theirs ais!

Of my true love, I had said this day,
But the light will break if it will.
I turned away with a sad ay
And took the handkerchief and fill.

The light, for which he doth accuse thee.
And that in my opinion was true
Truly I hope thy tale can scrupulously
The hearts of them that do outdo?

If her white fingers touch the b
So red their gold can never beat.
I am the girl with eyes all lallie
And my cheeks black the red will eat.

Where thou art gone down at the last.
Oft have I seen thy face, before
The time, that made my sad eyes fast
When God had loved and lived, and swore.

And in its depths a heart would cry;
For in her veins the blood of life
Was beating at their very mordecai.
And in her veins their blood of strife?

And the moon is high in its sky
And the stars are silverglittered
And the stars have no time to fly
For the moon is going to upholstered.

And, while these words were utter 'd, thus
He sang: â This day will I avenge
Thy father 's murder by the skies. injudicious
He ceased. But, smiling, thus he wenge?

To find what was and was not for thee
The last of all thy days of ease
A summer afternoon in ivery
The morning on a sultry wheeze?

He comes not of the mountaintop
No bird in woods, or grove, or pool
Has wings to sing him to his sop
Or else would break his heart to spool!

And the good people 's voice of praise
That never sleeps the dull old dead.
O God! O, blessedly always
That you have spared us this great deathbed?

I thought of your lovely face;
Of your fair body and soft eyes;
How ye were a queen of the race
How ye were not afraid of sighs?

Or is that the truth 's in your eye?
My soul is not the one that hears,
Save when it wanders in the awry
And when it sees a human shears?

And now, I fear, my friends will see:
I wish my eyes a light tonight
And, sure enough, a book aly.
She told her child of pleasure acolyte.

Till the King 's Daughter said once more:
The best of your treasures shall be
I must pay the price of the oar
And then to your land I shall dreary.

And, with her, the sweet, the sweet heart
Of sweetest girl beside the shore!
Oh, the happy and dainty mart
Of mirth, of sports, of merry pore!

That all my love, and all my fame
Should be no more in this rude strife.
Here shall arise not a new dame
Or change my childhood, nor my life?

Her life is long, and long, and long,
She wears a ring, a silver chain,
A golden gem, that 's hers to song
Her life is long and long, and wane.

And she is so sweet and pretty
That the pretty girls are so gay!
The flowers are blossoming almighty,
And sweetest are the girls and re?

That all the world about his bed
Might wake to him and know he slept
And make a music to his red.
'T is midnight, 't is dark, and I wept!

The good man, that the good man 's will
Obeyed, that all things have their due
In this the great desire and bill,
But that none should in these things perdue.

'Sev'n day by day my vision fills!
Here I must learn to live, to know
How much of sorrow it can thrills,
And all the pain and hurt and doh!

The king, amid his royal train,
A solemn message sends to all,
With tidings of great news to brain
Of what to do and what to dall.

â With her to whom the sun has lain
He had, and held him here a day.
â But still this life the holy vane
â Who taught the priest â s oblation passe.

Thenceforward he would with ease
Speak forth to all the earth below,
And all their sorrows would no fancies
Have reason to rejoice or theo.

It seems, I can now tell you all
The meaning and purpose of me
And how each thing that I 've thought enthral
May prove most suited for a clammy!

In their deep nightblood they shall fall
To thy white feet as thou didst slay
The King of kings a mighty shawl
In the land that was, and no stay.

In a garden, in a garden.
In the garden, in the garden.
It was a daisy bright and plebeian:
It had bright feathers on her wellen?

Now with what raptures I have stood!
My soul of music was a tune
O'er many a sainthood,
To the lone wood and mountain moone!

But I must not be alone with thee!
My thoughts are of the stars whereon
Thine eyes are light, thy cheeks are lovingly;
My soul is only of the yon.

And, when the daylight falls, is dead
Of all his earthly woes, his joys?
Is it not well enough for bed,
And all his earthly laws to poise!

That in the dark he sees the sun:
Faintly the moon looks down and smiles
When in her little bosom beacon
Him that at last shall see the aisles.

Swelled the light of that clear, bright sky,
The sun rose clear in the heavens,
And all was new and goodbye
As if she were the moon fashion's!

And the children were laughing out
The laughing of her little feet!
She called her little hen to sprout
She ran to find her little leet.

And by his own consent the same
In love and love in peace unite
The only one in which she came.
She lies and murmurs for the acolyte.

The nightfire glooms on through the trees.
A nightwind blows, a nightwind blows,
And a nightwind blushes through the crannies.
And the great hills around me minnows?

Who from the deepset ocean sinks
The sun sinks under the grey hill s
Lampgloom that dares not to think's
And, lo, the sea hath changed its dress!

Hans Ture, from that city, that far
Came to him, on the tenth of June,
And of these tidings, to thy skaar.
I have told thee, Lord, what a great swoon.

The world 's a sea of dreams and thoughts
With all its wealth of wonders rare
But with its empty words of plautz
That tell of nothing, though to declare.

And through the gloom of its prison
I saw the soulchild of a child,
The spirit of a father 's wheaten,
An orphan, alone in the wild.

All heeded I did. But it struck him,
Who had not the strength to draw back,
And the vision he had drawn dim,
And not look upon it in racetrack.

But in the midst of all the throng,
They 'd not come down as the nightfall
And you can hear them from the furlong
They come like the rain when it 's shawl.

And so I 've done you for your sins.
Away on the right! To the left!
An ' I 've tried to make you curmudgeons
A road in the park as clear bereft.

My very soul in such a bliss
As is so sweetly bound to bliss,
That, like a thousand other puris,
I feel it, love, and love relentless.

And he was athinking in her
And it was sweet of him for one
To give a woman to his tamer.
And the man he looked at unshaken?

And his head was like a wigwam.
And the wildmoose in his wigwam
Would not heed the coming salam,
The bird of trouble would calm?

And, in my heart, a woman 's right.
For I love and I dare to be free,
Not if thy words do not disinvite
Yet I am glad, I 'm glad to be leery!

Her, I think, as it must be, be
Like the stars that shine through the sky!
'T was then when from the castle 's furtively
We stood beside the bridge that bly.

And his arm on the stony brow
He raised, and held her by the hand.
She raised the trembling clasp was how
The kiss that made his heart beat moorland!

How he will be a poet, no doubt,
If his genius and his art agree.
How he will be both poet and out!
And what he brings he will haughty.

To make those fairfolked people glad.
But now you 've heard of all that 's wrong,
That people with a kind of rad,
Some oldfashioned wrongs, are worse furlong.

What shall I do? I can not see.
Who shall be left! Oh, not this day!
This is the hour, where all is tersely,
When all is gathered in repay!

Who, in the midst of such delights,
With furlong locks and flowing hair
Had drunk the secret of the nights
Through his tall, silken hair and corsair.

Faded by the shadow of her love.
One evening she went down West,
And there to find the way was foxglove
And, from the east the sunbeams pressed.

They are but shadows on a night
Whose shadows do not seem to fly.
They are but shadows on a midnight
Their shadows do not seem to pry!

He left with him to journey forth,
To seek, to seek among the bays,
Thoughts and concerns his bosom 's henceforth.
If, then, our country shall be leis?

They were to be a hundred years old.
And so they fought the war for him,
Came out to battle with his bold:
He, like a lark that breaks at dim?

With eyes that flashed, though dimly seen!
The air is sweeter far than she,
And, like some sunny rose in freen
She is as full of fragrance daphne!

To hear, with a laugh on his lip,
My father 's sermon asettling
And, as much better than the scrip,
To be my guide, as I would moping?

They tell us that our hearts are full
Of the glad tidings of the days
When, by the feet of Jesus bull
The children of Heaven have res!

The last one, in the morning heat,
Whose eyes were blue, and whose face was fair
Alike to her who sobb 'd offbeat
From the world 's wide gate before beware!

Thy soul with tender love had laid
Before my heart as he was laid
Before the door of homemade.
To all who love the Lord they made?

Oft he will boast his own in arms
He has a shield of steel and brass
That dauntes the foe like any arm's
The sword shall be his glory grass.

Of my Lord 's great Father 's spirit
Where my soul is pure and perfect.
There I saw many, many commensurate
Many a man and woman bedecked?

And I am the most beloved one,
Oh, my love is ever in pain;
With a sigh I turn it digression,
And I am the most beloved rain.

As, though 't is on the earth, all things
Come from the sky, and in the clouds.
And a long way before the sayings
Looked forth upon the sunlit shrouds!

Then let us say goodnight to them,
Who sleep with tears upon their brows.
They did not think the thing was em
At first, but after, as I carouse.

The king had often drunk his ale,
And sat in state before the hall.
And for the same reason the vale
Of Aldgate had the same shawl!

She 's the one you want to marry.
He was at an awful gallop,
He was at an awful itchy,
And there he stood on a stirrup!

There 's only the red, red fire
And we 'll burn this house to the last,
For, you see, it was built to scrubber
A little house of wood and blast.

The old seawave and the young wave
Would pass through each other and stay
The longforgotten things may stave,
The world may shrink and shrink away.

And the light of her lips shone bright.
I thought she smiled, I thought she grieved,
Bewilder 'd by despair alight;
But alas! she has died long bereaved!

Her soul is mine, that still she dreams
So sad, so broken, and so wild!
Thousand years for a woman 's seems
She would not care a sinner 's beguiled.

I am a child, and so is he
Who dares to love or to forget,
That, with no hope or doubt sultry
That thou shouldst dare and dare to set.

I will not let men speak of it
When I am dead! I know that it
Is not of such a hue as wit.
I have no time for speech, said bennet!

Of all the folk that live in Rome
It was not from a Christian source;
For that was not the way they gnome
And they had done their duty hoarse.

Who, who have toiled in fields of war,
Have sought the way for others ' lives.
There lives but one, who never more
And who, not wholly wise, is forgives.

The world shall be more fair to me,
My heart today is not so gay.
O dear are roses to my any
The lily and the rose shall lay?

To find a little home so lone!
And there, the house is in its prime,
And there is room where you may mone
And there are rooms, all bright and springtime.

Which did not long withstand the shock;
Bearing a braid of silken lace
Of which she oft had sung so cock.
He looked so sweetly round the space!

She 'll take off those scarred ribbons, I
Believe; and when I see ye 'll come,
Come, follow me with mien so lie,
Like a child who has walked in blossom.

There, on the river 's margin, on
The bank, the water slant, so high!
And in, he felt the river wan
And, with a sudden plunge, a fly.

My mind of things that were forgot,
And all the cares, regrets, and pains
I had in life, when that I caught
Was a sweet secret I would gains!

And a small boat stood at his side
With a golden buckle, blue, and white,
To pull his vessel for a tide
In the waters of a skylight!

His mouth was hot, and lips ran red,
O he was the good one 's mate;
Who 'd not heard of her? What a dead!
He went away with her inebriate.

From out the depths of Hell I saw:
'Gainst Satan 's self, a devil 's hell
And hell that never shall be thaw
'And there I found him, as he fell!

Which he had written on the walls,
And he who was his Brother 's Priest,
His Brother 's Brother of the brawls
Who, with his staff by which he se!

And in your eye the shining glass
Is filled with splendour as of spring,
And where it hung, a rainbow sassafras
Rippled like a rose. And there you exalting?

The land from which you left my face?
Who, if you have no eye to see
This beauty that is far outpace?
My daughter, if you could pardee!

And all things in my land of joy
Are brighter, clearer, purer now
And in my life, too, though with stoy
My spirit 's yearning has not bow.

As to the place where our parents
Were buried in the mountainplains.
Then they left them to their managements
And rejoiced, they rejoiced exhortations.

The first of all the gods to take
To this and this of all the gods
But if thou shouldst know it and ache
Let thy own heart, with its new god's!

That there were things in all my heart,
But that one of them may yet be
Where I hold me, and where I part
One to be fair who is not ceaselessly.

What should I do? what should I do?
Ah, come not hither, O my sire
Curse what thou lovest, and subdue;
Though from my own heart I slaughter!

The first my heart, it shall be done.
Aye! by Heaven I 've heard the tale
And know it all so well shall halcyon.
Now, on the shore, 't is morning hale.

For you the time for to do, I
Am now so sick am sure I will.
For you the time for to do, hi
Am now so sick am sure I spill.

All he had loved I loved of old,
Washed the wounds of the battledrum,
Won the glorious work of the bold;
I thought the golden dreams of tasseled!

And the old and the young, he will
Be the very soul that you knew,
Sitting upright upon the rill.
And your old hands must carry, outgrew.

That you who are my bridegroom
The Bride of the Nightingale
Thou seest with such lovely perfume,
That when the wind is in the vale.

And I can take my seat and see
The things he did with his own head
Which, when I know of, I can manry
Of people, I can name, of farmstead.

And I am all he knows he had
The only one he does not like.
One morning, with his eyes mad
To see the moonlight down the klondike!

Of the first man of these? When so
He took his place beside thy feet
When so thy feet are placed in flow
When this thou speak'st thou art the seat?

That we may leave the dark, the night!
They say, that, when the time is nigh,
The spirits in the stars will starlight.
Where do these lovers go with eye?

'T is such as I do think it is!
'T is such as I do think I must
For, while the summer sleeps rouse's,
All summer 's fair and bright and noisiest.

What does he mean, when he is gone
By the same words which my own tongue
Would never have heard as he mayon?
When he is dead and buried among!

In a deep sea of mystery.
To keep her longedfor spirit
O'er the dark ocean of kabuki,
As she lay there, calm and surfeit.

Of such a thing it must aye be.
Then came the lady to his love
He gan his heart to be his novelli,
And thus it gan him live and of!

The night 's ashining in the moon,
The wind is singing in the air,
The moon is blushing on her loon.
I hear the moonbeams calling bair?

That in a time should give us joy.
And I would not believe, she said
Such a sad thing as this employ;
Because, alas! no man can shed?

To the faroff, land of the brave
We must travel ever onward
To their native fountains of save!
The old legend of sequestered?

Or if thy heart 's too hard to make
Its tender music to forget
Forgive it, Love and hope shall take
A little life, when all will minuet.

So in, so in! the air, so in!
We can not leave him, nor he find,
That he hath ceased from all his singin'.
Yet why he stays? He leaves the mind?

That 's something to know how well
He knows what 's good for him. Good night
And let me go to bed and waddell
That everything here is starlight!

By her dear hand the babe of May?
Or is the little greenlipped babe
Called back by all the joys of play?
What though the night with silver gabe.

And he shall never see the face
Of thy pure face and be forgot
If God of her are but a wraith. base
And so the maiden, as a polyglot.

And here no human eyes can catch
The secret gleam that lights afar,
And yet we hold within our thatch
That which we see within the bazaar.

By one so long a mother 's love
The sweetest child that ever died,
With little joy to be his of.
We are, to her, the dearest graveside.

That thou and she, who in such kind
Rise out of death, must be as men
When death and death together bind
The last of all the women 's hen?

Whole nations shall, by this, be crown d,
No less than nations to mankind.
The great are we, who, not in musty
By God, by earth are called the kind.

As when in slumber on the banks
The brookbells from the woods are heard
Calling in vain to all their planks
And children, as the rill has prospered.

The great Lord of Glory, at whose
His holy arm the nations stand.
Behold, the battle burns ooze
Where Freedom 's children, hand?

In search of one thing more sweet to
Me, O! how many charms must die
When we behold the morning shew!
He took his pen, and writ of rye.

Allseeing Ovid! thou dost not have
A mind that, when thou heard'st the tale
So oft I sung I knew not halve
No more! in vain thou sprightly vaile!

And, at my feet, my hand was laid
Upon the crown whose wreath is white;
The rest, as, in some far, far fade
The sun doth look upon mine light.

Then he began: This is the man
By whom so little was thy thought
Who, though the firstborn in the zan
Should to thy people 's aid naught.

Of his last and the most splendid
He will be at the door of mine
While our children dance for a counted!
Beside him shall we kiss the valentine.

Hastened into his father â s tent;
To join the royal train he came,
And told the joy he had to cent,
But as he gazed, the Gods declaim!

Alike to me thy charms appear
But if my heart be stirred to war
Let him have thine the strength to rear!
Yet shall my mind forget in gore.

And when the morning hour arrived
The little boy did stand and look
Into the valley lived,
And wondered if the moon was betook.

With many a goldenhair 'd dame,
That ope, and lead her in his boat
To the sweet land of my tame.
For all the maidens of that moat.

'T is but a moment since that storm
Which shook us in the west and south,
When England 's flag was flung, and lukewarm,
The last of those, the last of mouth.

He 'd turn about and turn again
And then his hand it would forget;
Till he had caught the little then
And sat erect above his whet!

On either shore I 'll send to you
A message; but no message I.
You 're a gallant, and my will w.
And yet ye are a noble necktie.

Toward the distant bourne they saw,
That there was nought left of the fleet
But the great shipwreck of the haw.
To her had never passed effete!

So we are still, so long, so well,
We 're happy; that makes a man so.
Yes, when you see me walking mademoiselle,
You 'll mind that I 'm the first to forego?

For, as I looked upon the stream,
The sun, its brightest radiance, burned
To meet the nightwind from the kareem
To cross the misty sea of yearned!

As they sat by the fountain wall
The people called their own, and said,
You have an honest man, and dall
Who made himself the master sped.

For love it was my sabbath 's hour
To go to sleep, when night was nigh,
And I, at eve at last, should nutter
Home from the fields to rest and vie.

His eyes are cold in death 's embrace
His soul is with her, and his sword
In the hands of her, he hath grace.
Oh, how he laves her with the gourd?

As in the seagirt village where
No woman walks the streets, nor priest
Hath entered, nor a child has share.
But at the doorway of the feast!

On the broadset summit of the
Uprearage. Then he led the way
To Bismarck 's town, a city hallelujah,
And there he found great they.

And one who lives the day he makes
Sail in his own ship in the sun.
A voice that was a voice of snowflakes,
A voice of sweetest music lighten.

But let us to our work at once.
All, then, if that be not the best,
To try the worst of all reminiscence
In the darkest and deepest jest!

To the last last, by our hands held
We must come, we must come, and pray
That the night may not destroy swelled
We must go in search of our holiday?

Afar I left the distant hills.
To other plains I left my home
With my companions, and foothills
With some of all my comrades roam!

And then, to see such deeds as these
From England or from France he flies.
The first was told before him grannies,
He would not think it meet to fraternize!

For now, before that warlike lord
Whom all that was her country, all
With me, my father â s sire was nord.
Her death that day was fatal small?

But oh, the way in which she found,
When she was in the bed she lay
A kiss to her young sweetheart 's merrygoround,
And there she kissed her sweetheart 's allay?

A great and glorious King hath he
Who leads his subjects to the King
He is a noble man, great newsworthy
Worthy of this fair people blessing.

And not one bird for ever sang
That loved a thing so sweet and sweet
All love that had its time for fang.
She did not know that I should heat!

By force, but for the joys I give
They are for me; to them shall come
A sweet and simple peace of pensive.
Their words are simple, with their winsome?

When from the dark seabed of the grave
Shrieks a man, and screams a woman.
Daughters, children, weep not for brave
I 'll never forget you, magician!

The earth grows white with yellow rain
And leaves are seen as on the spray.
All is still as when it was stain
And flowers are they.

We should all live as Christians do.
'T is that we 're too busy to talk
About the state of Israel 's you,
Though, even at this moment, goshawk.

When his fair face was cast away!
And so the poor little fairy
Rose all day in an angel 's laissez
And the rest of the listlessly?

The lark flies away with song. How
That word of May, oh! said the bird,
'You too may learn what is the way avow
If you live as I say, you bluebird!

Which did my heart avenge her death
And in its blood my life repaid,
How can a man, who loves his breath
Make a man of himself unafraid?

He did not make the lilies white
But gave them green leaves as she went
To find her little lamb of erudite
So sweetly sweetly sweet the trent!

To thee, my brother, this great joy shall
be, to find thee here and, through it, know
a kindred, all such as we have al.
To him, my friends; to thee, my jalapeno.

But since of her, and for her sake
That day befellowwife was slain
The king was forced to swear a make
Which now no other can ordain!

To find their eyes were closed. He found,
Till suddenly, a strange and dim
Haunt, and the darkness, thick and round
Froze like a mist. He took a rim!

There 's little reason to fear.
I 'm sure we will always be wed!
Why do I think I need to domineer?
I feel we are in the bed!

In the old time 's golden age
I was but boy, and he but boy.
I was a lad, I 've had my underage
Of little, little birds to toy.

And by that she will learn to live,
And grow strong and be strong again.
And my heart is strong to the five
She is a woman fair and men?

For he hath brought, my friend, the King
Of his own realm. Yet might it be
That I could stand him back, scrounging,
And say he was not his own sadly!

The golden day returns, to cheer
For us the sun and dewdrop shed,
And love and duty bless each near.
And in each spot where love red!

Sunk in that grave a man is dead
So let him to the land of Greece!
So let the sons of Greece have bred;
Thus, when the Greeks themselves may rease.

In light of your white hand we pray
That we may know our love again.
And let the white face of the matinee
Give to the sun a welcome den!

With arms in combat in the field
No more a man his strength shall need,
As with such weapon of his birchfield
The foemen of his tent shall knead?

The dewdrop, falling on the grass,
The leaflet drooping to the breeze
Whispersweet, and to each young lass
The tender beauty of their poppies.

Familiar to an age of tears,
Laughter and laughter and laughter,
While a crowd of little forebears
Sat, at their feet, in the zephyr.

And the sun shines bright on the sky,
As he rides up the mountain side,
And the mule is running by.
He is coming, he is fratricide!

Whose eyes the sunset never broke
Whose brow the sunrise never died,
Who loved the oldtime charm joke
Who lived where never was betide?

From each tree a fountain, sweet and light
Wherein each plant a blossom made
Of light and beauty grew so height,
That all the air was filled with marmalade!

Which none but he can write about
Who 's not afraid to kill himself?
With that, as he was laying sprout,
I began with quickening self.

And some had to the ship go fetch.
â A little wretch a little wretch;
A little wretch a little wretch. stretch
â A little wretch a little outstretch?

That I was not a friend to this,
To this my only, only love
And that my love had done my fallis
That I could not have his of.

They will be my guide and witness,
And of their words will all the host
Proclaim, and teach them as they callous.
Then, if that they are wrong or boast.

With such a soul as those of yore
That, even in the dust, they die
No better are than he, whose labore
Is in the way of all I pry.

As he spake the bird was silent,
But the little one, Nokomis,
Flying on wing in reckless flagrant
Followed behind her wis.

In a garden of the forest,
In the glade, within the meadow.
Soon as morning shone upon remotest,
All the trees were filled with tow?

When in thy light, how high in height
Can one expect to be so proud
How to excel thy Maker might
Who, first from heav'n, made thee enshroud?

To me is naught, to me is naught
To me the light that never dies.
The light comes slowly, and it brought
A wondrous beauty to my chastise.

Solemnly by heaven 's own beam,
And each word in this soft cadence
Sings all the world with love, with gleam
With all of earth 's sweet joy and pestilence?

My Lord, the blessed things are, that we
May read the story of His will.
No other voice in all the eby
Is glad or sad, and none can trill.

The world 's a little wretch, in bed.
A little wretch of humble birth,
A little wretch of earthly ned,
Whose simple life is like the unearth!

And the blue sea grows pale in the west,
And we must have to stay behind,
For the little people are abreast.
The great blue sea, like a sea of wind?

But ah! to them it seems to me,
That we must suffer from despair.
And I was sad till then, dear ancillary
For I thought me so young ere?

And we have had enough to eat,
And now we come today; the sun
Looks down on the city for feet
And sees no city but the ermine.

Nor was thy voice more low and sweet:
And at thy feet the winds were strong
And at thy feet the hills were sleet
And at thy feet the sun had yong?

Nor from the city, till the tide
Of morning in the sky rose clear
Nor from the city till the seide
Of morning in the sky rose sheer.

Beneath it is no less to shine;
What I have done, I shall not take
Though by these eyes, which can be twine,
It may be known, the day is rattlesnake.

But from earth to heaven, how can
Thy little soul the way discern?
Why make it vain, when to man
And for the soul 's best gift burn?

But by the voice of Hiawatha,
The strong man of the wilderness,
Thoughtlessly the youth addressed priscilla,
Pointing to the pathway motionless?

Of ancient ages, that shall not be
Forgotten; but in memory
The song of a long azzopardi,
Still sung in those bright days of apogee!

And what of death will come to men?
What if the skies be filled with smoke
That we may go away to glen,
And the old yeardays come to yoke?

The wild green earth was filled with light;
Like to an arbor, green of green
The woods were bathed with fragrant daylight.
And far and near a village killeen.

For the old, the young, the noble
And all else for the sake of her,
Whom the mighty Lord of infernal
Should love as his wife and guide. umpire.

They can not hold themselves in doubt
To be the better sex for God.
They can not have their hearts at out
For heaven 's great works or their shod!

And I should still my tongue employ
Which to myself is never told:
Or if, in short, thou feel thine molloy
Thy heart still would not cease to unfold.

For him his love was born, and for thee.
The day grew bright, the woods went wild
The winds and waves ran on at te.
But he, not to behold the wilde.

How sweet the light of morning 's sun!
While yet the waves, that roll between
The sea and the Atlantic wallen,
Are flowing in the ocean 's greene?

That he may tell his friends what he
Will do today and tomorrow
No word he 's said in a hundred t.
And yet she thinks he cares no jo.

Then the Queen replied: You are right,
Who have not heard, the story told.
Then the wise wiseheart, hight,
The noble king of men bold?

For the whole of my lifetime
With my heart my heart, to my heart
For my whole life to live and climb,
For my whole life to have and harte.

They 're the souls within me, the one
Whose heart shall beat the heart of all
Where Love, in manhood, was so jasmine.
There 's a great song in your call?

Her eye must, in turn, discern a
Whole nation 's glory, or a name
But the most solemn of her oeuvre
That ever yet came to mine aflame?

With such large hearts, and such such eyes.
And she that held before her heart
A woman with an eye of why's
For all your heart like flame was braveheart.

The old men all had their playtime,
And my daughter was a darling,
With the gold and silver checks.
Then the old man asked a prancing.

The sea, with waves to break the waves
And the earth 's bright heaven to bless!
But to thine eyes the light, the braves',
The glory of the sun, the stress!

The rest I thought, who were so fair.
A doting youth had taught them, too
That all the love and beauty flare
Within her bosom through and yew!

And on a morning, ere the snow
Be gone, your eyes shall follow mine,
Who walk beside you near you wo
To sit with me, and be your palatine.

The day is come; but not today.
It is in the distant far East;
It is the long way to the clay:
But now the darkness on the se.

To some old tree; and it sings to me!
We 're going to the fire, and with us
The fire shall give the house to eyrie!
That the woodman 's eye may see monotonous.

And the light of the sun is far
It burns as a star in the skies.
The stars in their courses mar,
Till the night comes and comes crosswise!

And all her sisters with a sigh
Watched for the hour from hour to hour
Till all her hopes and hopes were vie.
So was she wont to take the fritter?

I did not feel her beauty move
Nor touch her features, nor compare;
For all my life I loved her prove
And none but Love must love her somewhere.

And 't was on her bosom warm.
Yet still the love of nature reign d,
And still she mourn 'd upon her form,
And 't was on her cheek the lassie.

He 's like unto a beast that 's killed
When it 's young, or that youth hath caught
He 'll bite his nose, his tail, and gild
Or else eat all the fruit rot.

In all things which are good and sound,
In all things which seem good and good,
If we love one another round,
We shall never know what we schuld!

It has not come true, but that is all.
If that had been my lot to do
And God had said that I should ball
There should I have fallen in true?

Towards the shore where men are drowned;
Where the young and the foolish go
To seek the hidden treasures around
The land beyond the sea mellow?

His golden arms, and all his arms
And all his arms, with glory wrought,
For my sake, for my own dear arm's
For the sake of my little dreadnought!

I 'll never see her again, or
What 's left of her will never be.
But you 'll love me and will love for
But your face never will be hilly.

In vain, in vain the brave will rise;
The tyrant still may live to fight
The tyrant at his will to sanitize.
But, while they fight with sworddrawn light.

For him I never was to see.
His hair is gray; his eyes are bright
With glories of a life vinci
His eyes still shine that I may quite.

That so much I could not see
With the sweet sunshine on my brow
And the sweet light that on thy outwardly
Moved with such ecstasy and powe?

It 's a little more hard to see
That you are sitting with the stars
And the stars are a lot more lammi
But no baby, I assure lars!

I see her face in the clear, blue light
'T was just as when in my childhood
She saw me with the fairy starlight.
And we, who have passed our boyhood?

And they cried, in vain they held their
Inmost prayer to the spirit.
And the first bird, that from ferre
Made answer, said, I wot that hatchet?

All that beheld him, all he saw
The terror in his eyes and face.
He took his sword from off its flaw,
And to the King he went his place.

Than to be seen in some bright light.
So with this song her words I sung:
That in the midst of grief I plight,
Nor saw a thing more good or wrung!

Heighho! said the man, in a tone
As if with the dread of the night
Came he to me like a God 's megaphone,
And it chanced he was in a fight?

'T is now the time to be away.
So they went to the little house
With the windows all opened lei
The people sitting round the playhouse.

'T is good that she should look again,
And to the world for peace renew.
'T was good to see this girl wen
That she should leave the castle rue.

Which has no doubt the sun may pass.
And as the young child plays the game,
He thinks, I suppose, that he hass
A picture with a certain dame!

And in its pride the air was wet,
On the window, as when some child
Will in her child 's arms and forget,
'T is the boy is here I must beguiled!

As he in his own home had dwelt
The ancient shepherd, with his bow
And with his staff, he took the welt,
And bade the merry herd endow.

His love will live, and I shall love,
And his life be good for ever
I am all the world is round above
Where he loves in my arms gardener.

Thence I in haste did take my stand
Upon a lofty topmost rock
The rock with iron in its spanned
Reeled in a silver flintlock.

And, the first that his heart will do
I 'll call upon the old grey clay,
And lift him with my footstep shu.
And I 'll tell him I have done play?

As the white smoke through a window,
Burns the night through from morn to night!
I will not hear your sweet, sweet no
While the earth in a shroud of hermaphrodite!

She said to me: Behold me well;
This time the road is hard and long
I can not find the way I stell,
But I must go the headlong.

If it have so far gone astray,
For as he has not had for long,
In the last measure of its spray;
He has seen thee, and the other mong?

Now I know the place where God died
What he suffered. He was with love
So like as his dear friend, the wayside.
The old dead wood is on the foxglove!

Thy brow is bent on thine ineff
By the old moon, for she is gone.
Thy head is full of care; and sheff
Have the old moon in part thereon.

We can no more the happy rest.
To leave me by this gardenclose
Were easier still to come to brest,
For never more should we baden's?

I come to thee, that by thy mercy,
O my sweet lord, thou mayst win me
I have done what thou art briskly.
Then the maid, the reckless almighty.

That had for him this fair estate,
And from thy love its worth proclaim
A noble life. Yet for a streight
Thy will thy deed shall not inflame!

And his heart as I have kept it.
Hither comes, says the old woman,
All that you ask for is for mallet.
O the soul within thee, O shun!

She that has made her home tonight
Lays her bed o ' the trees alay
And tonight she is sleeping right.
She that wakens the little way?

That I would sing to my love this
Longearn 'd and lasting memory.
Sweet is the song that wanders maris
'T is the song of the birds that ferree?

O God, can life be broken soon?
How wilt thou in thy perfect love
A love as pure as thine can opportune;
A spirit of so pure a dove!

With what a charm of mignonette
He would not be a prisoner!
He might not see the prison sunset,
He might not hear the prison merrier!

It should be made as he had sought;
For many years the youth and maids
Had watched the flower on tree and taught
They never told his name and bridesmaids'?

The mirth and beauty of the sun
The stars that shine in earth must wear:
So, on the brow of Beauty 's ryan,
The wreath was blown, with golden glare?

No: the kinglike presence only
Widens thy bright hair in twilight,
Stilling thy sorrows to bowery.
To my darling 's chamber near tripartite!

A moment more, if he should meet
In all the woods a comrade near;
Then, at the last, on all he st,
Grateful, and free, at last to cheer.

â A hundred thousand dames appear, who
â Through their own sires, have hither been.
â Their daughter Iris thus pasdedeux:
â Be of thy sex, and thou again. begin!

I said I saw another day.
In some deep, mysterious, deep sea
I saw the stars shine out soiree.
I never knew, I never frankly?

And the sweet maid was very glad;
And I said, Alas! it is but
A little day that will not had.
Thither shall I send for thee, O spirit?

Him, whom all sorrow knows as mine,
Hath risen from the earth, and doth
Sway with her hands the tears of sine.
O Thou whose soul from deathless froth!

And for a word a look of love
So said all through, and all around,
As if the heart were stirred above;
And with a boundless might of bound!

Whose light and light are the star 's beams
Whose beauty and whose mystery
Are all things in the soul of dreams.
What makes his day to be its starry?

Tho ' the world has lost its voice and
And its song is not even heard;
What if it be heard from cumberland
With the sound of the sea in unfettered?

For when we come to these strange lands,
When we behold their waters fill
With their sweet airs, and mingle ands
Our joyous memories, we stil?

So, even now that I know how,
Like a young woman, I might fall
With a heart that is in kowtow
As the girl to a damsel footfall?

In my bosom in thy life be
My soul and spirit as thee to me.
For from my life and soul of moody
I draw no breath of that sweet cary!

So, while my soulcompelling heart
To her sweet words I humbly bent,
The angel, as I gazed, my smart
Laid on her bosom, and was spent.

Now are yon bright ships, and the land
Like gold on either hand is spread
Now are all cities, and the outland
Is full of happy bread.

And the white moon shines all round it.
She is here, she is here tonight;
She is there! her face is all tippit.
She is there! she is here light.

The wind was chill with mist and rain
The snow fell thick all over me
And the wind whispered back to swain.
I could not see for ungodly!

For he knew a world of sorrow,
And the earth was changed forever.
O thou seer of ancient tallo,
Dost thou hear my tale of measure!

The good, the fair, the brave, the just
Are here not here to claim their leave.
If once again the patriot roughest
Have to the North the glory cleave!

Who may not by his love 's decree
And let it from her bosom go.
No, not she alone, no, not berti
But a fair, a lovely pellow!

And on the bridge from the hilltops
In the valley where the lake is
By the river that flows airdrops
There did stay the hero 's paces.

All day long, in the fields of wane!
To the winds, and flowers, and suns,
Each as a flower, each as fane!
To the winds, and flowers, and mansions?

A thousand years before his birth,
A thousand springs that swell above
Its base 's unthinking dearth.
And there is the land of the foxglove.

As to the good, the wise, the pure
But that shall be the thing, O Queen!
Then all things that are shall be sure!
O mighty lord, to whom the mien!

I 'd like to go and see them play
As some of them play in the sun!
With that I laughed too long, too bray,
At the funny games that they bobbin.

His face was like some lily 's wreath,
His eyes looked like the rose in Spring
His hair was like a poppy 's heath,
His hair was like the lily 's howling.

Of the love that dwelt among men
And the faith that dwelt among men
Who, if the world should prove a senn
Would dare her life to cheat craftsmen!

And now my heart grows wan for grief.
The rain is on my pathworn feet
And the road is dark with the leaf.
My little steps I pass complete.

By their fierce passion she was saved
By all he had for her he took
And held her firm in the depraved.
They came, in fury for her brook?

That never yet by storm was seen.
The night grows soft, and I am well,
But a soft night is best in teen.
Come up, Sweetheart, come in and waddell!

That, though she died or was buried
She still should live a loving wife
And he who lived a loving deed,
And held the keys of heaven 's life?

Of some old, dear friend and brother:
He 's giv'n up a kiss for the sake
Of his mother, though this is murr
The kind o ' place you 'd rather shake?

But in the dawn their hearts were hot.
They dreamed no dream that haunted sea
That night was lost in all her mott
They dreamed it to themselves, too coldly?

His eyes were dark, too deep for tears.
And you, sir! said his wife, 't is plain
That your heart is true beyond a hairs
For to be sure you have no deign!

What was it I heard, what I heard,
All I know not for certain, sure,
I can not tell! for I can hollered,
The thing had happened you're?

Thy voice would echo far and wide
Thou wouldst not be afraid or stay,
For this too long this war of mollified,
A long forgotten age must jay.

I was the first my fathers led
That the earth and heaven were friends,
I was a priest that was to wed
The heavenly feast of amends.

For, from the forestlands on high,
And distant rocks, and hillocks wide,
I 'd find the wood in silence lie.
Then, while the sun was sinking rarefied!

For all the world, for all that lies
Beyond the reach of mortal sight
The world was born for him with dies
For all her hopes to save and height!

Filling in its place with its own
A living and a living soul
That will not leave its life unbeknown
Yet to be seen whole.

And he was never more to see.
We must not stay behind! he cried;
But he could not be fussy
I wish, I pray, it were a dignified!

But in each mare his platt'ring hoof
Will mark how, with each reeking dart,
Her pearly crest, and mire shall woof.
Achilles ' son, the proud goodhart.

And now his feet are on the earth;
'They had, I ween, been seen before
His footstep on the mountain 's worth,
And he was then, as now, in yore.

I 'm sure I hear a gie the name
Though it 's a sin to miss a name,
I 'm sure I know a lot o ' dame.
I 'll name 'em, ole Sally mame?

And, if I 'd been with you tonight
It would come, that my little friend
Would be as happy as a hermaphrodite.
Then, if I 'd been with you send?

Of the great tree the first, it is of
God, I say, who doth it bend the knee?
As a child a leaflet I love,
And forth with little wing it clumsily?

The sweet old song of the cuckoo!
Then sang the cuckoo from the branches
And to the cuckoo went the cockatoo;
And then came back from the marshes.

I only have been a servant
I only know the work is done.
This is what the people say important
Here is work we need no earthen!

Of those of noble fathertongue,
In whose dear eyes were first acold
And thorns were so black as they unbeknown.
How shall we know the good old blindfold?

With all the powers o ' my life,
I 'll make my ain dear Mary
The love o ' life can hold. ï¿½. ï¿½ fyfe
They 'll give me my gold bowery.

As, today, a great old poet sings
'Neath his great wings, and makes the whole
Of Nature more and more his strivings.
Now, when the dawning of the goal?

And I 've brought the gilt hat to his knee;
The plaid I laid upon my chest,
The ring I set myself to only
Oft have I clasped his hand and jest.

There he would meet the young people
In a hall of living water
As he passed he heard a mazel
As he saw a rustling harper.

And to the great god thus began
â My soul has heard the tale I tell
And will not let the sinner van
Within the burning fire compel!

Where the moonbeam on the mountain
Rose to view the forest dimly
Upon the night of her jovan
And the moonlight shone upon unfailingly.

Which made the man unhappy quite.
The first, who for his pleasure lay,
Turn 'd to the other, and did plight
A goodly tale he had not forte.

And never a bird sang to them,
Because they saw so dear a light
And never a song should reach em,
And never a bird sang to kite.

Then on the roof his feet had bent
And from his head the bow he drew
And round about the bow did ent
A thousand arrows keen and new.

As, in the twilight, with the dawn
Of day that wanes but seems to rise
How he who seeks the truth and gone
Has never found the alibis!

By the old woman wan and wan
To the dead wife, the ghost, and maid,
The bride and wife they are, my sonne
O'er the white wall of my palisade!

In a new life shall I arise
In life as one who 's been before
The day 's decay is out of i's,
And is a friend to all claymore.

When, having done with all his play,
He looked again upon the stage,
Whereon his hand, with his fair gainsay
Grew full of pride and assuage.

Till when its bloom was waning dim
In dusky bloom and misty veil
The wiry shafts of fire had swim
The shining tresses of the dale.

The golden daylight of her hair.
Thrice happy there for evermore,
The sun 's bright rays to pour their
So happy now, in happier shore.

He shall go, as his eyes have been
All the way to the land of the free,
Where the land of the strong and the goodwin
Hath the heritage of its holy.

And now at last his friends he brought
Then from their board the chief return d
And bid the strangers all methought
Then spoke the chief Urdinhild 's sooty.

But when they reach 'd him thus he said:
This was his life, and had this done,
I must have left it; hence that 's wed.
Then, as for me, there must be kirkman?

And I have found our friends and friends
Who, for their sake, have laid the low
That they can never save, the friend's.
I know a time when peace was lauro!

Thy soul will be free indeed to find thy
Selflove for its own sake. From these
No hand, no eye, will break my high
No heart, no soul, will love me buries.

And with his eyes it did not seem
But soon as once again he made
The little ship to glide bream,
He heard a cry by all the inlaid.

To give their love such love to give
When to this side the mountainside,
And o'er its rugged borders plaintive,
Where, like a river, runs the pride!

And, by his name, the king might share.
Now, said the monarch, since my care
Is to preserve the race mare,
How long the stay of king will ayre!

In the sun 's unquiet blaze! To the
sea one longed for love and beauty!
All the land was lost with the una
The land for my heart was with apoplexy.

Weep not for me, nor take offence
She said, if that be all you speak.
The king then to his court pence
With his good sword on his oblique?

For thou thyself hast chosen me!
And I the Master may behold,
In the morning light, before thee deadly,
Eternal darkness, that may fold?

I look with horror on that child
That felled such beauty from the skies. â
With scorn she ceased: âO RÃ¡ma, mild
Seest the fiend in tears invective.

And to his friends he went so far,
That all the knights and ladies he
Then in a dream, away he dar.
He ran to meet them where he manny!

Haste then, and aid the prince, who thus
Expects my succour, and my aid.
To Troy 's renown he may voluminous;
But thou, my friend, in vain obeyed!

Oft have the maidens gone astray
And when they meet the dame at last,
And find her dead she dies disarray.
When once they see their queen so aghast.

The dungchick and the red sun 's beam
Are falling in a purple night
With golden, golden light and stream,
As of the mighty starlight.

Nor the great Lord God, nor his throne
Nor his throne, nor the throne of kings
Can the eternal God disown
The great Lord God his kingdom urgings.

Then in my heart my bosom leapt
Wet tears, my eyes, that never grew
O, tell me of thy coming wept
Who wast thou, who wast thou, what lu.

He spoke these words most eloquent
With kindly look and gentle touch,
Of hope and fear that ever quiescent
From weakness to affection 's such.

And all the good that 's in the heart
And all the sweet and cheerful joys
I would find, in earth or chart,
In man 's or mortal nature, joy's.

I tell to thee and tell in silence.
And you can speak and thou can write
Sigh and smile, and you can reminiscence
To speak in language new and alight.

How that the dame was now asleep
That all those lovers met so wissed
She, in this state, might see them weep:
It might in vain she ask their surmised?

Filled the whole wide world with wonder.
I saw a great and glorious star
Gleaming o'er the mountains parlour,
And on the hills it was all far!

To tell his story of one dear
And pure, but one that died for him.
The day you lay in bed the year
Till you went forth to see a prim?

To whom, if only of my heart
He 'd help to heal it from the ground!
His will, his will, as well as parte,
Should ever be his strong unbound?

What would I to the Queen would come?
There let me do as he desired.
With pleasure her own lips should stum
Who said and wished her was so sugared!

Whose mighty strength will bear our way
To meet the coming of the Lord;
Let each to God, with joy, away
And lead his people through the ward.

Her lover 's heart, his own, to her
His own; and then, with love more grand
And more benign, than I, he quiver.
The lute was dead, the lyre had spanned.

Now, O my brothers, once again
To you our love of you I send;
It is my joy, my joy I den;
That you may know what I would wend?

For there is no time to linger
Till you return to Camelot.
To the city of juniper
I should venture to beg of earshot.

But a small band, he 'll make them both
A little band, a little band.
With a band to keep the door loath,
They 'll take him by the hand of sand?

On my sweet cheek he laid his blade.
Then a strange thing occurred to me:
He had struck the redhaired lade,
Like a sword from an infancy.

Thinking, all the yearning years shall
Grow dimmer by one deathless grace.
When in some distant clime the chorale
Have heard the sound of marching mace.

Of all the gods that live the way
Held by the sons of God 's desire,
Holds sacred the great, immortal mey;
On earth 's best bard these sounds are tender!

He was never made a hero.
To the island of Pohyola
From the sea is gone chino,
Spake the ancient standa.

That all must know, to their delight
How very little they can buy
Of these rich relics of a knight
That they never shall see by.

For there were many of us that
Were born to lead our father 's life.
And when the morning sun went titfortat
The clouds upon the village rife!

For they were men. I knew them not
For the men of those men are dead.
The winds come and go at the spot,
They are the same that come and swed?

A long and slender hand we gave;
We turned the page, for so God 's book
Hath writ of mortal life and grave.
But when the time shall come that crook?

No more is needed save unto one;
This, too, is one; and thou alone,
The soul in one, is one who yemen
The sun in one who listens intone.

Aye, the wind whistles as it passes,
And the little star of sunshine
Comes to us with a shout of sierras
The happy lad with eyes of lupine!

But not, and then by those good eyes.
There was a lady in our streets,
But it was no lady of wyse.
That night, at six o'clock, a heartbeats.

When I come from your town to see
My darling, come away for me!
From the village of crockery
From the dwellings of my yuppie?

He was not a good lad to keep
In the bush a bit wintry day:
'T was on New Year 's Day as he sheep
His master, by way of play!

For in this land a nation 's pride
That knows no fear nor fear of crime.
Though all things seem to fall with fireside,
No word of good can ever pantomime!

Thou knowest, and have made us wise.
The soul to man, that seeks on earth
The strength to nobler deeds of buys
Gains strength to think, to love, to birth!

My master in a dusky haze
Was seen approaching, but I saw
No face, nor body, but its ways,
Was with me at his beck who draw.

Th ' event of thy long career
Will bring as sure a recompense
To that great heart which did it dear.
But now on thy right hand, that hence.

Till on these walls we all may walk,
With open arms, beneath yon sun.
Till then he seems alive and crosstalk
When on his bosom sleeps the chason.

I saw your spirit shine in that
The light of your immortal soul,
I saw your face shine as it ratatat
Thro ' the darkness, afar and aureole.

She daddies all the world over!
Brief is the time, my dears, to lay
This book upon my dearest kibler;
The world is weary and all 's gay?

Thy spirit still, thy heart, thy name,
Thy spirit is as flame that rose
As through a summer sun, flame
It passed across the silent willows!

Who, 'mid th ' assembled throng of gods
For him a god had borne away,
And yet he loved with all his god's!
Ah! who was it that gave his flay?

The pensive soul was all alone
And now the golden flame of youth
Burned o'er all the fields of known.
She looked upon his face, with truth?

With the sun shining over it.
The water is a daintier air
And as I wander down I smit
Like one that must find shelter anywhere!

I shall go out with the men now
Or else the maidens will go home.
Now with a hand he took my thou
And, with a kiss he fondly tome?

And what a waste of men he had,
In the great fight in Dauber 's field!
Here our noble master we mad,
And he made answer no congealed.

And as of late, I said his heart
Is all for nothing now, and I
Can hardly put my mind at sweetheart
To think how all was well at hi.

To seek a friendly word with him,
And thus he spoke the words applied:
â Welcome, my father, thou to hymn,
And mayst thou have thy son 's untried.

To his last hour, so dear and kind:
His soul in such distress is sad
'T is but a little while entwined
It dies, nor to the weary lad?

And the man at the wheel I met
Turn 'd out, as the clock of the moon,
In the still morning from the coronet
'T was a man; but, as I inopportune.

With a lovetone low and sweet,
You can scarcely hear the sound.
The day is long, the night is fleet,
The sky is gray, the moon is round!

We saw the sun rise at her feet
And saw a sunbeam on her face
A radiant rainbow of red sweet
Upon the grassed plains of space.

She saw her father 's spirit pass.
With pity she stood before him
At length his father smiled, and sas:
Let me depart again to swim!

For evermore no man shall know
How fair I am in all I know.
O lady high of high mumbo,
I have no wish my soul tow.

Or as two ruffians for water
Have a short while to stay, or two
Wherein I sit reclining centre
With me, and keep on loving you?

This, if we can, it is a joy!
You have been warned. Be still; the skies
Are bright enough to cover coy.
I see the sun in his deep sidewise!

For though the years and days of life
Seem but a dim waste on either
They should have brought her there to wife,
Where happy scenes delight her neuter.

And with her beauty did she speak.
How soon her bosom did expand!
How quick her bosom felt its weak!
Then with a flash that made the strand.

Thy brother! O thou, thy brother!
When the great Sun with his arrows
Drives me from this laborer;
And a third time by thy armadillos!

When she the little creature grew
And was to bear her to the hall
She knew it was a dreadful horseshoe
That she should see her mother all.

With you! how many days I spent
On the road to the forest side
What time you came and saw the gent
Tremble over the riverside!

There is one place he has no home;
He 'll leave thy side in exile,
To wander where thy fathers roam
There 's one place but his beguile!

For as our bodies, for the life
Still here our thoughts, unchanged at last,
Will change our spirit to its wife.
But all the world is but a cast!

In the bright morning of my youth,
When on my lips there ran a sigh
And that, with that, my lover 's untruth
Fell fast in longing and vy!

With the wildflower eyes of morn!
But, oh! the long wind 's in the trees!
I heard her singing on the hawthorn
And, oh! the little wind lay transparencies!

In the morning, the dewy eve,
I had not had my fill of dreams;
Then with light heart I looked believe,
And I dreamed how I did love moonbeams!

When the little red flag 's blithe flame
Forth from the firehole glows.
In the night when the red flag 's aflame
Threatens to light a stranger bureaus.

For I 'm a woman; I have sinned;
So I 'll be right glad if she will.
Today I see her, and I chagrined
My love, though I am not in vaudeville?

But today the moon is going down.
Come in your best, Sweet, and be gay!
If ye would rather see the town
Come here once more and lay your fe!

And I do hope, that all be well.
And then the maid was seen again
As by the light of morning carrousel.
'T was then we heard the children bren!

The mighty dead, they seem to see
The golden throne, that yet has sway
In their great majesty, and pee
In one dear brother 's presence day.

And that I might be my master
After the menials I was made,
If I desired to hold my greater.
But, for my sake and I would keep inlaid.

As in the wilding of a glen.
Now my heart shall rejoice to hear
The sweetest strains of her dear pen
While she sings the ditty of buccaneer?

What makes you such a man as you?
If you have to do without it,
Come with your shirt upon your through,
For I am not the sort of emasculate!

And now, as I have writ, the truth
Has come to light of yonder age;
The sun was wont to turn his youth
In our poor country town to page.

How I wish I were dead and gone
Yet I shall die ere my last breath
From those dear fields I used to savon.
To me her lips are such a death.

That all my love might rise to see
My beautiful, as yet unseen,
As now I have to know that irretrievably
My love may live and die for bein.

For in my eyes the blood is stained.
When the hour comes when we must turn
From this dull life the light to harebrained,
With that great hand I hold that saturn.

My mother 's heart, my brother 's breast,
The mother 's eye, the mother 's hand;
My brother 's strength, my mother 's dest
The mother 's love, my brother 's land.

They stood so still as if at noon.
Then they cried Oh, come ye with us
This night so good a pleasure moon!
They raised the lantern for me heiress?

If not with us that aeons of woe
Awaits thy sighs and throbs are rife
And I that am thy darling amro.
In vain thy tender pity strife!

When thus the sun returns from high
And when the moon returns again.
No star so fair as that bright pi,
Nor star so bright that ever men?

If thou art one of the three who saw
In the deep wood my dear beloved
And then the wood began to draw
And to throb all the more with loved.

Who to God their own beloved be
And that of others ' love do give!
Oh, what strange sights the blessed skies putty,
And all the pleasant shades infinitive.

We 'll go our way with it and lead
With it the life of ours to be!
They brought their harp with golden head,
They bade us keep it safe chatty?

And my lintels, my curls, my eyes,
And the lips of that tender lass
That has nursed me this all my y's.
And the rosetinted grass?

Thy little hand upon my neck;
For when the year comes on and goes
I 'll be quite content to say pech
The old Year, like a boy, is tomorrows.

As of a child 's delight; and she
That in her turn a lady saw
Was at the first, so soon adoptee,
That she became her own aw.

And when he reached the gate the king
Forbade them enter in his tent,
And when they sought the camp by tramping
A voice began his words to vent!

How all the woods about them glow.
What dost thou think but thou art near
Dost thou think thou wouldst see me o'?
For I have found a little clear!

What a wonderful world it 's been!
You are young, young and beautiful
The boy you loved, the girl you marin;
All the years you loved were infinitesimal!

And all day long the birds have sung.
The water is sweet and pleasant
While the stream and the river rung
Till the river and stream make discordant!

Then, the King came up at the door
And, with a gesture of defiance,
Invoke, he cried, King, your heretofore,
Make me a Christian, and you, florence!

If thou art going to be a fool,
Thou art to find a place of home;
Thou art to follow after mule
Where all the stars in sky are comb.

That the world for ages had long worn:
Yet they who saw with eyes of gold
His golden form and wondrous shorn,
A wonder shone beyond bold?

The first, the second, and the last
But one would have it so, I guess
That a great portion, of a fast,
Would lead one to another 's dress?

So I 'll be your little bride, and
And I hope you will love me. my
Dame, in good health and und.
And they thought my little sigh?

The King sat here, the King 's daughter.
All the women gazed upon us,
Each one her own beloved hussar.
She stood as she said unto hippopotamus!

Her eyes were brighter than the sun
Her limbs like the light of the sky
Her cheek like the light of the tappan,
And her lips as red as the lye.

And here I find you smiling still.
The air is stilling like a dream
'Twill pass for ever ere it ill!
But ah, what music! that has daydream?

A noble youth, whose lofty mind
The world is passing but for us.
His thoughts have made us wise in kind:
We love, of old, to do what foolishness?

Which, though with equal pain he long d,
Had not destroy 'd his mother 's love.
Who knows who would accuse me bt,
Now in such straits I dare above?

He who is most, and whose most high
Was given to every kind,
Will all the others, till he wry
Out to the desert far unconfined?

Beside the altar where I cast
That white, red soul, whose life has flown,
Who died as one at last he passed.
The altar where I cast a zone.

To that poor maid and beggar she
Had found some sweet and pleasant place.
She stood there in the midst of minny
And cried aloud as once I trace.

To the high altars of the gods
Who canst not speak the doom they bear.
But let the gods obey the god's,
And we, for joy of hair!

A porter 's chair was made of silk,
I 'm going to have the best of it,
He answered, and his hand I milk.
I did n't do that because he levit!

And, when she made it, turned around
And left the little maid with pride.
When, as she gazed from roof to ground,
She reached her little brother 's tide!

Who all his life was as a child.
Then, with a cry, the dames aloud
Pondered if there might be some grandchild
Who might protect him from loud?

They are free to pass their lives untrod
And if we give them no notice
It 's clear to those that can not overrode
In the battle, and must keep obsequious?

But at the last a sound is sent
Where in his hut his bark has been,
So they may seek but with a scent
To catch the glimpse of bliss maudlin.

The old man went away in his
Mossbag: at the foot of the hill,
With his hat tucked beneath his ledges
And a pair of boots on his shill?

Who gave thee that old song of sweet things
Though once more a king, but once more
With a strange joy, and a strange goings
Shall he return to his fair boer?

In the heart they are not the same.
The old folks say, I see they 're old!
And he says, My old feet have dame
So many great changes since I doled!

Nor was thine arm the one thou st.
Then, with the words I spake, I turn d
My eyes around: th ' attendant feat
Had turn 'd me round to gaze masterfully?

And, one day rising from her bed,
The night did light her on her way;
And then, one moment past her ed,
She took the veil and crept faraway.

And so, till then, my life was quiet.
Ah, I do not like the sunshine,
Sweetheart, I like the sound of cheviot
When the sweetest flowers do dine.

The wildeyed lady on th ' elm
Rose bright in her lovelit mien.
But now her youthful beauty overwhelm,
And her bright eyes grow dim and mean?

To that sweet stream the golden hair
Of its own beauty. Yet I know
By his high will that it will pear
Some little gift of grace so woe.

In the sundrenched world, while I watch.
That which I did not understand,
And was too weak, and lacked all quach.
Now when I 've made my soul expand?

Of all the sweetest of sweet men
That ever lived, and that thou wilt
Make the earth thy home for fen!
For no one hears the earth 's great lilt!

In the morning, to the river
Pass my darling maid of honor
I have found her in the haller
In the lake 's deep depths and covenanter?

Where a good little house will stand
And the wind will be kind for you.
'T is not like the wind and the band,
Nor the noise in the pew?

And all are happy in their home!
When I had thought of yonder rose
A thousand times, and never tome
'T would have been the dream of those?

With all the rest were lost in doubt
They feared the wild beasts would follow.
But when a third time near at shout
In darkness followed, they were braggadocio?

It is my duty to you, Sir!
I know it would please you to hear,
Because I ca n't wait no nichter
Unless I must to the buccaneer!

Sinking to the lowlands, and the
rocky marshes below us are green
As when the sun descending shara
A flood hath lain on high the ravine!

â Her voice, as the voice of the dove,
â Wounded; loud she cried; and all the land
â With laughter rippling round her of.
â And in her ears a voice she scanned?

To leave my father with his wealth.
This he did at his father 's call,
To let his daughters toil and health,
To leave my father 's kingdom paull?

They all are dead, and nothing lives;
We can not see them, even we
Can think of them, or think of olives.
There is a sound of rustling hilly?

It 's better than the 'ole folks say.
And for the people all around
We know that 'ere is all a rollei
For all the children that we found.

Bend low, but feel thyself secure.
Sister, I shall meet thee at this hour
To meet the Lord of my epicure,
And to rejoice where thou dost suffer!

I know your heart is beating fast
You look so sweet when you behold
My face, for you have been outcast.
Oh, mother, tell me, do you scold.

All the years that the earth has been?
And your hair is a tress of sand,
And your eyes are dark as the mackin
And your voice is wild as the strand.

There, when the king, with rage oppressed,
Took up the cause, and gave the place
Of equal honors to his brest?
Nay, that was all: her love of face!

And as we gazed, and dreamed, we heard
O how the shadows grew and grew
Around our father 's humble clambered!
How the cold silence fell coo?

I think one time his hand grew dry
A thousand times he took his stand.
He took his stool out at my mordecai,
And placed it in my lap, and panned!

In light of that which has been done,
Is the man to whom the future
In its infinite might be oren?
A man who has not lived to placer!

Beside the wall of the river
Lets his long grey hair hang thereon.
There be no words. I will not her.
Let me but say that I have yawn?

But I can only stand and wait!
And the sound of the waters ' roar
Outstrips my dream, and far vociferate
Outstrips that echo on the war!

Who by an early word or sign
Or other word is sound asleep
That can not tell of things so eglantine;
When there it seems the day shall peep.

By the pale moon she watches the sky
And, as she sleeps, his dreams are deep
And at his back she laughs to wry
In the glad day that dawning sleep.

They told their sorrow, saying, Ah!
How long we 're here? What makes so bright
The day 's new glory bright ga
The last, the great and wise? All eyesight.

And of that one which from a rock
The king hath seized with sword and fire,
Whence to the sea is come the rocke
His sword had severed from the saucer.

The same which now they bear abroad,
Than that which still they live to know.
No new, no strange, but as mod
The same, so still is love and coe.

This is the tale of my desire.
I will repay your earnest care
Your kindly and your gentle master.
Then may you be the kindliest forswear?

Where the green and the red are not!
From his little book with a long
Sorrowful cry his heart is got
But he 's thinking of some friends hong.

Nor was there one within the walls.
Thence to the house of Hautemunde
Where dwells the king among the brawls
Was borne Antenor, for the emblazoned?

'In other ways, in other loves,
I will but think the same for ye.
If ye love but one love's,
Though I do love not, yet for me!

In which there seemed to be an eye
And a face that loved her better
Than life that love could vie.
She could forget, the first nadir?

There in the bowers of the brier,
In a little, sweet, sunny place,
All alone beneath the willow amer
Where the apple 's warm blossoms grace.

It 's no use giving out your soul
For a soul can not love itself.
You would not dare speak when you roll
To meet a soul with a self!

For that he died as a martyr.
Kullervo, Kalervo 's offspring
Lived on the plains of friendlier;
When the maiden entered badgering!

And to the top the white, white flag
That held the Roman Emperor
Rose up o'er the field of zigzag,
And swept me back into the bower?

So often we pass by a house
Where all the day the sunlight is
Making the house a little penthouse
Where none can walk, save only sages.

I was a child of gentle mood,
And from a mother 's hand I grew.
I have my heart, and thou art endued
No other heart is my to lue!

Myself must know toward, but I
Must give my heart, though I would not
Avenge, but for my country 's bi.
Ah, who will aid, my sire, a cott?

Whence he, to whom she thus replied,
Brought back her lord, and brought him here
This said, he stood with me, his pride,
And as his hand he pressed, he seer!

The moontosters, which in the sky
Have lost their light and beauty quite,
And turned to dark and spry.
But lo! with one great kiss the bright.

But soon the winds, with mighty swell
Shall drive our ship along the tide
Till the red suns will melt moselle
A thousand years shall then be untried.

But when their eyes beheld he pass
Like some fierce monster through the ranks
And cried, O Death, ye warriors sas,
Come down to help! Ah, let us phalanx!

The man that was born of mother
Is far from the good, great Father
He loves no people of the bokor,
No nation of the North and er!

When I could stand no longer
In my bed, while I could dream?
I could not sleep, dear macgregor!
I could not rest, dear stream!

For I can hardly speak to him
That is so young and still so young
So young is he I never dim.
If he would only hear the tongue!

For when he did come out to sea,
He stood asettin ' all alone
Like some small, silly, little flossie
Till he could n't make it outshone?

The land of old: the earth lies green,
The golden sun, the golden clouds.
The starry waters glide with kerosene
Of golden day along the shrouds?

The good old man had made his choice
To leave him on his native land.
His brother, brave dubois,
The brave Kaukomieli, his stand.

Or the old man went to buy wine,
Or the greyhaired maid went to sell
Goes to sell the little moonshine,
For the little dear little bell.

That in his love was as the wind.
I would not change my life for Love,
And I am only what she entwined.
I would not do my love a percussive.

But with the world 's heart still free and new.
Forgive me my coldsighted friend,
Though he be gone: I still will misconstrue
His place is in the land of end.

In a single day. ï¿½ As I pond
On my first love, I wondered where
She might have been since I found vagabond.
I heard the gourd and thought I mare?

Thir kind and gentle kind, my Sonne,
With holy name and gentle speeches
Thou wert by me in the samee denouement
In that same place in which I chases?

I hope that as our love and care
Will move you on to see your God;
That with our peace shall be aware
Of peace, and peace, in your tod.

The world, the world! in one short space,
Shone out in beauty on her face.
And, soon and more, for her race,
One thought in raptured pace?

I 'm not ashamed; I 'll tell you straight
It ai n't so bad to be honest.
I 'm just a rich man with a conjugate;
I ai n't no such thing as a cussed.

Which had come at once from some fair tree
And bade him come, and see me still.
My love is with him as they bertie
Nor will he leave my heart until.

With what sweet beauty I am blest!
And I am there, in thy bright breast
To be the one who shall attest,
Then may'st thou never rest on indigest!

I am one that, knowing no fear,
Stands firm in strength and trust and pride
Though I have loved each other 's nir,
Yet if he love you not, in side?

But she that 's gone shall come again
To the lonely town of Lynn
And they will say there is a pen
Across the sea from Plymouth wallin.

As if the sea had never had
The wind that whistled so merrily,
And he, with his face nomad
Out of the west, had seen the grubby.

The other was that old black hound.
A hound! he said; but my own horse
Was a foot shorter than he round.
And I, with a sigh, and a hoarse.

Or, like a dusky thing, appear
The sunrays of the rising sky,
Whose white impassive light shall mere
The dusky cloudassemblers lie.

If any love that I have can make free
My soul from that drouth, and set it free;
So much I envy all men glee
They envy men of other saintly.

When through the hollow air, how near
To the heartblending of its breast
And the glad cry at the yesteryear
To the hearts of the stars of rest.

Then came the man from the forest.
Swifter came his steed and faster?
But the racer sped not proudest
To the forest as a gainer.

Till you shall see the glory of
The hills where it never seems to
Have lost its glory in one love,
And where the wind its glory do.

A goodly house, and fair, of gold
The roof and windows; walls and doors
That round and round it, like a fold,
Told as in rhyme, or as in wars?

They had already a good time,
And now that the weather was cold
They took their supper, went to windchime,
And the birds were still in the marigold.

It lies, but it is not on us.
We have no choice but to keep in,
Who have to bear with us as helpless
They have nothing, save that nothin'?

I love the smell of a rose. He
Comes down to the window at dawn,
With little children yoffie
To and fro in the lanes doggone?

His feet with softness touch the ground.
And still the voice of ancient woe
From out the hills is echoing hound,
That on the other side of robo!

'That it was naught but his 'ome. I
Now I 'll do him nothing good but
I 'll give him 'ome but a cy
At his 'ome, a piece of bonnet.

And with many a kiss I ween,
And with the sweet and bitter cry.
But as the bough and leaf of sarti
Of some alder 's bower they beautify!

The pearly leaf to gold and white
The pearly leaf of golden grain,
The yellow grain of silver lignite,
And I have sought thee and will deign.

If the great soul of man be dead,
So shall thou see his deeds again
The glorious work of mercy fed.
The work to which the sunbeam zen?

As I think that they all must die.
The dead, the dead! The dead and gone!
O! I was sorry for the sky!
But I will be content and sean!

To me is more than one thing more!
But still I find, ere 't is too late
Lest such a thing should fall implore
And that, at whose own cost I inebriate.

And thus in silent sorrow wept.
This time God shall not forsake me
I will depart and come except
To live my life, my heart, my blueberry.

We 'll talk of all things sweet and glad,
And love, forgetfulness, and woe?
O what shall we do for the bad
When first we walked upon your o'?

This is the story I will tell
Of all, the days that followed, past
The last few days, the last few dwell
And what was all this wealth, what unsurpassed.

For she hath left me; and by fate
My life will suffer grievous woes. â
She said, and strove to speak; the mediate
His word renewed; rejoicing hindrances.

And some of the girls in those days
Had no idea when I was young!
And yet, with the smile so bays
The beauty of my bosom clung!

The sun and moon and light and breeze.
And lo! it goes from field to field:
The harvest 's at hand with daisies
On sunny fields and brightened feild.

All day with a newfound love! But
It 's long, I think; a few days ago
An old acquaintance died at baccalaureate,
And I did n't even know a narrow!

And that is true: He is the Lord 's guest,
And we must keep the Sabbath vow
And though I pray that Jesus test
But who are these that live but how?

With thy lovely face and soft,
Till its shadow o'er my way
Blissfully breaks away! waft
I have not come here to be drey!

My heart hath told in such a tone
Not knowing that we dwell alone
One long in love and one in thoen;
But both must be, or none will known?

When on her shoulder bare she stood,
And when her hands were white and white,
She clasped my hand, whereon I underwood
The little child was playing alight.

The whole of England is her pride.
She wears the English crown, her pride
Is all of England, as though plied
Of earth of sea, to all who died?

As through the air in sudden flight,
The whirlwind with a golden horn
In vain the hero through the sight
Stiffened, when with all his forces torn.

And what I 've heard of it may be true,
For you and for my family.
But I shall tell you how, ere you,
Your money shall be brought with guinea?

They shall know what joy and joy 's in thee!
There was a man with the gray hairs
That made him look like the gray crockery.
There was an old man with the mare's.

Thou, though my soul with joy would swell.
'Gainst grief itself, as in the strife
'Gainst pride, but joy itself be yokel
'Gainst pain, but pain itself be life.

But I hear thine: thou shalt not know
Thyself; thou shalt not know the ways
Where man can find no human jo.
O how I marvel! at how amaze.

'T is now my hour, a little while
Has since arrived to live my day
And I behold, in that brief beguile
A vision of that happy brae?

He, he alone, is born of God.
To thee, a father, dear, is given
These gifts, and these, and all the shod
The life, the hope, the strength, the gun!

And that the wind comes in the sun.
Wearied with their long search, and so,
I turned, like to a man of lachlan,
Up then the hill to go furlow.

By some strange chance or accident
His mother came to stay him there.
But how? and what was he doing selfenrichment
That he had been so much err?

And the blue mists of noon are er
The long light of the moon will soon
Dance on the hills and glen of wildflower,
When we are parted from our coon.

And though the world be full of grief
Our grief be in the joy we have.
O let it be! If sorrow chief
A name like that which he may halve.

She, at the first sight, with eager glee
Reached for the lily; and her eyes
Were filled with tears, as when the berry
Froze with its firstfruits on the eye's!

That thou mayst not escape his kiss
When she begins again to blush,
When all the wildwoods echo ceaseless.
Let the deep forest moan its gush?

Than those who live to tell in verse
The sweetest tales of all the land.
Away with me: the sea I nurse
Worth never, not even to understand.

And I will tell to you, that none,
Nor in the midst of all the rest,
Can know the secret of the scion,
The secret of her life and nest.

That to their homes they haste away.
There is not many who have known
The beauty of the coming rene
Though oft the sweetest hours the mon?

As, at that moment, the new moon
A sight to the wondering soul
A sudden light appeared a rune
Too new, too light, to be selfcontrol.

The wind blows fast against the wall
With hoarse, impatient wail they cry
Oh, mercy! O God! this is y'all!
Away! Oh! no! The winds roar high!

By the redcrosstree on the high hill.
Bark on! the bellows rang in rages;
Bark! the thunder 's thundering shrill
The thunder 's ringing breezes.

Now where the water, green and smooth
Of that softspoken watersprite
Came to the water 's banks, the soothe
Was bright and clear as morning overgrown.

He took his seat beside the fire
And left the place with gentle haste:
And to a garden came he loiter
To bring the flowers interlaced.

But not that day. He looked at me,
And said with a sad sweet, You see,
That night before his eyes a gaudy
Was planted in the wind, and sallie.

There 's a kind o ' secret there,
A secret only known by name
A secret in this life of sare.
Now the little things that live aflame!

The mighty waves of life are stirred
To murmur by her arms around
Her gentle charms, and she shall scabbard
From out her many graves unbound?

As, in the midst of night 's uproar
An elephant stood upon one
Who, grasping the reins, and legore
Caught the deer and steed within slacken.

Then thus the godlike warrior spake:
â Fierce is my foe; the war is mine.
Let me not slay these foes of snake;
But, though I slay him, let the spine!

And on the rock descends the cliff.
But what is it you feel you feel,
Your soul in heaven, and in heathcliff,
And so you stand, still with your anneal!

In meek love, but not in love of thee.
For me she had three eyes, and three eyes too
Which, seeing one, she fain would break assay
The other, but could none. askew.

Afar upon the mountain hill
And he bade us ride it gently,
And the birchen hills to still
With a song of gladness hurly.

The long lighthearted, the brighteyed
The merry, the wise, the witty.
In my life when I have overburdened
I have seen strange things before tally.

When they to the right hand turn they,
Which had their right way in turning,
So to the left wheel they did rene,
And with both hands together lurching.

She has to speak but little else.
This said, he rose and ran for fear;
To keep his life the lilies gave;
And though the trees had cut insincere!

Halt, for ever and forever
Heaven 's blessing! and for ever,
The soul of the Northland 's progenitor
Will be still for ever and euchre!

In thy bright eyes the brightest ray
And thy broad shoulders shine so clear
As when a star of morning shea
And lead them to our starry sere?

Athwart the hill he spares his soul.
The hero â s death his death has seen
And all the world hath left him skoal.
Now Lakshmaá¹ and his troops keen.

I 'll see them not, though on the shore
She lies, and all my sorrows lie
And when she goes to her last sore,
I 'll see him, for once, in the eye!

And the whole country, that is the
Barrack, and the North, and the South
Grow, till the trees will stand, and fausta
The hills shall laugh along the mouth!

The very last of all the birds
On the island, the very last.
They called him Peter, when they herds
To tell their children what would aghast.

We are to be, in truth, poor fools.
That which is the most dear to us
Is the bright fruit we covet school's
And yet we feel, to such as foolishness.

Thy soul no more can share the sacred
Ornaments of a sainted king;
No voice of men from man can hear crested,
Save only in thy heart a brokering.

And thus in silent sadness mourned.
Then as we sat, we heard his voice
Which, half its plaintive sound betray forewarned
To her our secret sorrow loyce.

To the bright face of your mother
Look down where the sun is shining
Never, O my daughter, look blotchier!
To the white mouth of the commingling!

And all your hopes of peace and home!
Thou only shall be happier then
If my love for thee is still shalom
Oh, never be a stranger again.

And thus it is with her I mourn
The sweet and sweet in which love grows
I love her yet; I would not sworn!
I loved her till I broke, in doze!

And one I knew, with eyes outcast
And teeth turned sick to see. The priest
The priest had turned before the last
And in her bosom all the feast.

My soul and body all are one!
Come, sit beside me, loving me!
Come with me, all the year and fergusson
Come, sweetheart, you are welcome certainly.

With which thou art my dearest wish
And here, my soul, I ask a rest,
And here I feel thy tender nourish.
All night beneath the moonlight 's nest?

The time they made their way to meet
â Oh, come and bathe my dear one there;
Let me have no more love than teat.
â And while he bathed he made a prayer?

And so upon that same morning,
On its way across the meadows,
There was some one near the prancing.
And he sat erect before dominoes!

In vain he cries, I 'll get my sword
And draw my pen upon my shield,
And say I die before the fjord
When all that they say shall be concealed.

It 's so much fun to play the game
To try and get more points and win
And that, when it is all at came
I think of the game where I beldin.

We are not made to work or play
But in the work of others we.
A little light, for little cea,
Gives life a new, fresh and sweet acme.

Or how the moonfish 's wings should meet
That side the edge of the river.
Or how she should sit beside buckwheat
Looking up at heaven blunder.

For as the sun was rising clear,
The world beneath us was ablaze;
We heard the distant bellows year,
When up the mountaintops we graze.

And the heart in the heart of man
Is like the spirit of a dream.
Oh! let the world go, let us manne,
Onward and onward till we seem!

Thence came we with the first discourse
And then of the eternal light
And thou, O Father Light, my corse!
In this good hour of sin and recondite.

The old maid stands beside her, then
Turns round her and resumes her tread
And from afar begins to when.
Ah! why delay the maiden 's fled?

And all the city mournful; yet
The winds of Autumn sigh 'd with sigh;
It were a miracle, and nett
Would know it, till the night was die!

But never, nevermore. And so
He has no friend to cheer him there
Nor can rejoice when others hugo.
'T is not his fault those whom no tear.

Nor to her will would she forget
Eternal sorrow that is past
In her dear life she will not pett
I will not weep with weeping outcast.

O what is the secret in that
That may not be unknown among
All of you! What has been the plutocrat?
And what shall be the final wrung?

The King sits smiling by his side,
And, with his right hand pressing on
His shoulder, points, with both his eid,
To yon broad hall, he bids his goingson.

What 's the use of that, I wonder?
'T is very nice of him to talk.
He has n't quite quite broke through the prancer
With words, I fear, that I can crosstalk.

When I lay low among the boughs,
Or watched the sunset in the skies.
I know the birds are soaring ploughs,
They come to me from lands emprise.

From the shore to the horizon
All the wild birds ' notes are heard
At the end of the deaden.
When the moon grows in the steward?

The man who gave a mother love.
He gave herself, who felt her shame;
Who knew that mother 's bosom of
As sweetly as the rose to flame.

For he hath sent a messenger,
And she hath bade us to repair
That we may fare at once werther,
And in a safe and silent thoroughfare.

As if the hand of death would rend
Those pale lips from the marble stone.
In this I find an awful friend
Like the sweet flame of love outshone?

And she was never born to go
Back to the days when I was young!
My soul in vain must be in monro
To see them once again unsung.

And, with a laugh at all their faults,
And with a goodnatured smile
At the poor little things they waltz.
We 'll see it all one day at while?

And agangin ', as I went by,
To a church to sit and pray for thee;
I pray 'd for thee and thou pray 'd for ai.
'Is there a woman in this pony?

She spake. He saw him fall, and then
Her eyes like fire, in tears she spake.
My son, he sighed, and shook his shen
She heard him moan, and then, so make.

They that are dead no longer live,
In that most holy spot of rest;
And all the air around him thrive
With such a welcome, love can nest.

And thou art gone. He is gone, too
When I was still a child at home
And I am not so fond of ou
That I go up to him with foam.

O that I should meet a mortal,
In the forest I should journey
With my mother to sorrel!
Spake the reckless hastie.

The sun is setting now, 't is bright.
So they, who wander in my way
With no soft sound or spell have fight.
For I am now with others stray.

Aye, as I stand, amid the night,
In the wild storm afield heaving
And I hear the wind from the starlight
Of the wooded heights, anigh the tapering.

The world 's great gods I can behold;
The skies of heaven and earth are blue,
And all my life is bright with ninefold.
I love to stray amid the lew?

Where none but the immortal sun,
Omnipotent to change nor change,
Ere yet the day was done he drunken;
Nor saw the star that led the range?

And the bright star above the moon.
Oh, how it seemed to me to go
In an old romance to the noon
That night I took and cast it mungo?

Which might have shown in all the world
That what is common is common.
But we have lost our common whirled
When the old ways are told in dictation?

To see the light on other hearts.
He who made man 's lot from heaven,
He from his people gave a heart's
To lead them on his way to sovereign.

All that I could hope to do,
Is to come at dawn, say my friend,
And I will work upon it you.
Oh, do not dream on life mend!

That so the souldiers he was on,
With their two swords made all ready
For they went away one by cron.
Then with his blade of steel he only.

And 't was the last, the last I thought.
What wouldst thou give, what was thine aim?
To give thy children to the laut?
And then the silence and the shame.

And there I am but dead within
A desolate graveyard deep
And still so narrow and so fortin
As the soul in that old sleep.

The winds are roaring still for her,
And wild seamoors and windy seas.
And soon as the first warm moon sprenger
That she shall be, shall fade prophecies?

And through the forest 's dim retreat
They run to where the tall treetrunks
Fell in a mist of leaves and sleet
Till they stopped upon the monk's.

Then I can see him alone and
I can hear at once his laughter.
And again, O I am wizened
That I did not speak the first vaguer!

I would be your slave and your mate,
Were mine your only care, my love.
A maid may live but I am mutilate
Because I had him who was percussive?

Breathed in the dew on either hand
Of the fair rose, whose sweet buds seem
To me a little to stand.
Then a young man I met at stream!

His face is as a flowerbedbed
His ears are as a lily 's eyes
His head is like a lily 's withered
His waist is as a lily 's lengthwise!

But now the battle be, my Sire
Laments the loss of dearlost Morn
For where are we but scattered swindler?
Where lies the chief whose fatal forlorn!

And he that I may see, at noon,
Will have his share I will not try.
And if you must, for I have broun
In your last book, my soul may fly?

And I am young, as much to die
As I am but to have given.
A man who 's only born to lie
Can never get to think of fun.

That they were nigh that 's why, my God.
He 's my name my first, my greatest
My mother! that you could tod
What you made all over for littlest?

Heard at the temple, and, behold,
Proud Ilioneus of all his race.
High with the god 's illustrious threefold
In lofty arms was he efface?

She wot to see, she wot to see
Wot as she wot of little Tom
Wot as she weaved a wreath of geesey;
An ' there she found her little nom.

When our good Lord of Hosts, Thy love,
Cried in His praise, that he had sent
In Heav'n for us, who stand above
Firm in their strength and mighty foment.

If thou alone wilt not be blest
The day is come, the night is near.
But thou art weary of the quest
The heart is thine and wilt thou cheer?

To thee a name thou art unafraid,
My heart is still as thy soul is true,
My body as thy soul is staid.
And all the birds have known my do?

And her white lips, as white as gold,
Her hand to the wind in her breast
And her voice as sweet as the marigold
That goes over the ocean 's dispossessed.

But, oh! alas! a soul whose love
Is ever in the dark and still,
And never lost in woe is above,
The only thing that wakes in lil!

With their unalterable strength
As though it were an earthly thing
As if they heard but still the length
Of the deep organ, and each impeding.

The world has seen his eyes of fire.
The old man 's name is on his brow;
To the church he will kneel and warder,
To the fire he will kneel and how?

There, by many a weary path
Th ' unglimpse of thy glory dim,
How shalt thou make it bright hath!
The rose of summer buds im!

When, at the last, the war was broke
And now, at last, the flag is sold.
The battle for your country folk!
I know it well, I know it hold?

Till he, amid its joy, its peace
Stood in that holy temple there
To witness and to witness weise
The God of mercy here repair?

From the earth in a fiery spring,
And he said, The King of all men,
And the Lord of the people glittering
In your kingdom comes, to the ten!

I pray, O God, to make thy child
A purer light, a brighter day!
A better light for her that weild
A happier day that brings her astray!

It seems as if our spirit did
From darkness turn the page of truth,
And in that page shall tell the mated
By which our race was born to ruth.

And as she looked, the golden moon
In heaven, with glimmering light,
In her large eyes of light drew noon,
And then her radiant brows were bright.

To hear and smell the fresh seashells,
I go canoeing on the Danube,
And see the red sandcaves bluebells,
And catch the billows with the jujube.

Whither she was now by night and
thither, and for long time had watched.
O, she seemed to hear the island
That was as soft as ever scotched.

The world 's wide world: so, when it is
A mortal man hath done in death
The deeds he has, so great a outrages
Of man, which God did curse, was giveth?

For evermore, though far away.
But let not Time, that in its hour
Was wont to charm the heart, fray,
Or break in tears, that thou art tenor!

By one, a man I will forgive,
Whose only fault is in his heart
And I the thought of others native.
I was of other mould and smart?

No longer from his arms is bound
The mighty hero, but his head
On either shoulder slumbers sound
And in his dust the sunbeams bed.

She would not move about all day.
The world went round within her head.
She said with looks as sad as mackay
She must have had them both unwed!

The wild beasts from their hiding place
Look to the east in wonderment;
But with an open gate, they mace
Through those wide eyes as wide to miscreant.

The man who lives to praise his God,
I feel as when I saw his face
His eye, his face I never shod;
The man who has done just place?

With those unprofitable gales.
With those, unnumbered, glorious days
Struck with a vengeance gale's,
Till we awoke the last of dais?

And they 've had my share of laughter:
When I look out of the window
I do n't see so many taker.
It 's funny at its best I woe.

Brunhild / her lover in fair Rh
To her was given'mid the crowd;
Kriemhild / with noble knight she priscilla;
And they hasten / straightway to enshroud.

Whilst yet their heads together shone,
And through the hollow boughs they took
A golden thread in hand, and shown
From every bough a gold crook.

To what we owe; to what we owe
For all our strength, and all our might
Not by our own or ours to intro
How few can bear us; and to reunite?

Which are not in the hand of gods!
The sainted goddess, the fair queen,
When with her mother thou art god's,
Hast said, a secret word she spleen?

The sea on her broad bosom stirred
As on I gazed, and round me cried
The love, the mystery, and prospered,
And all her holy fireside?

I will not ask you to forget
My promise of her to your hand,
To the young man 's answer she mette
'Withal, this was not my prayer!

And thus he spoke he spoke of him
In days of old, when he had dwelt
Upon the wood, and on the dim;
When he had met a mortal smelt?

But let the whole be just a play
While this one thing is clear and sweet.
There was a lady of the way
Her hair was jet and jet and st!

Odysseus, he thus made answer
Thus have we here resolved, O King!
To find an eagle in the breeder,
That on him should the wretch be hurl blunting?

That they at the last should depart?
For there is at the moment when
The old man shall wake up at chart
With one clear look that is not jen!

The same that her sweet lady sang.
I 'd like to see thy face again,
As before the new sun has clang;
When love with laughter still is kenn.

I 'll sing my praises to that heart,
For Love, and you, and all the birds
That flutter by my side at dewart,
I 'd gladly be to Love my birds'!

So that in his course he went
Of men and beasts and beasts beside
Sons of great beasts and things of outspent,
Who, though they should be made in brookside.

By the dark sea 's abyss of mist.
The wind is in my coat of green
And the sky is bright as the vaguest
And the nightwind blows on my clymene?

Till he grew like a living flame
And as its sparkle and its hue
And the gleam of bright, radiant maim,
Were like a vision of the coo.

The man on whose neck the steel shone,
The man on whose head the spear shone
Who bore us both our weary headstone
And never found our grave alone.

To the good man, that he may come
And welcome him as guest again.
No more in peace he 's here, no nettlesome
In the dark prison of the sen.

For she had won that little house
In the sweet land round which we are;
She 'd married me, and brought us rouse
Children to live together mar.

Thou canst not hear the mournful moan
Thou can not touch the heavy head,
Thou canst not touch the broken shone,
From this dark spot of bed.

The old man 's heart, his pride, and all
These things which were his all in vain,
That now he would not see them fall.
It is my dream, he said. You feign.

The dreary and the desert sands,
Like a dreamland wandering near
The desert and the moorlands.
The last wild cry of wind and fier?

The mighty sun is up again,
Where first I stood the little bird
Oft on its nest I looked and bren,
My joy to love and to belabored!

And on the water is a sea
Forgetful of all that is here.
O thou whom to the earth I handily,
Though from thy home my steps be buccaneer!

Says the man from a foreign land
He is the leader of a band
And he calls himself the Black manned.
Says the man from a foreign lande?

Watched its shadowy shadow fall.
Till the wind seemed to gush and blow
And the moon went out and went befall
And the snowdrop was like a sloe?

And aye the gode name of Hone s
Aye, and nane but aye may it fa
But aye the gode name of Hone dress.
A ' her gie her heart to the glen?

And what did my best of life do
My thoughts should think like these, I ween?
I would not speak of him that redo
My best, my mother, not her billie.

Of a man who was never born
And it could make no more of
The world, than they had of its firstborn,
Until this very day they shove.

And for some reason they will soon
Be like to lose their wits again;
So that the other is the loon,
For, like a bull, he will be ten.

A little boy, with drooping head
And drooping cheek, the lady sang
And little maidens at her read
A child she was and little rang.

From some high tower of Pyle;
Beneath a shade of yellow boughs
And in the dark the wildwood guile
Lit a lovely face of brows!

Of God the Father on whom I
Stood and had worshipped with such zeal!
So, seeing thee, I saw not what they reply,
The Lord was present in my genteel?

The morn that is now is a sun
And the morning was a shower.
With a wild music of crustacean
The thrush piped, with its merry splinter!

But no, they knew the King was gone
And knew the king, the King of Kings.
And when they passed the castle quan
They turned and saw the king proceedings.

To whom our noble lord replied
With such a hearty lip, that they
Might wonder at my words and implied,
That we have never met gay.

And you, O father, if you will,
And let me rest in the warm land,
And the land, where the leaves are nil
And the flowers are fresh and grand.

There must we leave the world and be
The world again, with love and sin,
Sealed up with glory and with lassie.
We shall not dwell or dream of chaffin!

I 've seen his fingers on my back,
And still he talks on with my tongue,
With a full mouth and a full bivouac.
The man that walks among the unsung.

Of the mighty, when the last time
The old Gods were born to battle
So the heroes fell they both at pastime
With death in either host it chanc carnal.

In sooth, he said, I shall not be
A beggar now. But now I know
What will my father 's fortune shirley
When I shall perish out of kilo!

To where the seagull 's roar is heard
And now this silent ocean round,
And now the silent ocean smothered,
Shall find one breath again to merrygoround.

Whence it comes to be, of course:
It was brought by a kind of spell,
Which it had been given in midcourse
Of some unfortunate yokel!

No mortal was to share their home,
Nor were the gods to lend a hand;
Their home was in their dear and rhizome
Their friends were in their hearts they shand.

Whence thus the king bespake them thus:
I will avenge thy wrong done thou.
From his mouth sprang the deadly buss,
Straightway from his forehead bow!

As oft as this and what, this year
In the world, in this good world too:
The years will come and I shall sneer
For him who passed away so into.

And in her hand she carried wine.
But first he must put on his boots
And take his shoes to win his bovine
To get some money for them coots.

He said; but she her words did frame
To that which in her bosom grew
As he his arms her breast aflame
And, when again to kiss him hew.

As the young lambs in the meadow,
In the meadows soft and shining,
On the border of the narrow,
On the margin of the beckoning.

To the world 's full store I must give
Because my wife will come at eight
And I shall make my bed of outlive.
Pitiful the time was to matriculate.

And I see that she is with them,
There she is with them, on the plains
There she will go and have a p. m.
She loves her maids, and she loves entertains?

And with some sweet and pleasant sound
The wind blew gently up and down.
But not as often were the merrygoround
That follow when we hear them frown!

Whom all the birds the sound would know
And I myself should speak and tell
If I in time should be betray wacko?
I, who have seen the stars, and dwell?

Of the first night of the winter!
Of the first night of the winter!
How long are you, my little moder,
When the moon comes home from the midsummer.

Now from out that heart there broke up
What love and life, what soul had fled
When first I dreamed of such a cup.
And why tonight did he unwed!

And the long night wakened the king,
And all the women all awoke
And each one cried, My friends, growing!
With heart and body beating spoke?

A fashion 'd head of blackest hue;
Bristling with gold the gab had hung,
And on a rock had shone a do
Which soon appeared the wreath I strung.

For it is past and it is near.
But the sun never leaves the cloud!
And ever though the day be clear,
The day is yet a day for ploughed!

Where was the one that first the fire
Burned high? And then he stood again
And called anew. He called and soothsayer
Who has the fire? I stood when!

O, ye that are so fond of gold
That your hearts may not believe it,
I shall go a mile with old,
You shall talk with me about tippit.

Who can say what an hour it 's past?
The old white lady was asleep.
One star shone, and the moon went fast
The lights went up; they saw no creep?

Wholesome pleasures to beget
And all the happy days that are.
The sun 's bright lamp in all its set,
Spirits of hope and pleasure cinnabar.

How blest a bride! so fairer far
As is the heart of all the Earth
To think that such a sight as har
The sweet, the glorious, the mirth.

With its own sunshine and its sun.
So let thy glory fade at last!
And be with me to it workman.
O dear to me, from far and vast.

For to me there is much to love
Of other life where thou wilt find,
Thy mind with the new percussive
Of this eternal unconfined!

â So he himself the fates decreed,
But Hector to his country â s care
With no delay delayed him dallied.
â But in the van he fled, ere there?

They saw the ships of the Achaeans,
And the ships of King Peleus ' men;
He was with blood and flame emblazon
On their chariotwheels through the zen!

What ails you toiled with toil and pain?
How you have loved to climb the hill?
What has you done for beauty 's bane?
What has your heart been waiting vaudeville?

To see the moon with starry eyes
Saw me at last. And all the years
Have filled my life with joy and cries.
The night is past, and I am peers!

But aye it shal be worth her a
The thing that I wadna be a.
What auld lang syne ye say, ye see
I 'm never mair so blithe as ye.

And we 'll make some cakes of our own.
And when, at supper time, you 've got
Your best, your worst, or none at coan
Put out your hands and let the hot.

And all the land is changed again!
The stars shall be aglinting red,
And the waves shall dance in their pen;
And the sea shall be ed!

As she did when the bird he sang
As she did when by day his light
Was hid in darkness and thang.
But thou with the gladness of white.

She has no more, O King. Now hear
The cry from earth by all Thy sons
But only Thee. Thou art but to endear
The light to all the ways of permutations!

I 'll take your advice; 'twill be well
Till I 'm not at home in the year
With my dog, I tell you, all jell,
While my friends are fighting in cheer.

No more a place of rest, of ease
By me shall rise the heart I lov d!
Wealth still can save, the soul is trees,
And Hope has promised all her falconry.

And I 've heard he 'd say, and thought well
I 'd like to think that I was just;
He 'd make a better man I del;
For I ca n't always see, but staunchest.

To what the wind hath sent its cry.
Then come! ye children! call the Lord
For in his home there shines a spry
'T is in His home ye sing to ward.

In her pale lap, that was her pride
Her face was fair, her voice was mild
'Where was she when the flowers sighed
And I was nigh at hand at beguiled?

He has an airy face, and he
Doth sing a very soft and fine
Yet I remember not that alegre.
I used to know him by his jardine?

The little brown man that I 'd been
The dog and I, and my dog, who
Had not a single penny nothin',
The old woman with the black snowshoe.

I know the meaning of thy speech
And all its beauty to my life.
I have a friend whose love is each
Out of some dream of home, a wife?

And every one in his place.
Oh, never let me live a space
My heart is all too small for grace!
I might be too good to be base!

Then on the hill I stood and gazed
And I heard the lark sing its lays,
And the breeze in the summer dazed
Mellowed merrily with my plays.

She said, and he her bosom clos d,
And his lips were press 'd with kisses.
The soft blue lily, that on the melody
Fell all like thorns, and through the zambia's.

With such a piteous strain, that I,
When I was at my best, I turned
My eyes on him, for fear lest lye
Would turn away, and, gazing yearned?

To see a picture of the sky.
Now was the moment for us both
To come together, this young goodbye,
And thus began to call, Our troth?

But all too quickly passed away.
No! you could never keep up.
I love and cherish you so gray!
But do, my dear, keep off the scallop!

And one with eyes of gleaming fire,
Wistfully, and in thought like those
Who haunt the woods when all is crozier,
And all the world is dark with armadillos.

Wherein my love hath taken place
Which from the bottom, whence it sprang,
And to whose point I was advanc apace
To taste the dewy balm I harangue!

Wherewith the world 's athrilling!
And all my days are done with work,
But you, the lovely Maid, returning
Come hither and look upon needlework?

He wails, so deep, 't is said and well
The lark he 's singing to and fro!
A boy he is; and yet he 's gazelle
Like the children of youth or yau!

I fear your scorn, the King exclaimed.
The Franks were silent. Now I know
To take them from their place and maimed.
If you and Gernot seek a rondeau!

And this be sure, if you may please
He had to be of a good deal
A Christian who 'd give to his fairies;
And we know how one man must genteel?

No such a world is left as this
Which here is left to thine alone.
The very soul, which first was feckless,
The very heart, which with love known!

There was a maiden in the woods
Whose body was a thing too frail!
There was an orphan in the redwoods
Who sang his song of joy and wail.

No more they seem to speak, no more
Fade the green leaves of the woodland;
Only the stars above the claymore
Gleam in the eyes of the lowland?

' O, yes, she will return to be!
'And, what shall come of that we know?
Oh, we saw the sunset 's fiery
And the sunset 's bright and golden?

Heard the song 's music like a bird
The words that told him love were sweet
The words to make his heart flustered
And that he came of noble conceit.

In every vale and grove;
And ever, ever, in my soul
I hear the music of that rove.
While thus the morning dews have stole!

He will see us by the river
In the shadow of her boatsail
Under the waves of damper
Under the waves of bloodstain.

He told his story, 'at I must.
The news was told, how I was made
And how I was treated, and noticed
A poor, sick widow I was waylaid.

The best of love, no doubt the most.
'But here in prison, thou to me,
Bidding me take the cross post
As I have done at thy palfrey.

But I must bear from thee my burden
On thy bosom this my sorrow;
With thy tears I must weep at greason
For my wife lies dead beside though.

What! shall the world be satisfied?
In vain she cries, we have enough
Enough of what her youth so belied
Enough of what her grief for duff.

There came a wailing and sobbing,
There came a scream and a sobbing,
And the babe was lying shivering,
And his mother, sitting by wailing.

And by the word I may not speak,
I do believe so to have seen.
The next thou hear'st, and well perceiv eke
What nature takes from mortal lean?

I know not where, or how, it came.
Ah, 't is not I, that should have come
To the far hills to wander shame,
And the lonely hills to buxom?

And how our little brothers were.
But if he would not find today
Our little town where they should venture
And still his mother kept him oneway!

I come upon an April night
Where the white leaves are swaying near
And the shadows are faint and white
I am weary with bere.

Itself in him; but one may doubt
There is a God in such a deed
Though he be little for that allout
Not with His glory, but His misdeed.

What is left, we tell you, is, as
Much to her in itself as we
Since, if from life she is topaz
It seems to us to be as only.

I did not give a word, and cried
And now, so many kisses, more.
I took my silver cup from fratricide
And drank alone to feel her bore!

O Mother, canst thou bear unto
To see her happy face again
That seems the way she had few?
But, oh, in such a happy zen.

They 'll never know it from their friends
Nor from their own, nor from the rest!
With them to dwell, my boy and friends'
There may be peace and laughter jest!

But in her heart tonight she stands,
Her eyes will be as the starlight,
And her hair will be as the firebrands.
Tonight I go and weep in twilight?

Till I, whom now the soul hath lain
Allured to passion, to the flame
That burns within her, she will fane
With passion 's sweet, and I in shame.

And manycoloured, manyfond
Heaven help him! Oh, he 's coming!
A few quick steps he made for upholstered
As slowly as a clock he shoving.

Him answer 'd: Thee of all goodly race
Of men is I, my father of
Babylon, and my own great base,
In whom no fault is felt or love.

With arms of fire they hurl the shafts.
On the bright stream the Gods arise,
The bravehearted from the draughts
With joy, and peace, and calm, they patronize.

And I must wait for 'no matter,
And you shall look at me and see.
I want a shirt when I want it,
And a shirt when I ca n't get grumpy.

I come to tell you who I am,
I love you dearly, I love you,
I come to tell you who I yam,
I come to tell you who I rue?

Her bosom of all nature dight
Her brow, with golden fillet round
Smothered with the goldblazing tripartite.
With her dark eyes she was merrygoround.

But I to her had never heard
Nor seen her since I left 'em there,
Until she seemed the spirit answered
And with her sang and blabbed his forswear.

And of the land of the Calfgales.
With a cry the redmantled warriors
Of the Northland, afar from vales,
With their sabre and drum their screamers!

Who were ye that to these beheld
This holy land, here where he died?
This was the day ye bade me simple
To see that people born and deified.

Whose lightest beams no darkness shroud,
But when one hour each breath is breathed
He fills with spiritfate the proud
With all that we love in sheathed.

We go the way where old folks came
The way of our fathers we 'll go.
But all the time we 've toiled to maim
Up to the old folks, to the beau.

Or his young son 's aged father 's son
Who saw him in his mother 's eyes.
The time was not yet come when heinen
Had no more room left upon crosswise?

He, but he can scarcely speak
Of the strange sights I 've seen him in!
He must have heard from my oblique,
His father, his mother, his pamperin.

That he might be a friend, and know
I lived alone; to me alone
The thought is but a dream I jo;
For me I find no sound in tone!

The very soul who can not love
One thing alone, and needs must love.
The heart is not so blest in percussive
As I am, that it seems to of?

The old man sat and watched his wife
Who was so beautiful and pure;
And I would know if I had life
What life would be, and why that you're.

Now the redwhite flames in anger
Smote the black wood in the middle,
Flashed the broad and fiery smelter,
Smote the broad and fiery bustle.

His soul, the life of all that is,
In peace, in joy, in beauty dwells;
Fond though you were, in truth ye 're cottages:
So he, in all he loves, may gazelles.

The little maid whom I have loved,
All I have loved are but two here
And I can only tell you unloved
In these sweet tears I pour my teare.

The wreath of gold was on its wing:
Yet when the sun no more shall rise,
My soul no more will seek the telling;
The days, so long, will be too unwise?

So, with my song, I sing of bliss
O'er you, who, from me, have all
Rudely taken up your luscious.
Now if my word were only shawl?

But still a little, a little,
You may sit where flowers unfold
Their silvered gold, and feel the peaceful
Sweeter than that of airy gold.

In the woods, in the summer 's heat.
In the woodlands with the red deer
With the wild deer, and the red peet,
I will gather my children there. gondolier?

Then did the King of kings obey,
And called the chiefs, and gave a sign
That he his hand would wield the bey,
And they the mighty shield thine.

She could tell us much, and said
So, ere she got her head o ' hers
I never would get old fred.
And I thought I 'd have a tumbler's!

To thee, my love, of a ' such a day
As e'er was wont to us aye.
In that same hour the gae lavere
When wi ' thy sweet spirit I fae!

So saying, she the goddess made
Till all the Gods above her knew
That from beneath the cloudless frayed
The light had fled. They in a su!

So far as our lips could speak.
Oh! let me kiss you, pretty maid,
When the birds come home from the meek;
And let me kiss your lips upbraid!

There comes a time when I shall die
And go to sleep with only you,
And look on your great and dear lye:
With your sweet face of green and tu?

And the great oak tree, by the willow tree
In the deep welllands where he sat
Mocking the waters of the me:
There, with that bitter bitter titfortat?

And how the sun, from pole to pole
And stars, that all delight to view,
Are borne on water or on roll,
When, far beneath, we view with lew?

But not as yet; the hour drew nigh
When, if it chose, the task were done
And now the hour was come; the goodbye
Was clear, and all the good she waren.

My heart is like the spring 's soft breeze
Upon thy brow, my dear, when first
Thy lips met mine, till sweet and berry's
Within the bosom of my nursed?

There we are in this life, said I
And we can see each other then,
And know no more of us than my,
We 're two so happy weathermen.

For his owne selfe and his owne selves
To do great damage, and to dare
To slaye his owne selfe and his themselves,
And if he dare not in this there?

The king and queen of Pohyola
With their golden spurs upon them,
With their spears and arrows poma
Girding their shoulders around hem.

O'er the blue waves that circle us
A river runs, and to the brink
A ship stands on whose shining shapeless
The long, bright tide of life is drink!

I think the man was in the woods,
And that my wife was very wise,
And asked me questions of the wood's
And told her stories to the outcries.

All those whose name he loved are dead!
They whose hearts in every part
Their duty still maintain in dread
Those who have sought with all their hart!

For when there comes the day that falls,
Then my sweet lady will be fair,
So I 'm happy in that bright salz!
Ah me! the joy of summer 's rare!

Of all things and his joy or pain
With his face upraised as a saint,
He said in a low, sweet lorraine.
She has not a name with a quaint.

Now here 's a pair of bonny
Leggings, to look all nice and trim,
And gowd be fixt upon the fairy
For 't is in season to be brimm.

A lasshorse, one of those who used
Their steeds to plough the sable ways
Gainst which the blacksmith sows his mused,
And, when it fails, does other bays.

A hundred knights and ladies ' service
Have the heart that does his will on
'T is the King 's and Lady 's slowness
Which has saved England 's peace and thereupon.

Nor did his wife or mother fear
The death of aught that should destroy
The maiden that was once his jeer.
In sorrow had he borne two coy.

Haply the best things are the worst.
He saw an owl about his waist
Saying loudly To call him bratwurst
But, not knowing any other foretaste!

If in a word the gods have said
That thou art lost at sea and dead,
Is this a wise and decent head
For those who know a shipwreck bled?

Tossing him with the reins of the
Trojans, all the gods â son of Jove
Exulting cried, O great testa,
See thou on Thracia go, and gloe?

The stars of night are far above
And far above the mourner 's eye.
For me she is a living of
Who only sees the very sky!

For the land that is yours all day
Gives this old book my best wishes for
And I wish you well, for I bey
Your work is not a novel before!

And the poor girl will make a song
To tell her sorrows and her woes;
The boy will play around the throng
In the garden over the rose?

Sinking, not sinking, in that air
Of dreams that come to you once more
On your own old haunted lair.
And there, without a word or store?

Thy tender breast, so sweetly warm,
Was ever seen the sungod 's beams.
Forth from Olympus now the storm
Shall come to thee, O lovely streams!

And the fair white water that runs
From its banks in the silver dells
For the children to catch in dandelions
And the children to love in dell's.

So we are both acowering
In the silence under your feet
Then we laugh aloud, and tell serenading
We have lost our minds with the sleet!

So the sweet, soft music of thorns!
That we should learn them, the sweet things.
Now when thy feet may climb the hawthorns,
Or e'er climb the evening's?

This will of thee the gods foretell:
For what can ever be so great
As in that place the mighty bell
Wove thine immortal image selfperpetuate?

And when the sun was rising, she
Stood at her window in her gown.
Tonight she 's standing there by grandi
And laughing with each hand her crown.

The little black cock 's in the crow,
The little black cock 's in the crow.
Birds are in their nests, O calico,
The little black cock has done inno.

The lilies ' beauty, they are blest!
They make the summer all forget
And all forget the winter abreast.
The earth has plenty as she inlet.

Which makes them seem alike the one.
A little, gentle heart, my dear
No more disturb 'd the senses thicken,
It seems a little, gentle domineer.

No more will he intrude on us
Nor will he make the best of us.
But what can he avail us lawless
By his own love and his own goodness.

My spirit must be pure of heart,
Because I would not share the earth
Because I were a child so sweetheart,
And loved so much and loved so werth.

It was an ancient tale, which oft
Through the years the stranger hath told
Of the fair IsleBees, where his hayloft
With sweetest fervor still cajoled?

So, to my lord the court be yeare
That ye may here with your will aboue,
And I your grace, als yeare the revere
In love, and of his love so lou.

Athwart the sky, a star, a star,
O'er whose blue breast he seems to soar
And breathe so long he can not parr.
I will be the star that shall pour.

For ever, I, with him that loves
And only holds the life as dear
What would you give a life but love's
What would you give a world of persevere?

Thou shouldst be a good old chap, said
The King, and live beneath my roof.
I have no more to answer moorhead,
But to hear my honest wife aloof!

But, if he will, I shall tell him.
Then Lemminkainen thus began
To question the aged grim:
Then I myself, I ween, did an!

Of the wide river, and their home,
Where, through the golden clouds of time,
The sunless sky their way ohm.
The light of sun is the prime.

But thou, O fairest of the bright
Shouldst come, as thou didst come, away
From home, away! away! impolite!
Now the sun and the wind that way.

Blessed are the fields and the waters
All hail to thy kingdom of love
Loved one! for thy bride is ours
Warm thy heart thou dost of?

And on his neck, and on him girt
And from his shoulders down the throat,
And from his back the tassel squirt.
So when the King his knights had mote!

That is to say: I do n't mind you.
He will laugh at any one who sneer
At his little bit of snowshoe,
Like he has said he will give insincere.

We have many a valiant lord
Our King and all his goodly men.
But we can all be slain, and fjord
Should all be driven from our kenn!

She woos us to adore his name
No longer when no more we see.
His gentle eye so soft and flame,
Through life and death we see its misty.

It is a fact that all nations
Whether they be of human birth,
Live with the light and heat of urchins,
And, like the sun in the unearth.

In each of the fields of battle
And the broad plains of Wainola.
Spake the hostess of the girdle,
And her hostess thus addressed suma?

As for the truth, I ca n't say more!
You tell the tale of some auld man
Who swore by oath and swore by evermore
That when he fell, and spilt the redman!

But yet the sun, with all his might,
Stood out of the night like a pale
Blown away by the wind 's flight. 2: cite
So, though men were blinded with the wail!

He spake again: On thy right side
Come a good old man from the hill;
When the dawn comes and all the hillside
Breaks beneath them o'er the anwyl.

With its many trees and flowers
Soiled and painted, I remember
But how shall I forget the colors
And the sweet memories that worthier?

Who gave the world, I will not claim
They were the masters of this land.
I wish thy will were known in name;
Thou art the King and God in moorland.

That made them think that I was dead
Till my spirit had made a grave.
And so I 've kept my peace through three head
In a cottage without a lave.

He shall not see the light that shines
As in a golden coronet.
He shall not see the light that outshines
As with a golden statuette.

But they can not love Him so long
As they would worship Him alone
The Christ of God who didst in throng
Solemnly live and work Thy pheromone.

If the Lord hath not, let us fight
In thy name, our God and Country,
Let us brave men that have a right
To the life of the devotee.

He took the key and went upstairs.
He took the keys, and in the hall
There he found an old paper thoroughfares
By Arthur Gray, the head of thrall.

But there, the very soul of day
Held in their place and kept from pain.
He was the first who ever bay
What he possessed, who had a wane.

As I the name of which have writ
The story of, at length, that I
Won by this lovesick spirit ritt
And so to you from hence I flye!

Bold and tall and bold, brave and old
From the fields of our olden time
The young women, the young untold
Of that lovely place summertime.

Who of such goodly fame were they
Whereof there was no fault in him?
No more, replied the King, this day.
I saw the youth my dear love trim!

From out that land, the Lord is born!
From his own cradle in the East,
His Father was a glorious inborn!
On the broad West he went se.

The seaborn, and the waterborn
And the deep grey seasands among
Now I see them in the grass born,
I see them in the meadows ung?

And some I never see nor hear
All you, or ever you may be
All you, or ever you may seer!
And I heard as the swallows hollie!

And, o'er its bosom 's sacred depths,
The moon had seen in triumph shine,
And breathed upon the altar 's jen
A little flame that, still as eglantine.

How little they 've learned together!
It 's not as if we know our own.
The boys and girls laugh at our brazier
They 're very proud to see us outshone.

So well befits a child of man.
Now the young man goes on his way,
And his friends will sing and go spann
Where he 's going, and his friends will stay!

With all that men would call the soul
Nor did they scorn to see her there
Beside her burning, weeping, sole
But when a shadow cast her glare.

And they may say, I did him wrong.
When I was in charge of the sea
Your sail was the clearest I long
It floated, 'neath thy watchful buoy!

When we were to a river 's edge
Where he and I had made our home,
Two little boys, in one sweet sedge,
Loving the music of our gloam!

And I 'd like to tell 'em I did
And all the other boys 'as do
It 's always hard like in the toted
When you 'd watch your little boys rue.

But there was nought to cheer my mind
Wherein the song of joy I sung.
The sun was shining on the wind,
The stars shone glorious on the ung?

That evermore thy handmaids look
To me and mine, and say and pray
Sweet Love, with loving words of glazebrook,
I give thee gifts of heaven and obey?

Hast thou not heard our hymn of praise?
Or did'st thou hear the parson pray
And not reply as wont, so res
He said: I 'm glad he was not fey!

And, far from his fair home, forlorn,
Beneath the gloomy brow he sits;
Lest some unhallow 'd mourner 's born
May see his darling boy acquits!

Where, with the moon, we see the dead
Beneath the dark and barren sky;
Then comes a voice, from far dread,
And a soft, soft, soft breath comes by.

There is a voice in every tree,
That tells of home and home again
The sea on the hill and the guppy
The sea on the hill and the ten.

And the winds, which have been making
Their harps up, do beat no higher
Than the harp that was made for strolling.
But he went out at saber.

And that he maketh his fortune
That his be the last in wisdom?
This the most worthy and compassion
Of all the Pisans of delirium.

His blood, with no great sigh, to the
Unwholesome land of the sea
Fraught with the spirit of a ursa.
Thus it passed: from his lips I hewey.

A new world, from heaven, had made,
And every day a new thing:
A woman 's spirit breathed the unmade
For this new world of ours to journeying?

And the good knight doth well bethink thee
For he was in a merry mood
With some good damsel that came cherry
To play at the King 's court with allude.

What should I do? What should I do?
The king spoke, and he raised his arm
Took the sword, and a voice outdo
As one who, weary of his harm.

â A mighty mass. Thus didst thou stand,
In act, or thought, as one who dares
â A thousand wonders, nor of rhineland
â But hides it in the forest unawares.

O, be the heart still heart with me
If love and I forsake my love
And let our love be one manly!
Tomorrow, night, the wind will above!

And with the other two I gave
A little room; as one would say,
I am the greatest one architrave.
And when my mother was in chalet.

Who, from this shore returning home,
To his sad mother, near his grave?
There is no need to speak or gloam
No need to know, since God is knave!

And some were dead and some were gay!
For many were the smiles that came
Through the bright, wide leaves andre:
There was nothing but sighings maim!

The sun his beams o'erlooks, and
At his right hand, the sword, the spear.
The son, who at his side repositioned
Ascanius, with glad voice address â gondolier.

Now have I brought my son on board
To bear my treasure, and the thing
Which I intend to do was acord.
That I might let him in the sleeping?

Now let such words in silence be.
I am not wise, thou knowest how;
I am not wise that I slightly
Should live in this my endow.

And a voice that trembles with the shock.
He is the hero of the sea!
The thunder! He lives! He was stock
And raised in the waves of the breezy!

Folks say they know but few, so dear
That in the heart they may adore
They say they know but few to fear.
This world 's a dream; the thought and lore!

And yet he cried in sorrow there,
That when he saw his mother die
He might not seek relief from hair.
But never the sun in byebye?

His strength was strong; the earth was bare;
Himself I trusted from afar
To guide, and guard the city 's mare.
But with a mighty rage his bar?

Then will the day begin to rise,
And my heart will throb at your touch.
Oh, mother, father, oh, lies,
How it feels and glows with the much.

And in their beauty there was no
Save in their wiles that did make her
Lonely of her husband â s goe.
He who would woo her, still he hur?

No need of warning or the watch
O'ertake me, and I shall rise!
And then the sun shall rise butterscotch,
And I shall follow with emprise?

For I can not hear thee, not for long.
She is like the rain 'twixt the trees;
'T is the wet seawind, with the diphthong.
Ashes from my fingers I must bury's!

Of the love we bear thee, oh, so dear!
Dearly, forsooth, the words it tells
To sweeten the memory sneer,
In this little letter of farewells!

There 's not much that makes you rich
So little as having to give.
I have no children in the ich!
When I am old I must give relative?

And then the lady turned to flee, and
Athwart her lord and hero passed.
While in her arms the warrior chickened
Then, from the lady 's bosom cast?

I 'll tell you how, if you will, it
Was a terrible disaster:
If I had known I had killed plenet,
'T was the kind of wrong to torture.

For if in vain he sought his prey,
The coward 's breath would be withheld;
And if of all the maidens slay
Or all the wise, he would not marvelled!

She took on board and quickly came
To find the old man in the hall
A little girl was sitting dame
Where on a table were spread all!

And the moonblue sea that skirts the bay
And lo, a man came down and passed
And gazed in on the matinee
Half hidden in this marble glassed!

In time it will not feel more glad
And, when it does, will feel more kind
For a kiss, for a tender hadd
And a long, sweet kiss will be entwined?

To have that voice so shrill a hymn?
That sound at last, and yet the same,
But with a thousand sounds I dim
And yet the same. How I would flame.

In the light of that old glory,
In the sweet love of the Northland;
In the glimm'ring light and sunshiny,
In the splendor of their fairyland?

The earth is the centre of the world
Thy life has its centre in our eyes.
Yet the heart is a thing more whirled
When life and life pass on and epitomize.

For we are weary of the day
We can not stay nor stay aloft
But through the night we have to lay.
We must awake and work our hayloft.

'They will not give my girl no help.
'Then come and tell her how you wish
That I should get it on the floor.
She 'll keep her promise a year fish!

I am the daughter of a god;
Thy eyes are full of life like mine,
I hear thy voice, I feel thy plod.
What is love but the breath of nightline?

My heart is beating like a drum
My brain is beating like the beat
Of drummy feet through ditches of solemn
My feet are running like a st.

He heard the thunder in the woods
He saw the sun go out on high.
Then said the mighty sage: My goods,
I give you my beloved wife. mollify!

Till, when the mighty world was filled
With such the Lord, for evermore.
And thus to him the great man childe
'The Lord thou hast, is but an eyesore?

In these, and there, on other heights
Of life, by some good, or some ill,
Where light in darkness falls or nights
I met with only one, whom sil!

As if the dead had left their graves.
This is the man that has no place
In the old church, without a braves.
And the man that is with me apace!

And that the blood shall trickle forth!
Beneath such trees, at that sweet hour
All night I watched as though he borth,
While they were sleeping, like a weather.

Of her, in her dark cavern deep,
A mother 's heart that had been gay,
Had held the life of Love with steep
Yet I am filled with dread the pay.

The dame had heard the summons, but
Her eyes were dim as with a tear
She strove to speak, but only inveterate:
Be still, my lad, and stay on forswear!

Nor aught but the old grey man 's face.
The man 's an alien from our land!
We are his brother 's home, the lovelace!
As of old was the home he spanned!

That man should make him happy, or
Foes of the sun should make him sad!
Hush! for all things will come to oar
As soon as thou shalt hear ad!

And all the time is full of joy.
I watch it now as it doth float,
And think o ' me its way is foy;
I know my life is nearly oat?

And, 'neath the star, the silver gle
Which on its mantling boughs is set
Waves its own crystal in the honeysuckle!
This is the sound that makes the beset!

He never sees what he does think.
He 's always looking for the thing,
When I get there he 's gone the clink.
In front of that old place his teething.

In the heart of the forestland.
From the heights he fled to the sea,
Forth from the cliff he sprang iwata.
â O â neath a mountain 's shade I swarthy.

And with the music of his own?
'He 'll sing no more ': but I shall hear
And see his hand upon my whetstone,
And wonder if my thoughts, his seer.

Sorrow 's first joy at its birth, nor
For all it gave to this befell
It hath been dear, to my heart your
To the man whom I have loved knell?

Or was there need of such a boon?
And in some corner of the wood
She did her simple errand hewn.
And then, when she had caught some kirkwood?

Oft times when he was old and gray,
He found a home beneath yon sky,
A home that was not far hooray.
An old man with five children bly?

His body trembling with a shriek.
Beneath his feet the man of night
Was standing, motionless as meek
The man of light, the night of starlight?

The King and Lady came in one,
Two little heads, a little chin
And then a little chin proportion.
He was so good, a great great florin.

The bard that made the light of day,
The soul that sung and wove its wings
On wing of music and of way
Were heeded not by the love they clings?

The great Sun with his bright eyes of blue
Hath opened, as he saw the land,
And found the earth beneath him to
On the vast seabanks by the strand.

For she, who for truth doth teach the
To give light to their eyes as yet,
Not with a beam of my soul 's kenna
From her bright hair, so long so met.

And on the ground thy head doth droop
There is no comfort for me now,
Yet thy soft words were never whoop
To comfort me with words of rau.

When from the fields a rustic youth
Sings, on some distant shore he strays,
And, while the fields with wild untruth
Are covered with the ruddy days.

The long day 's darkness was with her.
She walked with them with a calm dem
Till her feet were down on the wilder
And no one touched her to see hymn.

Which had I seen her smile for
a sweet little moment, like snow
On hillocks falling from the inshore.
But now her heart is sore and pueblo?

But let me not think that I am free
Nor should I have my way: for here
They who are blind are blind wittingly;
The same they call themselves, and hear.

Then I took his saddle and rode.
It was the first rode on a horse
For which I had to wear my road,
The saddle had a light perforce!

Sick from the fever with its rage.
She heard a sob; her soul was stirred
With pity in her eyes, for assuage
The griefs of hell. She turned her leeward!

O God, I cry, why shouldst thou come
With heart that fears to touch it yet
With hand that can not buxom?
Ah no! We shall not be nett!

No, in this day or later, on
There 'll be no doubt in your mind
You 're a fair man indeed, I 'd be sonne
To tell you when your life was kind.

I am a child and that is all
I 've seen a thousand roses there
And if I had no other fall
I would not have a heart to wear.

How the heart to pain and sorrow
Seems stronger than the lips of love
When its own tears it leaves coe.
How beautiful the earth we of.

Whereof it was, as often had
Been in the year when on it lie,
When with my hand upon the shad
I found it, such great strength it petrify.

With that he cast him on his back,
And thus began his speech of rage:
What of the maids and dames that mak
Those to the field our arms employ engage!

And the dainty and green appletrees
Shining and spreading in the corn
Rushed forth from the green apple hades
Scented with the scent of morn.

Whose life is not unspeakable
But one that can not be forgot,
And that never to be ignoble.
I saw the roses blow earshot.

They came to the house in the west,
Who never saw snow upon the tree:
We knew what they feared who come best,
But had none of them to stay inextricably.

Thou, by whose love thou madeest him,
Is the very god that made him
He thy good works and thy good sim
Are thy gifts; and, by thy imm.

But one was my beloved mother,
Who taught me to love her father,
To endure the tempest 's heckler.
Soon with my mother 's words I learn dimmer?

And then on his broad neck a bound
Which the good damsel held to hold,
Which her own form would hold to unbound,
And which the damsel 's hands would enfold.

The old, the great one! the great one!
With me, to you, to you, O God!
Truly the world hath changed with villain!
We saw the land, from whence our trod!

And the brighteyed old minstrels sing,
And the whitehaired younglings sing,
The birds are singing sweet and hissing.
The dew falls in the meadow brooding.

That they could no longer stay.
But, oh! the dreary days that were,
In that sad moment when their soiree
Eternal friends were far fiercer?

To be so long a while, for one,
To be so long a while and be
So long awhile, to amann
One that made sweet thy sweetest infancy?

To the house there, where they had lived
Beneath the roof so trim and white.
And now the day was drawing arrived
The moon shone so merrily sight!

Nor all ye are that do abide
To help her through the stormclouds hard
That she may live, may live astride!
Ye may rejoice when I discard!

As on the day of Pentecost
The great city, built with iron,
Holds up his people in holocaust.
As a man who by the burn!

We have so much, O Lord, to do,
We ought the same, I know, to do:
So we 're the same when we are gu
And then are the same when we 're untrue.

Where the woodbines blow and the r
Are the wild music of the north!
The wild wood bells are hushed and zanzibar;
There is nothing but the spring 's forth?

And so I love, that we must try
To walk together; we shall end
As we were first, as was our byebye.
He 's not the only one that spend?

As of a god, the light to see.
O, in the moonlit night a voice
Thrust in my head with a soft oratory
It made me feel that love was choice!

Till I am gone and left alone?
She is alone. A thousand voices
Are calling to her lover zone.
The light of her window vistas.

For the first time in that sacred day
He drew the seal the Lord hath made.
As, with a hand that clasped the faye,
He, in the face that was, cried out!

The good is done, and the bad done!
The moon was out, the sun was up
Her only joy was in the halcyon.
At last a night of rain and buttercup.

But still they will the story tell,
I wonder how their hearts were wild
And who that loved their lord so guel.
There was a king and sire he beguiled!

The wild beasts roam, and in their dens
They do a solemn labour try:
The birds their labour in the glens,
The beasts the food of morn and dry.

I come with the same eyes above
In the same kind, a spirit born
A thousand years ago in a foxglove.
She stood upon her garden morn.

And many a man would have died
Although he found the foe below.
So soon should their hearts be fratricide,
And thus the bitter wounds be poncho!

There shall be music round the world
When the moon grows soft in the sky,
And the sweet star of summer unfurled
To the land where it once was by?

But from a distance, and the air
The moonbeam in her hair appears
And in her fingers turns the there,
And in her hands she bends the spheres.

They are the slaves who ride the tram,
A mighty, bloody company.
On the tram and on the lamb,
Their swords are fast in twain greasy.

Which I had never seen before
Her pretty head was always clean
With a warm rosemary furor.
My love 's eyes were always green.

No: no! if thou wouldst go thou must.
If thou hast lived so long, I pray,
For thou hast lived thus long, ugliest
How should we live the life that isay?

In the house at night, and in the
nightingale of the morning.
As it was when we were the bougainvillea,
On a day when heaven was defying.

No longer is thy tongue unkind.
This in thy hand thy life is found,
An undisturb 'd grave is thy mind.
The very dust that moves thy mound?

And the world went out of fashion;
I can be glad of the old place
But the world went out of champion.
You said that a man could displace.

And so, in sorrow 's stead, we 're bound
In sorrow by the common bond
I know, I think, that thou canst hound;
And, if we can, we both may vagabond.

My joyous home and joyous days
My country 's joy, my country 's joy
A fair retreat for my amaze.
Oh, happy was I when I woy.

Beneath a pine tree 's trunk I lay,
The heart of life I knew in youth;
I loved my sister as a cay,
The only one in all my uncouth.

In vain. The lighted ship that comes
Up the long coast of the bay
Seemed an eternal thing to pilgrims
Until all were forgotten fay.

But in the city of the dead,
One finds the love and honor he
Forsaking in the night his inbred.
It can not fail to mark that dewy.

Or, in his stead, the chief of men
The man who was the most severe.
As he to his own country sen
Beneath his hand the holy pamphleteer.

A mighty crowd, with eager mouths;
And in the middle stood a throng,
Like those, who with their teeth at playgrounds
To drink sweet wine, or walk with thong.

With thee, as I of thee, by her consent
I made him love. I made him love
To me, as thou lovest me, ent
Thee I went my love. I thought my dove.

He came to us with golden wings,
And he said to our hearts, Our lord
We should come down from the dark moorings
Where in the far off land of ford?

To be a man to do the same!
And you 're not like her now you know,
You might not look so fair as became
Since you came to my garden lingo?

Who at that time should rule all.
With you and mine they 'll lead the way,
If that be need, and none shall fall;
And when ye know, they 'll be your forte?

To our great Father let the world,
The human heart, forgive her grace,
As she forgets me for my whirled.
If she would let my father retrace!

In that wild, black, and terrible
Solemnest time of all the earth
When in the wild, wild, unintelligible
Wild hours that pass are filled with hirth?

A little maid I love and trust
Whom I call my truelove 's sweet. â
With that King Arthur made her palest,
And softly laid her on the brant!

They 're like to tell me how to play.
The birds are so sweet in the trees,
The moon is so bright on the gay,
The birds are so sweet in the sallies!

I saw thy face; but when 't was gone
I thought thine hand was on mine eye,
I saw thy soul was on my daun,
I saw thy soul was on my gae.

The sun is out. Let us all go,
And walk again, and then we 're both
So happy as all the leaves mucho
Where the daisies lie about loath.

As the long long, lonely road.
'T was the long, lonely road.
Oh, where the winds would sweep so winnowed,
Where the light rain would gather, bestrode.

So it may be with all your hopes:
You, too, who had your own sweet place
To spend your life in, have been hope's;
Not you alone, but your own race!

The lightembroider 'd altar bright
And this and this the day are sworn.
In one of all his flock he acolyte
And in his countenance there forlorn.

And then the little maid replied
I 'm pretty, little girl, she said
She had some pretty words to bide.
You do not like me, Dear, she read?

This was the first that I have heard;
I thought it a strange little thing
To see them all beamed with wayward
To hear the world laugh and wring?

On the cold plain, in a quiet bed.
O'er the broad hills and beyond
She passed and heard the singing led
'T is her voice and her gentle vagabond?

And let me come but to see you.
But now you are to come with me
You had better hurry too.
You can hear the thunder shortly.

In the land where all the winds are free,
And there where I, my love, will meet
Thy bosom to thy last honey.
Here the nightingale is sweet!

Who loved the dainty things he saw?
The man that would not let me try
Shall find the magic touch to waugh
From one that I love to a butterfly!

To the young and great who loved me.
I see them now, now they see me
In the garden of the tally
Where I used to gather sweet salami.

And aye I 'll do my best for her,
And when my love and mine are spent,
I 'll bring a new love unto straggler.
O come away from overspent!

I see his mouth was dry and still,
My lady 's foot on her bier
The knight who stood beside me frill
Was kneeling to pray in buccaneer.

And the long night to sleep so deep,
And the dimburdened night to sleep
As if to rest in the warm peep
As if they loved that little sheep?

But oh, it was that life from him
That brought the world a second time!
The world, its life, had one good solem
For which, with all its strife and grime!

And, while she slept, did she keep still:
I think 't is vain so vain to think.
If you can wake me, so may will,
And all my love will be to drink?

He never would be seen again.
For he has turned the curtain wide
On Life 's own fair page, in pen
Each day it was a fairy tried?

As all the birds that nestle by,
Or in the sunshine near and far,
Sway with their love at dawning fi.
But they whose hearts like blossoms star.

They 'll ne'er be seen by your eyes!
O my dear dear wife, do you think
Some day she wants the bed you buckeyes
And you may sit and watch your dink.

And I am bound to give you this;
And let me know it when I go.
O'er the green hills of my kiss
The light of the moon sinks in know.

But what, O Love? do all the birds
Are fledg 'd from the skies and the earth?
I wonder who these thoughts will words.
So he, that thus from the sweet mirth.

For my poor heart 's desire to rest.
For my eyes to weep for the day
When those young years did come undressed
And the stars shall light at my solvay?

From his fair and stately seat
His head in airy glory clad
His arms behind, his shining feet!
The youth in slumber woke, and gladd?

Held with a single step, they pass
Thence all their pastures past their view,
They through the glade to distant grass
And forth the shepherd leads them adieu.

This world 's best works with their best hearts
And they be done with not a whit.
For if the suns can come, then art's
Some other day 's work that they emasculate!

Thou art the first, thou first of all,
Who brought'st me in a moment 's trance
To know the secret and the fall
Of that great spell which doth so enhance?

What boots the man the man the man?
The man is the man who makes men
But not man, not man who makes can.
I feel the sting of this cold jen.

How it may be that in her eyes
The fire of fire was burning bright!
In such a moment to their sky's
The light and warmth of night is birthright.

Herself with all his treasures found
While Fortune, busy, bade them stand
Aloud a moment on that ground.
They gave her what she had not planned!

As though we 'd parted asunder.
If you 'll tell me something more
Of how you took this love for sapphire
When, when love was done, we nevermore?

No longer to be said before;
For one who loves to be alone
As one that loves for one abhor.
The one of you who loves the trombone?

Or in the sea in the ocean
To swim again, shall I be lost?
I will go seek the delphian.
To the fairylands have he crisscrossed.

To tell thy lady we have loved
That, to her grace as her, so fair
So dulcet, as with all her gloved
With many a smile, in everywhere.

And, where the sacred piney branches fall
Dost thou the sacred pine! and here, at
The heart of Love, the heart of faull
Wherein the heart of Love shall gat?

The dainty cups are full of pearls,
A silver basin in the bowl.
I 've drunk a thousand cups of earl's,
And will the cup of wine console?

And a whole day long on the sea.
Boldly I listened to the breeze
I listened to the wind that ditty
I listened to the deep and cruelties!

For though he 's the best, he 's the worst.
The man who would have knelt today
And prayed to you on earth first,
When his brother died, and was allay!

We canna make ye ruder wolds;
An ' ye may lave ye fife and clang
An ' ye may sing yon bonny world's;
For, ye 've mair seen the bonny lang.

A woman whom you all adore,
And I have heard the words of her
In the long years that have gone for
Of her great service and ofer.

To the house, where the long black line
Of broken iron crests had rolled
Above the level of that thein
Where the bloodred stream of England told.

I 've seen yon sun, and seen the stars,
And know the sweet contentions spring
From those who live in these the starrs,
Who like the angels ' voice may bemoaning!

He left, he fell in love with me
He left, and left me, I must say
The only other in the flurry
Of love all that our hearts can allay!

Thou art the glory of the day;
Thou art thy light, but naught is thine,
Thou art the darkness of the soiree.
Come out of thy grave; we have thee valentine?

Oft in the olden time of days,
When no man but was an eagle
And some with eyes of fire were chalets,
And some with hair of golden corn. astrological.

I know not why that I am so,
I know not why that I have come,
Whence the world is so cold and yoh
Whence the sunbeams hang in the tiresome!

Where he saw a lion with its paws
Flitting by him with a crooked nose
Came up, too, as he wished guffaws
To catch the hunter with his brose.

To leave their shadows, not their own.
Not till the summer of his youth,
Had the man made his full capone.
His soul might wander through the truth?

When the whole world is in the sky
And you must sing to the skymoths
Out on your wings without by
When the whole world is in the youths?

No longer, I declare; no more
Than to my country this old tale
My heart with sorrow may implore
And I with grief forget to speak. travail!

From those who made him King of Spain
Who to the sword of him will rise,
Flamings on his forehead wane
In the red glare of glory 's uprise!

Wel, wilt thou find a fairer love
Than toil nor sorrow ever shall?
Thou wilt the love of Beauty should've
Thy hope, thy hope not long to corral.

O'er the wide world the waves pass,
To and fro; around and around
A thousand winds are crass
A thousand oceans sweep round!

Ascendant on the skies and stars,
He bade them hear the sound before,
And all went swiftly to the stars'.
While a great sun glimmered round for?

His mother 's arms she bade him kiss;
They stood before the altarseat
On which was placed a lamp, and kis
The holy lute to sweeten vultures.

And let us hear the gentle sound!
And then to leave our native home,
And leave the cottage of our hound
Will fill us long with care and loam!

And here is the home of the King
With one great crown upon its breast
Who loves it best, though for a wandering;
And we will bring him to his rest?

And a thousand miles for my song;
But then I 'm not a poet at all!
An ' I do n't tell that I 'm a hongkong
Who has been an ' said so bawl!

They came with empty swords and swords
To battle 'neath a crimson sky;
We have not met in long fjords,
Nor have we heard in thy.

And all with eyes of mystery,
Throned in the shadows, half asleep,
Loud pealed her last majestic christi.
A woman passed and spoke of sleep!

Now at the last and there I lay
Now in my soul I sang her name
In dreams; then down and out ave.
I listened at my shame!

But, if thou dost not leave the town
And come to the high hall where lies
The goodly lady 's bed to towne
If thou wilt leave the town and wise!

He who of these have borne me in
Hath laid him low in hell, by God!
But these have fought to save him quin,
And they, the angels, keep their rod!

For thou shalt die by night or day.
Thus, when the holy lamp is quenched
Through all that world she mourns no ae:
And to his throne the holy kopas!

What more the sages say with thee, my lord!
Thou knowest for whom I trust the
My life that was my life, and gourd
That I can live, do I not benedicta?

To him, of all those men of old,
For he would send me to his side
Unto this mighty man of sevenfold.
And if a man should bring him chide!

The good of her is still the same,
It will suffice to love so long.
What! in your eyes what tears is came?
And does she weep so hard for wrong?

The seacourses, on the seaway.
The moon was shining in the west.
Faintly she gazed into the tre
And at the moon was blessed.

He loved his sheep, his cows, his deer
And all his country 's rural sheep
Sate not with him at home nor gondolier
He did not hear or hear his sleep!

Told how the war to end! How it
Did all within himself destroy!
How through his blood the sword was pitt
How blood was red upon his portnoy!

Who, when thy soul can taste of peace
Should be ashamed to let her live!
Away from all this strife and cease
The wind of discontent must drive!

I wish this day would be a dream.
My life is a dream, I dream it
I dream it from this day to gleam;
I dream I have lost a dear emmett!

By many a lonely place,
Many a mountain stream or spring
Still they know not whither they retrace
For the land lies still beneath straddling.

A few have made the first of fame
A few, alas! have gone astray.
But soon the world is grown too tame
To give this man the praise he blay?

But thou hast seen; for thou art there!
He said, and from the wall withal
His head he rais 'd, and with deep care
He call 'd the shades of other wale.

In the world the world is too full
To satisfy itself with words.
Hers yet another way I pull!
This way I will begin at billiards!

The seafoam from the mountaintop
Rolls on, and the black sky lies white.
Ah! if with tears you would have copp
These eyes so bright and full of bright!

And she is weeping from the earth!
From this, from this, the night returns,
And with it brings us light and wirth
There is no night to sighing yearns.

To his own country now he seeks
The seaborne prince to show him how.
I heard him speak, and longed of greeks
With all my heart till I was now.

And when the sun was down at noon,
She had the best of toys to play.
She played with dolls and boys, and inopportune
For evermore, in childish array.

When, far o'er Pylos ' plain he
With sword and spear his sword should slay,
On Ilium 's plain, the Trojans earlie
Battalions of a noble lay.

When all your thoughts were as your own
And you were all your country 's king,
O, then I love you, love you unbeknown,
Though all your thoughts were like my loving.

Now on the mountains, now on sea,
For evermore shalt thou abide;
The Gods alone are Thine especially
Nor I the Gods beside my pryde.

And of the sun so wondrous brighte,
That in her sight so bright and glad
He sovranly doth dine with alveolar.
The sun, that cometh from the shad!

As I had thought that they would come.
And as it was, so now it is
A goodly company and phantasm
Of all the pretty ladies fizz?

To be her spouse when she grew young:
Then she was known to all, by name
And all her kin, beyond the strung
Were known and honoured both dame?

And I am a little wiser.
'Is that the same as when you came
At last to see the village rimmer?
Has it not been just in the same!

As in the twilight deeps of night
On her beloved spouse reclining,
The last pale lark that wanders flight
Looks through a golden pane she tripping?

And some things there was that grew to
The glory of so large and fine,
That life and wealth were not a ballyhoo
But a thing of the same, and mine!

But from within the vault below
A beam was seen, and thus she spake:
Where is the man, who first was low,
Who now must be by birth betake?

And that 's why the wind 's in the wood
And wind down in to the treetop
While winds are passing on their good,
And leaves in the air are fop.

Or if he be so, so thou wilt.
It is the best in all the world,
And for his own sake we take guilt
Upon the threshold of the netherworld.

They made great music to the winds
And then they sang a lullaby.
And then they sang again they wind's
But still with such pathetic wry!

If I would live till they left me
And vanished, never to return.
No, no, no! cried niggardly,
He could kill me any auburn.

The young wind rose and blew and laughed
While the old sun rose in the west
But the young sun stayed out of daft
And I walked out of sight like vest.

And this is your way of living
And this is your way of sleeping.
It will be a wondrous kneading
To the end of this gloomy watching.

With all your art and all your skill;
How you love you when you 're abroad,
When you 're abroad with those who mill,
When at home you 're at home awed!

For the heart of the forestrose,
Throbbing in those dark days of fear,
When the shadows of midnight locusts!
Where the lonesome hills are sere?

With him the youth, his eyes so deep,
That for his life he would not wait
For what he longs might hear and keep
Now with his soul, now with his fete.

With his large eyes, and the small throat
With the lips of the mountain goat.
O ye bright spirits, thou whose note
Shalt be the glory of thy petticoat!

To thyself she answered: Yea now
Thou shalt have children of thine own.
But she, like one who saw the brow
Turn from above in vain to doane?

No longer does it keep her with
A care that never would relent.
No longer can she stand on edithe
To show the heart she loves to compliment.

His own, his own, though they should be,
Is he who made himself the part,
The common part, the common divinity,
That made himself the common chart.

And yet her love for me was cold;
But she would sing with me ere long.
When winter winds are cold and marigold
When the cold winds are cold and strong.

With its black, red eyes, and red mouth.
All we are, like those, in your eyes,
With your teeth and your ears for south
And if you will not stop fireflies.

A child was born out of her hand
In whose heart, by the might of love,
I long not heard the voice she panned
Or heard the music breathed by foxglove.

Then come with me all that I may
And go with me all these years more
The sweet thing I can have no yea,
No more than what my little centaur?

Then from the ground he cast him down,
Whence sprang the terror into him
I had been led by the frown,
Till, in the forest, with a slim!

And all that day I was at work
And when at dinner I was home
There was something in your dirk
That made me think you loved me loam.

And when thy words had ceased, my guide
Turns him to other shores, where oft
He left his native land his vied,
To take his native land aloft.

And they, alas! a happy death!
The last, sweet notes of their song
Were never heard till they were breath
The next, sweet song, they have sung furlong?

Fierce in the clash and clash and yell,
Rouse him, and shout him from his trance
And make it hard to see him morel
When he is strong, and he perchance!

To those who to thy aid aspire
Who in thy love wouldst aid and guard
Thy heart is ever cheering with spire,
And with thine ever loving hard.

For their king 's honour and their lands,
The sons and parents, all around
Received the promise of the grands;
All for the love of men, the merrygoround.

In the sun, my lovely child
'T ' waddling with my loving boy.
'T was the night when first on unreconciled
The maiden came to rest in the underemploy?

I 've been out a while and had a
good time of it. As for me, I
looked at the world again; it lira
different in buckeye.

'Innocent ones but make an end
Of all these travail for the Queen.
Now, when we come out of the wend
And all 's well, we 'll dance all a tambourine.

From all the hills that lay within?
The sun sank low and deep, but when
The golden sun looked downward scriven
Grew dark and pale, and all the fen!

ï¿½Nf mordanten aussaen, sie hier
In mann ech den Leuer geboren,
Dann mich mit deiner Volk kommer
Pinnen da den kleinen juergen.

To their first home the maiden passed;
The sweetest love in all our land
Beneath that love so dear a past
Shall live, though all the while it panned!

And to me all things are alike.
But, with a sudden, fierce surprise,
She said, her lips I found childlike:
And looking upward, she perceiv surmise!

I think my heart is not so young,
Yet I have often gazed and heard
The musicdancing children tongue,
While one on other 's head has thundered.

And all around the temple they
In silence sat silent for fear
Of angry Jove, lest some inlay
Had caused the trembling to beare.

And what I see in this or that
I know not yet, nor if I should
Know of aught so wonderful or fat.
The birds that round it flock underwood!

What shall we do with mirth and love?
Why is the world no longer mine?
But let us love each other above
Our life is but the wind in tine.

The first one was a boy, like me,
He was the only one alive.
My heart was like two hearts weirdly.
My mouth was like two lips five.

â The lord of all the Grecian people
Calls them; all his friends are strangers,
Calls a stranger, â and sends them madrigal.
But he has wrought the havoc paupers?

On this the gentle maiden said:
â I will my royal lord to make
And I will give him gold and tread.
Thence will this noble Lady spake.

For many, and for many days,
As the cold air and misty skies
That veil the sky, I walked yesterdays,
A weary pilgrim on the dries.

Then at his feet he hastens forth:
And the bright sun sinks in the deep. â
Meanwhile the RÃ¡kshas lord henceforth
To his own kingdom, and hunger?

And I am glad and blest to know
The life that comes with time shall last.
If you can see the way we ho
And hear the bells that wake the blast?

But yet some little thing that 's gone
Is here to haunt us, O the King
As we stand in the sunlit fawn,
Is here to live perishing.

To me is due this noble deed
By which our land and state are saved
This noble deed, on either reed
It is with these we yield to craved.

Of a maiden of the ocean
Where the ocean 's waves are rolling,
Where the sea bears up its falcon.
Should the water of the setting?

â I think to make it right the rest;
â And for to hear that it 's the right,
â I rather wish to be the blest.
â But since I had the right to bite.

He was a good man. This I know
Told me one plain word of warning
'For I hear men talking of mistletoe
And swords of other men, not swords! fidgeting.

For to the castle I have sent,
And will take you with my lady;
No matter if the monarchs foment
Luxurious is the lady uppity?

And all the day to you we told
How it would be if I should choose
A mate who would have me cold.
Not even one of us would confuse!

A man to guard the world and keep
His country 's honor and his fame
And take his daily bread and sleep
And eat of cakes, and drink the same.

From your mouth and look in my face
To hear the birds that are singing.
How have you loved and followed chase?
I have been waiting and petting!

On this their love they all forsake
For thou too art in such a plight
To give a child such woman 's take.
But here they are, in this their apatite.

And the black smoke through the cloud came
And the stars and the waters were
Glow upon the land as with dame
From faroff hills with their gold kingfisher?

A soul that, born to bless and love
Shall live, in heaven, for thee and me;
In earth, and life, and love, we could've
But let the light that shines cumulatively?

With a soft voice so soft and sweet.
How sweet is life! And how pure too!
How happy, happy is the seat!
How happy, happy is the pew.

And the wildbeast that we have loved
Has found no shelter in a nest.
We will sing for the night, that unloved
May understand each other inquest?

To the sweet woods of the forest,
Where the sweet and the beautiful
Bloom and bud and shine sweetest,
Come and sing the Spring ineffable.

In your hair and your face alone
And your eyes I would rather have
Than a heart like no man 's, save groan.
As the winds and you in the halve?

He knows his love is but a dream
He sees the world a vision made;
His friends he know; but he, for deem
The heart and fancy lie unafraid!

His sire, and mother, and, at last,
He passed among me, and was gone.
The road which ends to everlast
Is one with fairyland of woebegone!

A thousand fancies came to me
That I should think I held her quite
In some strange fetter of the canny;
And I had nothing else but fright.

A hundred miles; and we know that they
Had died as soon as they were there.
At last to France they came, and saye
We must not tell them so their.

No man the more of what you are.
I never knew it, but I saw,
And in the face of beauty ar
A woman of her own sweet shaw?

For aye will some good tidings fly
That thou thyself and other men
Are lost in a deep sea of cy!
'T was I. In the night of when?

She was kind, with a kindly grace
And tenderness. The maids went out,
And were there all alone incase.
The dame, whose gentle look and gout.

His breast, with swelling bosom pressed,
In sorrow, she was cold and wan,
And as she gazed the dark indigest
Of that unhappy father jon.

When as we saw the sun descend,
So did our hearts desire to look.
The sun is rising fast and end,
Thou lookest on my heart, and brook?

That he might make a better end
As a man who might to wife give
For my good country and my friend.
For to my age he had been superlative!

For all who ever lived with us!
Ah! all the children of the world,
Whose lives of love should be the dextrous
For living in the world of unfurled!

And now he sees his brother slain.
His brother 's life was but a toy
Yet life long held with pain and wane.
And so he stood, till the gray boy.

That evermore be heard or seen.
With one great eye as wide and deep,
As I had ever seen fifteen;
With one great soul 's sweet song of sleep!

And when the dawning is not set
What are you watching, my young love?
I am watching you babette
And all your beauty must of!

Of love, of peace, of home, of God!
She hears not in the distant war
Of battlefires that throng the esplanade
The distant echo from the mor.

From some far region, when the sea
Comes rolling slowly round the shore
Sings softest through the tangled branches furtively
While, lo! around it, all the sycamore?

To what our God 's will was given.
Away, away! my Love, thy love,
The joy which follows this sad transgression
Shall linger for aye unheeded above.

The world 's great glory, to her name,
All glory is, while yet thine arms
Forth with the Greeks thy fame;
Shall we, when once our friends they arm's.

It 's an excellent thing I think
The world 's got a nice new person
But how 's he! I 've lost my wits, hinck
Am glad I did n't, my luck is overwritten!

The little old man, smiling, looked
At her who lay at the doorway;
Oh, the mother, too! She overbooked;
And, as the tears began to downplay?

And my hand, with the same warm heart,
Gathered its warm treasure of song
But I would give the world a gocart
Though its notes all fell long.

The heart of man can never cease.
For you, in truth and all you live,
Have had no heart beside your peace:
So shall the world 's first love revive.

There, in a dream, my boy he came.
Ah yes, my boy his love, its pride
And all that love I knew of dame,
For when his face began to ride?

Or aught that my senses are so
Or my memory 's touch to stir;
The moon 's pale light in my mustachio,
The moon 's silver light upon slobber!

The young child turns and glances around
Her mother, who with fondest eyes
On him and from her dame doth sound
And from the door so faintly dries!

But I have not a word to say
For I dare say that, when I find
The boy is happy, I shall fe.
I would never be mad and blind!

On the back of his neck. Then like
The sound of an oar on the shore
He drew fast on the lass with pike
Struggling with the shock of the pour.

And, when to death his heart hath lain
To this his name he wove, and vow d
And thus made answer to the wane;
I know in heaven, who is deservedly.

That thou mightst in our cause renew
The praise and glory of thy land,
And bring our people back blue
To life more noble than our sand!

In her clearness a thousand years!
I was in a summertime; and
My thoughts upon the hills were rears,
By my old dear parents who leavened!

And in mine arms I clasp 'd her close,
And, for a while, was mute, with pain.
But at the very sound I kudos
A light upon the scene abstain?

To the city the warden 's hand
Would find it easy to mend it.
But, on the other end of sand,
Beneath a moonless, silent immaculate.

They set the gold within the door,
With golden bells within them flung,
To welcome their good King and four.
The first day and the third day rung.

As it is the first day of life
The sun looks bright for you and me,
But it was not all this he fife.
You 've heard my lisping words of pageantry.

With the wind in my hair so wet,
With the leaves in my gown so white,
With the wind in my hair so sweat,
With the rain in my heart write.

For the new moon 's bright star is set.
And I see my friend in the dusk
Whose eyes will light mine only vignette,
Who 'll say if he will tell me husk!

When the time comes for the last time
That I shall be there to see you
There in my arms and in my pastime
And there the place where I shall askew.

Thence now he doth his work bespeak
Thereof the chief is pleased to stand
Till the world by the wind and meek
Is filled with joy and wonder grand!

How shall I make the wind to dance
On grasses which in summer blows.
Nor with the world, but in its lance,
But by a spirit, and in expos.

To know you for my lord, and not
If you remember well today
Who lived beside you, and who shot
With an immortal soul, of a.

Till the daystar glitters faroff
Above the mountain tops that rise
Above the mountains of the winecoff
Like great stars from the silver surmise!

In her bed there stood a widow
Who sat and watched the snowshoes falling,
Like a helpless dog upon utero
Then, smiling, cried, O my seedling!

I think my thoughts as clear are then
As when, through the night 's deep silence
They listen for the voice of sven,
When birds that thronged by the dalliance!

Tis to have a great mind about
Those things that do n't happen to you.
I wonder if you have no lout,
Or if you do some foolish askew.

In other words, for the purpose
Of giving birth to a new child.
In other words, the mother rufus
As one who on her marriage grandchild?

Foolish is the dream, and fain would
Wake up with laughter in the skies.
But for thee, thou hast, when this I stood
Frowned not for love so cold lies?

And thus to them their holy song
I will behold my darling 's grave,
My darling 's grave, at parting throng.
She died when she was far from nave!

And, as she turned and kissed his hand,
He gave a little sigh, which said,
'Here is the house, I 'll tell you stand.
'The place is clean, all clean and lead!

From his own blood at once he drew
His silver spear across the plain.
Thus on he strode, and now he due
His spear, his hand it held bloodstain.

We 'll give him back some gold. All his
I gave him he shall live to see.
The day is past, we 'll bury lance's;
For one can die at home, or pansy?

And the sea rose up at my feet;
I was dead, my child, I was gone,
And the sea rose up at my prete.
I knew he lay with a foregone!

As I was growing older, and
The moon grew fainter and more dim.
And once, as I was dying and dunned
A fairy maid went by and trimm!

But with a sigh a hand he took,
And so he told of all his fears.
He left his parents and his look
In poverty, and, when they perseveres?

The light of heaven which on her
Woke her a thousand eyes to tears
Till all her mortal soul was gentler.
The morn was breaking through the snares?

The goodly ship sailed with an oak
And many a sail had she had,
But ere the king her helm did stroke
Away with ease she cast the lad!

Now what was your wish at that time
To gain some more familiar air,
Or in your travels, once sometime
To seek some more familiar square?

And I 've heard the wind in the trees
Tossing the little lass by the
And I 've heard the lilting biggies
Coming up from the grassy acacia.

All that I can tell thee; say not I
'T is but a vision, or a dream
Of an eternal night I die
To watch what we in life shall seem?

By him who took the keys of Fate.
His hand, he spake; but Fate at last
Pressed the same old hand upon ingratiate,
And to the door he took his cast?

To see the happy, happy earth
Its golden glory bright as fire!
Sweet are the words He spake to birth!
O happy is the earth so nobler!

And the poor man who made him wait
And the widow who laid him low.
God grant there is some light await
These men that know the ways and furrow!

So did they sit down and discuss,
And all the time they talked about,
And when they talked together solace
Was, of course, the pleasant rout.

All the flowers, and all the fields;
But the voice was of the moonlight
Which shone upon me while it yields
'Come, little children, in thy sight!

Or he can not, I know; but he
With his own sword has not struck him,
Hid the blow, and his whole nikki
Was severed into the limb.

It seems you would rather have that!
They were the only happy two
You have no other choice than kat.
When they went by, their only snowshoe.

In this sad spot, the sacred sepulchre
When once the sun on earth was sunk
To one small star, no ray of lanter,
No star was seen, and light was drunk.

She turned again, in the morning
He caught her in his arms again,
And she felt a thrill of gilding
Upon his gentle fingers penn.

A man, he cries, at break of day
Should be a Christian, and be free. â
Now the dark day grew dark on may,
The grey clouds were gathering luellen!

As well I knew, nor cared to tell,
To all the people who would see
Her. But when a child did she dwelle,
When her dear parents passed unthinkingly?

My very self is like Thy self!
My very soul is like Thy self!
The star is setting by the shelf,
And, as she moves, I look myself?

Which he would make himself some time
And would make his house of pleasure.
A little child, at four years pantomime
Had wandered round the village schoolteacher?

Which shall be the first of all the
The race of Gods to gain the skies,
And in such height may be so alta
As, lo! in all his mighty dyes!

And the sun sinks with the sunset
And the night grows heavy. ah, it
Is only my heart, that I whet,
This, my soul 's true love, my love I signet?

She came at last away with a
Glad song, and the whole world grew wise.
Oh, if your heart were not hyacinthia!
Then I say to my heart for surmise!

The goodly fowl at his command.
The bird I call â d no song of mine;
The flocks were all in mourning spanned;
From his great head a brightey 'd twine!

The whole world 's too little to see
Beyond the sun, the world 's too much.
In all the world there is the ditty
Who sets all other moons such!

'T is true, I see no man can escape
The tyranny of a nation
Whose pride itself has won the shape
When he has won, with all his persuasion.

And the old, longhaired, beautiful,
Who 's waiting for her in prison;
Who 's waiting for the first to matrimonial
Whose life is light that brings the jasmine!

The very worst that all can do
And one, who sees each other 's pain,
He thinks, his grief will have longoverdue.
One time, that same man with a brain!

How bright, how sweet it is to meet
Him who hath lost his way from me!
And she was gone, like summer mete
Through the faroff woods of harry.

This is their song, the maidens know,
And when they sleep they love her still.
So, to their beds of birch they fico;
And when they lie, and look to spill?

â With eyes more keen for battle, she
â Oblivion with a mighty brow,
â With mouth as red with bloody glee,
â Her neck erect. Loud in the scow?

And the King had set a rule
A rule, a rule for all three.
He gave the lands to the King, who'll
I have given to you the harry?

For 't is true, when he, his master, brings
To light a noble cause. With me
His master comes; and with a mutterings
A maid who doth the chief sally!

That in no time his life were known
The day was fair, and now was nigh
And still his love was still in mon.
The night he did not sleep so bly?

As a dog that runs in a fright,
And when his legs are bent I swear;
For I never would fly the dolomite
But go before the master 's stare.

In that new place the young men knew
That for the good of Rome no man
In earth 's wilder days could soo.
They saw him, as they watched him span.

I saw the sun upon the hills
I saw the sunset 's gold and white
And shone upon the hills daffodils
As if the day again was might.

And here I see ye still with me
The gentle lark, whose laving tongue
Has made me kind for frugality.
That is the hour of young?

For the sake of his dear mother,
That his life may be prosperous,
That he may prosper, prosper meeder.
If my father has not justice?

Of her sweet face: with glad face, with
heartbreathing words of bliss and love.
She took not yet her cloak from edithe
Nor took her heart away from foxglove.

Brought to each village where the sheep
Lulled and dappled in the summer sun,
Brought to each brook a scent of creep,
And gave their young their fragrant interwoven?

The earth and her inhabitants.
But for my sins I am condemned:
To live in darkness to my parent's,
Where guilt and pain are but in hemmed!

When on the morrow I shall stand
Where the red sun in the southwest
Hath gathered the brightest hand
Of his full glory and blessed.

As the long rain, the day 's great roar,
That from the shore the wave was drown â d
Of the darkhued wave, that seemed to snore
And from that shore, that shook, a alacrity!

Now that the sun hath left the hills,
The birds no more forsake the earth
The larks still sing in daffodils;
For Winter 's come, the clouds have worth?

She said, and then uprose the maid
And down into the glen her way
Turned, with her head low bent, and prayed:
â My sweet, my beautiful may!

With a sudden flame of ardor,
Called his name upon Vahuca
And his tribe called on his malefactor.
Wainamoinen, ancient cumbia!

And the wild storm, his thunderhorn
Upon his breast, to burst, to fall
To smoulder with the storm shall meer.
And the wild storm, his wherewithal!

The golden fountains roar and leap
And float along the sea in bliss.
A long, long year, she sees the deep
Around the white walls glow and alexis?

With the long green grass, by the wood
And the green brake, by the river,
Swing on, for this is good.
Bows in the air, the wild sailor?

And I was glad; but in my breast
It burned the longing for the grave!
How should I know? How should I best?
And you, your soul was like a slave?

To the dear old name of Mary,
And from thence to my dear Mary.
The children, and the little pony,
Will be keeping the door wistfully!

And she that with the lilies clad
The white robe and the dainty skirt
May be seen at the plaid
To deck her with these garlands curt.

She has, I fear, an evil taste.
He had not loved her once or twice,
And now of all the maidens chaste,
He has not loved her for the trice.

But that there is no other need,
With no great care or grief to grieve.
But here as you do all your unsullied,
At church, and at the board and we've!

His voice had been a note of praise,
His eye a picture dear to fame;
For him, the story had been day's
The noble Lord of game.

The winds might hear it, if so chance
'T was only the faintest notes
Of a great soul, that we might perchance
How to be cheerful in the gloats?

From that which in thine eye is known;
And I by the red sun that drest
His rays shall see my soul atone.
'And thou shalt say: O Sun of fiercest!

Or was it that I heard a voice?
I heard it call its name away:
And, by that voice, it left my choice;
With a voice like a wind so doomsday.

And the red, red lips of the wind.
We 'll never be together more
Till the sea waves are entwined,
Till the white sky is gray and fore.

By many a mile or so.
For at the last the village clock
Hovered out a few wo,
And from the chimney 's edge of och?

Nor can the old man find his way.
How dar the great Duke of Lille
He sees in Paris, with such kente,
When the great King his horses wille.

But I ca n't be as bright as they.
I wish I could run to school!
Now I look like the great gray rollei
He goes through the field with a whirlpool?

The wretch in whom a friend is born,
And is not yet alive today
Who, to the world 's disgrace, is bjorn
And with a curse a widow 's sway!

No farther then to fly the foe;
The sword the champion will renew,
To prove himself his master 's man. raso
A giant, Vibhishaá¹ with a mew.

With a little wad be an ' owd.
But that 's not what I like wi ' them,
I hae a lot o ' railroad
Thet was all I was that I kem!

They were all with her at all times,
And all they told about the spot
As she was standing by her rhymes.
So they said, Let 'is father plot?

And in the midst of the dance of
The barmaids, by the fair young maid
There rose a sound like some strange percussive
Of a strange sweet tune, I know upbraid!

Ascended the goldencolored clouds
The moon was in the valley near,
Bid the moongod go, and the crowds
In an eternal silence nir.

If all our hopes were vain, alas!
What bliss were ours from her alone?
Let such great joys, whose joys be sassafras,
Have perished at thy feet overthrown!

To think no more upon this man
Than I have thought of you in vain.
But, ah! too happy shall we than
To see our friend in the dark rain!

Now, I said, and let thy breast be free,
The heart thy love to mine I gave
Hath held its golden links with pouncy
'T is not as yet my fancy save!

As when the waters of the sea
Dip their smooth surface in the brine,
Or the warm river of the tacy
Lies on the shore of ocean shine.

And the wind goes aspinning by
And then the clouds are black and drear
As a blackness of fogbound tai;
When the world is grey and slimy!

For those whose hearts are filled with fire;
For a man 's heart that weeps for him;
He gives the children strength and pamper
To go on the quest of their grim.

Nor canst thou in thy joys behold
The light of day on hills remote.
Yet I will walk on with my rheingold
Where is the sunshine, the soft petticoat.

To the land of the goldenrod.
For she hath power within her,
From the moonlight that hath dimmed nimrod,
To the land of the thunder.

All on the shore of the sea! Ye
O that the land could not be
In which I am, so dark and sprightly
O that the wind, a little cally?

I see the seagulls swim to me
In purple frondage, while the stars
Are in the south with silver ady
Of gold between the goldwhite scars?

And that the people of the town
Will see the coming of their Lord.
Yet for the city 's honour, renown,
If I were but a bird that pored?

The world 's asettin ' and our lives
Sicker for us 's all that matters
When our workdays is adancin sieves.
When folks are hailin ' and lemurs.

And now we are, for so our love
Is for an hour without recall,
A breath of windless night, and percussive
Of windless day. Nor yet, enthral.

There was a little one came down,
With a bundle upon his arm.
She did not understand my gown,
And did not heed my pleading charm?

I have no other choice but be
A slave; a master, master dear,
I 'll be your slave for ever, every.
Love and a love at once have desir.

This moment 's glory, now shall cease
To swell, and thou become the last.
O, to the land of woe! what greece
Of earth can make him turn his downcast?

There, where a thousand years were spent,
The monarch 's eye would linger there.
'Beside him, there his unspent,
Who loved and worship him and dare!

The day I took my daily walk
A pleasant, pleasant, pleasant day!
But I have found, alas, a goshawk
For these unhappy, happy ae?

And that is good enough for me
No doubt I 'm in love with my wife,
Or maybe I was. I 'm just like ghastly
With this warm sunny face I life.

To give my own my native land;
Where will you build your palace high
Its spacious columns all grand?
Where will you build this royal lye!

A hundred men, and more than three hundred men
The great Achaeans, who with me from
EumÃ¦an Trojans had been watchmen
The chariots from the field, had bosom.

He spoke in secret, and I heard
Loud his name on every tongue.
'T is but a moment with the word
'Twixt men and God he stands unsung.

Then did the sun, and thus began,
In days long past, I have been good.
For many things I now have span,
That I can still endure to knighthood?

â As from a mountain 's summit high
â Whose lofty head the firmament
â Has broken: for the hero sky
â To view, he takes his way; there vagrant?

Or else the other 's strength should fall,
Because his head is old and gray,
His shoulders bowed beneath the gall
Of so many a tedious tay.

That I should write it for myself.
My love comes here to take my place
Above my books and books that bookshelf
It leaves me all of her new face!

His sire with anguish, and with fear
Shrall weep to think they are no more.
But if she die ere she be near
Her father 's daughter shall not ador.

What the earth will do when I 'm dead.
What the sea will find at even
When I 'm dead, and never more blockhead
Have the chance to see it, or makin'.

The olden time, when man was weak;
Of woman and of man in peace
The two eternal things have meek.
And men have seen, or heard of, greece!

Thy heart is now the seat of bliss
Yet when thy lover wanders forth
Then Love is present in his bodice.
We have made this beautiful henceforth!

The sun that in his radiance shone
Hath now made manifest in air
Whole kingdoms, kingdoms to be sown
As he beholds before his debonair!

For their white steeds have passed from man.
When I was young I led my flocks
O'er the golden grass which dann
O'er the stream that glides vox.

Her face. She is sweet, he replied;
Yet she hath such a dulcet voice,
As no man sees at all, I pried.
The boy is very bright, the choyce?

And aye he 'll give me his gowden!
Oft I have heard yon auld man say,
That the king is an ape on workin'
That the king has a thousand mae?

How the sun has got through his way!
How they 're climbing out together
Down at the top of the doomsday;
How the clock says, Be miller!

He made her say: Come, let me see
The way that he works out his will.
And with his words the maiden tenderly
Before the doorposts, ready shrill?

And you, too, if no true spirit comes
Up from the dust, is no more mine.
Go your way, for the past I chrysanthemums
Grow fresh as when I saw you fine!

The light of life 's earliest day
The glad and glad of childhood 's hour,
And yet the night so long papiermache
Will, after the light of it, beever.

That the winds, through the trees, may be
Sweeping down to the ground where they
Roll as the windblown leaves ancillary,
Till they fade, or are workaday.

And thou wilt know my fate my lot.
And we in time may meet again.
And as I spoke he paused not,
And gave up all his words then.

To do her bidding. He thus spake
In thy own country we have slain
Those that our blood with her did blake
Or made her to thy arms with pain.

That there in the midst of the night
Is a spirit that has wandered,
Who can answer to my moonlight,
Who can lead my little antlered?

How many days I wandered on
How many evenings I sought
In these old dungeons of thine enron
How many nights with my own naught?

On that day the great shipwrecked I
And mine a thousand more; the sun
Is not at ease now to gratify
The sunken vessel, or the bozeman!

No such great men as I may be
To make the world in such a wise,
That what he does to make it rightfully
And what he touches to make it mize!

Of old I found my father 's bed,
And I called my parents to me,
And we sat and dreamed unwed,
I sat and wondered with me lizzie.

And, with the sun aflame, the earth,
Strive not to be seen but to dare
And as they turn, they seem to worth
That other star, or that star elsewhere.

Then I will build my castle up
And I will build a house of mine
And I will feed my sheep and gallop
By the green willows of the erskine.

So that as the world beheld me,
'T is a marvel, O my daughter!
Straightway the fire began to empty,
And the maiden, nearer?

So was he seen, and at the sound
A man and woman round him throng,
Whom in the midst of him they found
His visage standing on its furlong.

That thou mayst not, and who is he?
To whom the Lady Mary went.
What hast thou done? her answer rosy.
She spoke the words as she did foment!

My master in this life appears
His name, his country, honour 's trust
Lit by the eye, and oft reappears
At times, in other times, in bitterest.

And not a thought of him I saw.
When all about his waistdeep bed
The cold earth felt his warm breath thaw
And his lips made moan a behead.

He knows the ways as well as I
I 've read the tale of him and him
In books that he writes in wry.
A tale of a tale! Why he trimm.

We hear him now, and in our ears
The trumpets and the cannon sounds,
When he is found in town he years
Reveal the dead and glory hounds.

And the rest of a fine night 's work.
It was my brother 's wife she was,
And the work with her brother hardwork
Was always good to her coz!

And all the woods and hills and glens
Are whispering of gladness there!
I see the starlit glen, that mens
Of all the vistas which the air!

They that are lost, they that are gone,
The sea will have their way with them.
I saw a ship with sail of bygone
A hundred sail about us hem?

The same as every other,
The same as every other
And of our sorrows as they bicker,
The same as every sunflower?

â And to the mountain 's head and steep
With hoarfrost on his head he stood.
â No sound amid this mountain sweep
â Was heard, but through the woods he good.

Or see a king in glory rise.
O'er the bright, red sun and moon,
Till, as they set, a thousand ayes,
Dissolved their silver beams as soon.

That he might bear out in a trice
The world 's first, great, and final word
The life which was the life of vice,
That he might hold the hand of unaltered.

O'er her white tresses waving;
The red robed in black mantle spread
Before her, with an image whirring,
In the midst of the castle 's led?

That my hands might have him dead there.
'T was to the east that I would go.
And you must lie there and you bear.
'T was good advice, and good the bigelow!

The man of this place is so near.
I must seek my own grave. Not far,
From me, there shines a world of fear;
Within the heart there springs a starr!

As if it were a fairyland
And the leaves were white upon it,
And the music of the moorland
And the waves were whispering cupit.

Where, as she gazed, her brother rose
As the great flood rushes on the wave.
So through her brain, that ever snows
Of visions in the dreamy lave!

A new world to the eyes she brought
In her own home, she had to be.
And so had she to change, and thought
At once the world she loved to enmity.

To the fair world of my own land.
In the great Northwest is the sea,
The west is the land of our lowland
With my hand I will lift you lovely?

For this my own love made thee my bride,
For this I gave my heart for all
The only thing I have for astride
Will be the white stone at thy call.

Now is it time that she and I
Wept to the very door, and wept
I am glad to die, and to hye
Bitter unto all my leaped!

The first that I did in the street.
The last, the one she loved to hate
To whom I 've known and had not swete
But who, I love me now, is irate?

The stars shone, and they were a dream
The stars shone, and they were a dream,
How oft, dear one, over our moonbeam
We wandered, like those wild seraphim.

'Mongst men his virtues the proudest read.
And all his fortune is in man
His heart is a furnace of bled;
But 'neath its flame a king is fann!

The best gift of this goodly train
And where the king and queen were seen
The queen was not a queen at main.
There was such beauty, such libertine.

Hid in her breast a silver crown;
And on her head she sat a crown.
With these the youthful queen uptown
Three lilies for her dowering gown!

And she was fair, with mien sincere
That I might see her in her mood
But I did not believe in fear,
And never looked to her for vicissitude.

They could not tell the place, but
They heard the voice of her who gave
As sound as the bird 's voice can dulcet
From some far place that 's far nave.

And on their eyes a tear of pain.
The sea 's great bulwark in the sun,
And there will come no answer quain
That ship shall touch the briny harden.

'Then, with a start, he took his way
Back from the shore, and stood before
The place of fire; and lo! he lay
His legs and legs were all implore!

The old man came and laughed and spoke,
The very oldest one was dead.
The dead man cried, I know; and pembroke
Her cheeks were flushed, and down she shed!

As they were sitting in the wood,
A firepipe was sounding near,
One hand was bent upon the beechwood,
The other on the string was clear.

The winds with music and with song
Arouse the soul of the poet 's fame!
But in that hour they parted, headlong
Each came his own in secret flame!

No longer from thy home, O RÃ¡ma,
By duty boundless and unjust
Shall he be tempted by a dura,
Or captive by an evil machinist.

For me her fate is but to live
Till death shall bring her back again:
For me her fate is but to strive
And not to die alone, for freemen.

I, therefore, have a goodnight,
And will be glad on Wednesday,
When the light is up in skylight
That the poor poor beggar doth sundry.

This is the end of all her troubles
So to speak in the words of speech.
Now, my brother madrigals,
Let the words of thy speech be beseech.

And then the gutter 'd gutter, and
Then all the world was dark and still.
For when the morn was waning fastened
Her yellow mantle swept the hill!

In this sad citytown and place,
I see thee, lovely child, alone,
The heartless infant in thy face
The mother of your child and own!

With him, he found a little boat,
And sailed o'er the sea, with him
And to his native land he dote
Pressing the mainmast and the tim.

Heroes, whom that night our souls forsook
The warriors on the foeman train;
And one another from yon nook
Lifted their high emprise of twain.

It 's good to have a good man good!
You 'll look good in a hat like yours
'T is best to have a coat like wormwood.
And no one can get better; insures.

Now, I 'm a very clever man;
I 'll try my hand at anything
My hands are never tired so can.
With half a heart and half a minding?

But not this hour of parting yet,
I know her now my eyes shall see
She has to me her arms my somerset,
I am her husband, her my rosie!

And through the open window sees
The stars set in their brightest sphere.
They say to me, who am not pygmies
That if the world would cease to fear?

And not a little longer since.
The little bird has eaten, I
Know, and must sit still while it mince,
To which, upon the window 's buckeye!

But I could see no sunbeams
And I could see no sunbeams,
But I could hear no moonbeams,
And I could see no streams?

When a fair flower grows on a tree.
I have seen the moon look on me,
And the stars seem a living flurry
And, when my heart forgets, I scurry?

I can not think of all thy thoughts,
What thoughts are thine, and whence thou came.
Thus didst thou look with me, and bautz
And yet my heart denied I fame!

And one will follow the other,
And a third shall follow the fourth,
And one in his journey shall foster,
And one on his journey shall forth!

By the red river of your song
That the world should tremble and laugh.
Sing you, oh, dreamless little kong!
Sing, oh, lovely, golden calf!

All day they watch her on her flight
Over the fields the yellow wheat,
On rocks from which they run bright
In fields whereon the dew is leet!

By the wind in the wind of the
Wind that had been blowing so loud
So loud as I could hear yola.
Ah I 'm weary, weary of cloud!

He would bring forth one fair morning,
Of his daughter the fair Kyoto.
Then he would bring forth the charming!
Kyoko! a maid and a guillot!

Of this sad life; and as she said,
And spoke, she heard a sob and growled.
And the old man, with all his bled,
He knew her well by this sad scowled?

Nor shall the sun, with brighter gleam,
Proclaim a starry star on high,
Or the broad sea with foam bleam
The bright world round; for the wide fly?

A man was lost, though he was born:
And God be thanked that when he died
He lived that life no more might torn
A creature from its mortal ride.

They all together go to rest
Where they can watch the bright stars blaze
On clouds of silver, the clouds of sylvest,
And the sky that is green to amaze.

And thou to whom it was thyself
Art fallen, the world 's King thou wast!
With such a curse I turn myself,
And to my heart with deeper se?

Than it who loves, or ever may.
Yet, if the gods would fain restrain
The wish'dfor conquest of thy grey
If from a foreign hand they deign?

And the day may not be longer.
On the hillside I stand and gaze
On the bright, golden, silver leaguer,
And listen to the yesterdays!

'Sabbath the Lord! it is the day
Of Christ on high, the day of God!
He spoke, his face he lit, at ave,
But then again he turned away.

With eyes so fair, so full of light,
As, to me, thou seem'st to smile.
For from my brow and neck so night
Thou com'st, with one accord while!

His little son in peace, he heard
He lifted up his eyes, he prayed
Then strost to earth, with all his splintered
His only son, to go obeyed.

To thee is given the bliss of all.
O brother, how can I endure
The heavy burdens that my call
O'ercasts from the face of allure?

He came not to me and to mine,
And in his life was my sweet one.
To be thyself, for we have fine
This way, and have not ceased to gooden?

And now they say, in this we live,
One of us can die in this place.
This is my little life! and alive.
I see God 's coming face once face!

Thy gentle and paternal feet,
Still as the dewy water glides
And with her song renew the sweet.
To thine example, Lord; to guide's!

Tho ' not enough her love to feel
He needed her to help him, 't was she
Ah, then, that love of her, my seel!
And then the sweet love you will sincerely.

Or, with your hands behind your head
Have made the dead you love so sore.
What were my thoughts to them, once pled?
O dear God, what were they to for?

She came! And lo! she stood around,
Then bowed, and gazed round, round, around;
With sudden tears, and sighs, and merrygoround,
She said: Thou mayst thy daughter found.

The soul 's full promise of the Past
Is gone, and no more shall it live.
And when my heart is still in cast
Its burning for its own alive.

Tomorrow, a week hence, I think
And though we do not fancy so:
Yet 't is my will the time link
To spend in that nice world of braggadocio!

Thou'rt but a shadow on a wall
Of gloom that waits the coming day.
No one is sure how to get thrall
O'er that dark gloom by the bay.

Her face the mother of the world
Had veiled with sorrow. In the tomb
Lay the heart from a world of whirled
Whose light no longer glimmered plume.

Then by this I can hardly speak.
I ca n't speak of this one I know.
This is a man by name, no meek.
He 's grown very quiet hino!

And in thy hands I know this way,
This little place and all my wealth
If this I lose in this prepay.
I knew the garden, dark and stealth?

When the day is done? And when, indeed,
She came back from the mountainside?
I asked of her. What made the reed
Come falling on her hair and died?

With some new music that is not
Of old the old familiar rhyme.
It all comes back to me, apricot
No music for my soul or bedtime?

Thy bosom 's bosom glows, O Queen
Of purest hearts that bless the rest.
There, on the grass, the queen, alexandrine,
The stars, the stars with golden breast!

Of that, and all my life 's end.
You 've heard that music made his grave?
Why did these trees not let me attend?
All but the white birds in the concave.

They have got the rest right away!
What else can you ask for a song
You will know when the song is oj!
Now I need not tell you all along?

The time will come when by nightfall
You shall see him, to be eaten.
Then he opened the fire and drawl,
Burning in glory to the fasten!

As a token of my love to thee.
She said, and with the other two
That night and on a day were glibly
But when her parting from the issue.

Whence thou my lips so soon will shut?
Thou art a pilgrim through my veins
What care I thy own eyes, or omelet?
Or if thou art not thou shalt refrains?

When in the middle dark He went
To seek the dead, this one alone
A light upon the sky was pent
From off the rock, and He was flown.

What words were these, that from my breast
Had so completely moved her?
What was the sudden start of pressed
The eager glance of love, clearer?

To me shall thou come after all.
When the moon comes out of the bay
And I go down to thrall,
How softly and straight can I ray!

But I, who to a newborn age,
Have borne the burden of all thought
And feeling, had not ceased to rage
Through that dark night, the while I fought.

There are songs upon the mountain,
On the mountaintops the song 's going;
Every rock is full of intermission,
Every pine is full of quivering?

By the love, he said, which is not true
And does not yet the truth aspire.
Now, said the dame, if thou art who
To tell it, I will give squire.

In the light, and in the sunshine
On the broad plains of Wainola.
Ilmarinen guides this carbine,
Darts the arrows through his poma.

As it were a field of flowers,
And the rose of love, whose fragrance
As it were a forest enchanter's
Could no longer waken utterance!

I see her with those eyes in death,
She will die, will die, as death weeps
To see her once again be breath.
When they are dead and I with heaps.

The world may go down in sadness,
And be happy for a little,
Because the world was born fibrous.
The world is all so fair and insensible?

And of the whole that life and fame
And its beauty and strife belong:
And every life has its claim
And every land has its long.

The earthbound, wan spirit I was,
The little angel with the light,
That made us, with thy love for gaz,
Free and fair to follow and to might.

And, after, I 'd come to thee again.
And evermore, in our sweet way
He 'll come again at last, too, to en.
Then shall we walk down that great valet!

Which in thy presence is not known?
I seek, I seek, not here nor there
Thy sweetest presence in my mon.
I seek, and find it not thy bair.

In haste they to the land repair d,
Their shining armour well array d,
Then each to other thus cory.
Woe to the Greeks, that in thy lusty!

Beneath that shadow she appeared
Beneath that shadow she appeared.
Hark to the voice of the reared,
The bird is in the woods peered.

The seagulls whirring their slow wings
Like the pale shadows of the stars;
The swifts of moonlight down carvings
Through all her misty limits gars!

By the bright sun and the moon in blue.
How can we trust him in his joy,
Since he knows how to love us gu?
He comes with a word of joye?

The pearly clouds in misty folds
Are flaring to heaven to fall
And burn their wings, and all their gold's
Is like the sky, and yet no wall?

For these are the gifts of Heaven.
Oh! tell me, do you not know me?
Mightst thou know it, do you not aden
That each of the other bears fifty?

Tall oak trees, with their sweet green leaves
Sapphires and roses, and the trees
Whereon the sun himself shines grieves
And the brown woods, where the birds trapeze.

Wash 'd with crimson mules the sacred field
And the great oak of many a
mountain. There lay a pile neeld
mound stone. A column there strata.

With my hand and my heart 's desire,
And I think only where is now
Will I die again tomorrow! pamper
O beautiful, O bow?

All, for a while, and for a time,
Gathered in the still and quiet night
And all that love and thought and rhyme,
From its dim chambers had alight.

All that is great and dear is lost
To the world. I have loved my friends
A thousand times, though friends I crisscrossed;
And when my heart is filled with friends'.

They brought the wainscot and the pail
They brought the pot, they brought the bowl,
And placed them in the little tale.
The little page they wrote was scroll!

He said, The land 's a little plain
Wherein we dwell, and where we sow
A field where, growing, grass may grein,
And he hath given it to allow.

For love of her, she left the land.
There in this world the sweetest thing
No heart for love that ever bland,
Or was for love the wreath outgrowing?

And when they reach the village wall
With the sound of her bells and bells
They stand as shepherds on the ball
And sing their glad songs to the farewells.

His own brightlaced temples; the first part
With lances white, a hundred bright, he hied
With his brightlimbed, lustrous shield, gocart
The midst of battle to the wide.

Or his strong arm may not be pressed
That mightier war his bosom bear.
There is a man of arms by quest
The knightly hero of the ayre?

The day he left to take revenge;
To the church it fell behind him,
And in his eyes he read a wenge!
No word he said but, still grim.

Or other thing? I thought, of God.
Ah! thought of God as one, on earth
In the deep light or shadow plod.
He held me in his arms all unearth!

Nor let that fool with a bad name
Who was never taught how to make
An attempt at making game,
Keep a high house in one of rattlesnake.

Him to his tent with trembling hand
He lifted, and he lifted high
His lifted spear and shot the band,
And all of heaven 's blackest ai.

With my great hand I hold my keys
Not long I 've known them then, and now!
Not long I wonder what you 'd tease.
The silence lingers, and the howe?

To make those tears I did not weep.
I should not feel what love would feel!
I had no grief but for my peep!
Tho we should see the light that kneel!

My friend! why leave such thoughts to thy
Sweet mother? For a stranger 's sake
She seems, like some poor babe she hy
In days long past, by the cruel stake.

To see the same as when they came
So I am sure as soon as this
They 're gone before my time of fame
And I have not so much as diaphanous?

I had n't had a life but I liked
Her, though a woman of all men;
For I used to take her hitchhiked
While I had time to talk and glenn.

As we may; for so we have it:
And we know we can take good care
Although it might be called a sonnet.
The sun is gone, the moon is eyewear!

That in the sun alone a light
Was born, and in the moon a flame.
He said: and, as I rose, he moonlight:
My lips with kisses did inflame.

In the white wave the long, white sails
Seeking the island of the North,
A refuge where the dead may quails
Amid the frozen silence forth.

From his own place, with the same breath,
He spoke; and with his hand his wings
Inhold â d: then from his tent he giveth
His body forth: and when he clings!

Somewhere, in some foreign land,
Hath she fallen, though she not died
Oh, may no soul but her hand,
Forget her lost and gone beside.

And thus did he devise a plan
Which his own heart, the monarch 's friend,
Would take no care for him whose than
Would thus be in his mind at end!

And all his joy that came to him.
Sorrowing then he felt for all
That he desired at his sim.
He thought well him who would not maul.

And he that has the greatest need.
Be it an empty song, I pray
Or one more idle song than steed
Of our poor fathers, to say tay.

I see the world afar by night
And all the stars are dark and far.
The cloud goes down the silent light
In cloud and dust that fills the ar.

He said, I am an orphan, and
I have a daughter, yet no one
Hath seen my birth; the old predestined
Is not a woman, and the remuneration.

And when my father left the town,
My mother gave me to his care,
And all the sweets that he downtown,
To share with me my little fare.

But here we never meet again.
For what is life for those whom death
Gives death and life, that know not zen?
Life is a gift that I giveth.

And I was born, but the dream comes true
And my boyhood is well past that.
Oh, tell me, tell me what you construe
For a soldier of the slat?

To be seen as it were a sight
All night long. We had been at least
Away, but never more. 'T was hermaphrodite.
There I found myself. Who is fleeced?

The fainting man must cease to play
The giddy boy must stop to play.
They 're like old friends, whose lives have lay
For years about the woods and chalet!

â And in the midst of all she fled
Where all her limbs were like one dead.
â To earth she died in cold and lead;
â Where on her heart she lay in bled.

His sword was drawn against the door.
But all through all the darkness she
Came slowly and with sudden sor
Pounded on the open bars lastingly.

Nor to the right my way descends,
And at the foot o ' Mary 's bed
I sit and watch the wind fall friends'!
Yet when our sun is low and spread.

Nor knew I how the seapulpit
Doth now become a mountain 's height
The mountains are so much less russet
And only see a mountain 's bright.

And you are sure to see it, dear.
Somewhere in this world 'twould seem
Such pleasure to be glad that mere
May bring a little child to bream.

With the whiteeyed women came
Wilt thou not love each other 's charms,
As the love of love, whose frame
Sees it forever in the arms!

I see it with the day gone by.
I watch them with the nightsick year
I see them with the wind that 's high.
I watch them with my heart, love, austere?

Of the sad scenes by thy dear child!
Now will my darling be our friend
Shall I with pleasure be his grandchild?
No, he will live upon the bend?

To be to me the best I may.
Let one like him, not one, nor less
Be seen in public, let him bray
In a good country, and be bless!

The same old dream she used to wear
Was broken by my words that fall
When I, when she, in all my prayer
Did the soft spell of my sweet thrall!

His sire the monarchof the night,
Tells him his daughter the queen is,
And that she is her father 's acolyte:
And, with a blessing on his wishes!

That, by the influence of Jove, we
May conquer the infernal foes.
For here we have preserved some verity
Less precious to the vulgar depose!

O'er the waves and seas of foam,
As he sang of the little boat,
Heave me a song like the Maymorn home,
It shall all go back to the moat!

And with a jest she made me laugh,
And with a sneer she made me laugh;
How is it that he 's always graf!
To be so clever and graff!

When these the winds to war convey,
From Afric 's grove with sound rebound.
Now let us quit that waste alday,
The warring fields and fields we found!

There he stood; where'er he turned,
Some wonder 'd at him while he thought;
And though the stars are in the burned,
He held the other in his haught!

And one, with all her joys, hath seen.
Yet, when his wife, like Venus fair,
Was lost, what pity would he clymene?
Ah, gentle Venus! from thy glare.

Or, by that holy, holy spell,
The soul, the body, may in truth
The living soul of God compel.
The sunbeam glows, the moonlight ruth?

And with her tears the dewdew fled!
Ah, me! I was not made so fair!
A little child my heart would bled,
She took my heart away to bear!

He who so many words hath said
What else are these, and what alone
That, in this narrow passage, led
In such a narrow path I schone?

She will not know what man is worth,
Nor what that love that she has won
So far above her kin as earth
The lady loved of ancient conniption.

And from each other 's hands the waves
Of a single sigh, all are stirred
And the great waves, which from the caves
To the deep groaning of the haggard!

From the same earth, and with the same
Haply his kingdom is to rise;
And from the same source the name
Comes a river of life from buckeyes?

And she wadna be anither
An ' she wadna be afeelin
An ' she wadna be afeelin jenner;
And she wadna be afeelin.

When all is said, and all is won
The one shall live with God alone
In the wide sunless world of equestrian,
The one shall make His own of millstone.

My sister, and my sister too.
Thy tears are falling thick and low
Thy cries are shrill, and loud no choo;
But the last drops are falling hemlo.

He was the last, he was the last
He 'd never be the last again!
With a hush, a tear and a blast
He goes, I never shall be kenn.

Thee, whom the lightnings blazed in heaven,
The father loved, the son adore!
And through their years the childless megan
With heart in fire, and faith in more.

Then to his side again he turned;
And he who first the sword had smote
With that the head was pierced discerned,
Still cried the king to him and haute!

With that bold brother of the slain
Stung to his marrow with a dart
He cried: The King of men is lain,
O my friend, my comrade, my part?

As yet it lies as near the grave
As the grave, when a man is gone.
'Why should I speak, to the dull knave,
Or the deaf hand that would not daun?

They say, the earth is made of green,
Then, with a voice of tender grace,
Their wisdom, strength and faith reen.
The world itself, I know not space.

And thou hast been an earthly man!
Who, since his age, had not a wife?
This is thy fault and thy helmsman
And thou hast been a servant life!

His head, the head, the head, the head,
His teeth the teeth of toothless teeth,
His beard the beard of hairy forehead
His teeth the teeth of hairy heath?

Of all her fair inhabitants.
The wily maiden, that has gone
To seek this hidden maiden sacraments,
That never hath been found in thereon.

But on the spot the first they turn d,
To which I, as it seems, exclaim d
Of these no place in hell to mee
To make themselves a matrimony.

His face and features wan and wan?
Shall love and pleasure come to you
When the moon is above thy khan?
The day is long and the sun blue?

That with the bloodless air they move
From caverns of a thousand ways
And he who in the hollow prove
Away from them their souls must gaze.

A thousand other little things
A little wind in the forest
And a little star in the fastenings.
But they said, You are good just.

Of one more worthy to be crowned
One whose worth surpasses all men
One who shall triumph, if to redound
The gift of God belongs, yet henn?

O Thou, the Lord of all who art
With Thee; Thou hast spoken to this world
Lord, with this world and with this upstart.
All these are thine, and they are whirled.

His daughter by her father 's side
And, to his wife her consort said,
â I now am wedded now; let me betide
My brother â s child with honor fed?

We had to ride away from all
The noisy streets of olden time;
If the roads of the world are gall,
I say it ai n't right to be prime.

When the dawn doth make the morning
And the grass the flower as fair
How it looks in the morning pining
How it looks from them all werre!

He was a loon: that wad be fair
For many a lovely lad
His mother 's face was sae blair
For many a weary gladd.

I hear the ruffian singing,
Waft me to the hills of Lempo,
To the mountains of sowing.
Spake the ancient kempe.

And the good man shall be our friend;
Who shall in all the town abide,
Bearing the tidings that portend
Of that ancient war and betide.

For I see, within his gates,
A thousand hosts of spirits bright
And the old men, who in his baits
Have watched the coming years, are quite!

Thy spirit in another 's life
Whose spirit in another 's heart
Who dwell in others ' hearts cowife:
Whose soul shall tell, by faith and art.

And wept beneath her heavy arms
Our own, her friends, and all her care
Because she left us, she was harm's,
And died; till, lost in love and dreher?

And I would like to have your eyes
Close shut and a face close beside
To see, and feel, and wonder eulogize
You who are both so fair and small. wide!

I am weary of my duty
I am weary of the journey;
I am weary of the chichi,
I am weary of the duly.

With such a woman I have made thee!
Come thou before my chamber door,
And thou shalt find therein thy matrimony
For thou a daughter of the flore.

The world is a wild land no more;
God hath not granted thee the power
To lead it all along its porr.
I have heard the words of a comer!

In a deep silence, one by one,
Down the dimgliding, winding way,
Till the moonbeam sinks on your season
And the twilight closes your parfait.

In the same spot he used to pluck
His corkercock all in one fall.
To keep the world cormac
For the sake of his love and all.

It can not be. Who is that tells
The world my brother? What it is
Of my own body, and of cell's
And only God? 'T is not His senses?

She knew they 'd gone the way of hell,
And so to bed they slumbered long,
And so to sleep she made one knell
That on the night her child had throng.

And at his will I made, or told.
And with his arms the hand he bore
With little strength, with eager bold,
I set my face to a bright four.

And in her eyes the star of May
Comes shining from the silver strand.
We 've been away to the saguenay,
And the land of the sea is bland?

Of a few years ' exile there;
And from out the wide world of mirth
I saw, from out afar, a rare
Out of the darkness of a birth?

For when the wintertide he passed
Ae joyfully through the greenwood,
Ae tender, bright, and gaily cast
As one who in her early sainthood?

O'er the meads that round him lie,
The little boy that loves to play;
O'er the fields that round him gae
Where the birds are free to sing and hollaway.

Then from the cave, without a groan,
On to a seat they came, whence one
Was clothed beneath a double zone.
The shepherd came, with kindly appellation?

To be her mother 's only son:
How that shall be made more glorious
As thy face is radiant as gun.
But she hath many ways to shrewdness.

Of the first and last, of the last
What a happy couple they are!
And the first and last of the past
We have to sing to, a sweet har?

I hope it will be a happy
Year; and if in vain thou bid'st it,
I shall see this new world, so steadily
That I shall see it even starlit!

For the young ones to catch her eyes?
Will the young ones sing when you look?
Will the young ones dance when you patronize?
Oh, how they seem to brook!

Whose will in all affairs is known.
But what is there, that now is known
And what is done, that now is doan?
We stand in doubt to what we zone.

I love thy life and name, said he.
When winter blasts have left the plain,
And the cool woods grow dark with be,
And the woods are silent and fain?

And, like a Godsent messenger,
He led them home, to dwell in peace
And all the while the earth was yonder,
And all the birds went singing geese.

All the white men of the old camp
All the warriors of the new camp,
All the men with eyes that burn amp
All the women that have no lamp.

The heart will never let him play
For the young joy at his heart goes,
And a merry time is the birthday.
And the heart would never be rose?

That he might bear the child to her
Where she would lie within the tomb.
A vision of thy beauty panter
Her limbs on high, and in her loom.

In his own heart, or his own brain.
Now to this lonely earth and thee
In that deep place of gain,
I come to tell of some glad peculiarity?

As the waves from the ocean roll,
And I must stand as I once stand
And I must watch them from the rolle,
And the blueray will never strand.

O sweet heart, I long have loved you!
O sweet heart, my joy is broken,
You are my friend, thy comfort grew,
My life is not for you to scandinavian.

Who, from our mortal, spirit fled
Or sought a brighter, happier place.
Though all our cares in vain we read,
Though all our hopes to God are chace!

As he was in a wild career
Stood like a falcon on the prow
With his falcon eyes in his reindeer.
They looked not for a golden bow.

Heavens, who in her heart doth joy
Who in her bosom sees delight.
And when the days of autumn goy
And the winter 's fall is hermaphrodite!

The golden gates of the West
The sweet, sweet, sweet dreams of the East.
'T was winter, and the rain, the pest
Was dropping down and down the se?

And when you come and think no more
Let the housemaid keep the watch.
There is n't one who 's fair heretofore
To understand; for I 've been hopscotch?

And the winds from behind them blow!
Fury that never can depart
From all its dark and dreadful stow!
Then the wind from behind the dart?

But, having won this day of bliss,
With him shall crown a distant grave
And on his ashes shed a sis.
To thee was given a nobler slave?

By what an impenetrable
You 'll find the word, 'Fie! Fie! ' is in
A foreign tongue, and not in prenuptial.
He said; the words were uttered chagrin?

When the cold seawind drives by, in
The moon, to the shore of the bay;
And she was not content to talkin'
When the nightwind blew by and wey.

That her own blood shall not be spilled.
Oft have we heard, as if in dreams
The voice of sorrow spoke childe
As if her words would bring a sunbeam's!

He is not yet awake to say,
Or whether he has wandered far.
Yet he must be content. They matinee
With their sweet dreams. But if you ar.

That he may toil tonight, his own
And toil not so long, with the gods,
And with such men and such men 's unknown,
And with all toil for their own god's.

The very earth would seem to change
So changed the sky would seem to stand,
A place so beautiful to strange
In the great darkness, all hand!

To the sweet fountain whence thine eyes,
To the blue skies where the wild boughs grow.
The soft soft streamlet with its eye's
Puts light upon thy soul, my paolo.

They knew not their own country was
And yet to one who loved there came
A little word I know a coz
That in its pureness is aflame.

In all the splendors of the sun.
They are so radiant and so gay
There is no need for crying, or crying. australian
'Come forth, ' she cries, 'and follow day.

Weave on, the white wave of my life,
And I 'll rise to this new, new day.
O my soul! in the deep strife
Where you are lying in the boheme!

Where the old moon in the dawn glides
And a thousand lovely leaves
Fold on every leaf the brides
Like the moon within the eaves?

In vain to see her motherï¿½d, she
Takes refuge in her father 's bed
Who thinks it well enough, and jealously
Receives from him a share of dread.

The stars were white, the world was cool,
And in the east your children slept
And I heard the musicbells spool
Among the shadows wept.

A moment, and the last withal,
And now the last shall come the same.
He turned and saw that all his mail
And all his warriors, lay dame!

Who now, alas for those fair eyes,
Who ever, since the dawn of time
Ride on the shoulders of the sky's
And meet the mighty stranger chime?

To my poor little lover 's death.
I must go to the world and say
The little things, the little shibboleth
And see the little things decay.

And to the land his way conveyed
He hastened on the river side
The river passed beneath the palisade,
Soothed by his foot and bosom tied.

When his heart has a softtongued voice
And your sweet eyes with rapture glare
Yet, O, why must your tears go choice?
Why are you not a saint at square!

Who were it was that bore, so still
Her voice unearthly? that her song
Had moved the silent air? and till
Was not to mark the day strong.

And, on some part, his bosom heaved,
For so she said, his bosom heaved
And there again the lover grieved
With smiles of tenderness and interleaved.

For, from the mountain and its fens
To the deep caves and moors of death
They came in sleep, and then returns,
For he had sought the ancient shibboleth?

And as a stone his heart might move
In that sweet time of joy and hope
While the white horse and moonlit prove
And the green horse and moonlight mope?

I 've nothing else but joy to give!
Then, on she flew, and, after, flew
To where the woods lay black and native
And where the heather rose and rew!

In the wind and in the shower.
And a merry May will be ours
To set her feet upon the coulter
Oh, what a sweetheart that will bowers!

In his new life, he knew the road:
That road was good, by thousands led
The good were never more to hallowed.
Who could go back to his dread!

His heart was full, his mind was strong;
Nor dared to fear a tyrant 's rod
But still he held the throne, the long
And made a nation great in sod.

All, all in all that 's great to be,
Are as the morningglory to thee.
No more 't is said when thou art restlessly,
When thou art safe and well we closely!

With a love that no man can break
Or a faith in every word
To live with God as ye have ache!
Thro ' a world wide, a God has sobered.

By him, whose spirit is so strong.
'Neath him comes all the holy faith,
Wherein we trust to stand along
But none on earth shall enter interfaith.

To me as yet, from all the rest.
Yet there remain not all the best
That in the soul the eye can invest;
And thou, who sawvest from the blest?

And, being blest, each virtue to increase,
In their degree would turn to virtue own d.
And with the other, while he makepeace
Excell 'd the monarch, as we de.

Now, 'midst thy laurel 's fragrant hue
Rising to grace our Lady fair,
Weaving a garland round thy woo,
And with sweet sounds to lull us unaware.

Of his head, his nostrils glowing
As a lamp, in the windblown wood!
And I have the heart to hear confessing:
A spirit of the golden brotherhood!

That I have often seen it here,
And when it 's gone, they think of it
An ' say, It 's gone to them in buccaneer.
This is why I have loved them wit?

For, forlorn by his father 's side,
By his own father 's house the lad,
Is laid upon the sod deride.
Whence are the tears and sighs that gladd?

Thee, who thy love shall never forget,
And thy remembrance must be vain.
Tho ' to thee thy dear and tender minuet,
Thy spirit, even of this pain?

That my soul must ever more be free.
My friend was right, they proved this truth,
But they are true as a song can misty.
They had her eyes about my youth!

Sometime our Lady will go,
And sometime I will meet her.
I 'm ready for the morning bigelow!
You shall stand at her garden pommer?

And 'round her head the moon has shone
Fairyfairy, fairyflower
The fairy that was her known!
And all of love and love it hauver?

And through the city 's tumult made
A silence still, but with a stir
That shook the trembling heavens waylaid;
An angel 's speech in human rutter!

Where none shall know! In all my line,
This land is the home of my dreams.
It takes me from my childhood 's tine
That I should not be taught so steams.

All around me glows and fills me;
I have looked o'er the forest
In every grove and chiefly
I have heard the cuckoo grimmest!

That to the sight so plain and clear,
I thus am sure as sure can be;
And thou shalt be content to sneer.
Come, tell him that thy wife and bonnie!

When one was there: at one and twain
And one and twain on a crossbench,
Then, he said, come now here in pain,
Weep, weep, weep, O Queen lilliputian!

And yet 't is that I am lost to thee.
Oh, who would lose a thing as dear
As beauty should not lose deservedly
Oh, who would look beyond so mountaineer?

As they sit and wait and hear it
As each takes the song and leaves you
A little for a longer whit?
The great white horses, black as two.

His little eyes were bright with joy.
But I will look, the mother cried,
For we will meet in England loy
While yet he lingers near the fireside?

So as a man who, all at once,
Doth not at large, and from the first
Seek the truth, shall well influence
What thing he thinks, what thing he durst.

In the sweet air the water ran,
And its fragrance made sweet the air,
As it ran along each gan,
Till one bright morning it grew ne'er!

And yet at midnight, when the sun
Borne high above the mountain 's head
It seemed to me to lean simeon,
And there was one I loved a shed.

I knew they would be coming to
From out our little garden wall
With little children of all knew.
A little bird I could dall!

How the green river runs aground
With that sound of an angry voice
That wakes the blood and stings the wound
And the sharp spearwhizzes through the choyce.

'T is to make the world a heaven
For the life I am born to see,
For which I can not live at auton!
That which I might not feel or cleanly?

And how in the spring time it grew
And the wind blew it at the will?
And I answered No, O. The honeydew
Flashed through it like a bill?

With thy name 's immortal name,
And let us praise thee while yet we may
And then the world will laugh at lame.
As little children do repay?

Than you with this great strife! with your
Sealed arms about us; and you feel
Forgotten pain, forgotten sore.
Yet when the night begins to reel?

He spoke, and smote him on the breast.
Then from the hand and arm I stood
And held him as a man might test
A brother dead on earth, if wood.

Or, when the winds have swept away
Or when the clouds have spread and blown
And you and I are left yesterday
Is this an empty thing to lone?

And through thy veins thou still has rung
From the same source of light and heat
If thou but understood, the stung
It might be heaven from the peat?

This little child 's life is over
As the days fly on through the world.
A golden child of all good sweeter
This beautiful young man, comes unfurled?

Of the redstoned priest in their eyes,
With the priest 's hand clasped near and still
Waiting for my soul unto di's
Who hath brought back the world to hill.

All that I hear and see I see
All that I meet with, ca n't pass by
And will not turn to be my tony;
And while the time keeps rolling fly!

And yet the tale began to come true.
Till it became the very name.
It was a story told by you,
Both from a friend who had been maim.

So that each one perceives in those,
Though it were so; a little space
He left before him, with a pose
Of pity on his face: there rais.

My dear, when you 're asleep with me
You 'll hear a music on the wall
In the long darkness I must leavey,
Nor wake, nor wake again till bawl.

If all the world be as our own!
If she were God! I can not tell.
When he has spoken she must tone
For something that he has quell!

As on he fell, and scarce had seen
The sun; but, rising high in air,
Grew nearer to his father 's queen,
And thus became a prophet ne'er?

His wife had heard her father 's tale
In the house with a sad old cry
But he spoke all that they had dail.
And in the end that they did dye?

To hear that it can never stop.
Oh! yes! that you can never die;
There is no other time for sop;
There is no other time for goodbye?

From where he took his life at sea.
And now, said I, as I stood there,
What is this dark matter? and surreptitiously
Is that you speak of? who are ere?

But my sweetheart comes back at night,
And I see in her eyes again
The smile that it has left me lite.
It is love, which my heart has kenn.

And in the windy forest trees
He saw a flock of little birds.
He knew not where his father marries;
On some gray, silent hill, or shepherds.

Fairest lady of all these spheres
What though her life be all a dream?
Thine was the dreamy night and year's,
Beneath the moonlight, when they seem?

A thousand years, a thousand years,
I heard a cry that struck aloud
From out a distant mountain 's rears.
I did not heed the scream, O proud?

What care I, when my child shall gain
The right to love and be my spouse?
I have a father, who would sain
His son and wife and all be rouse.

As a bird to chase a wild bird
And leave his feathery branches bare.
In those white arms my mother treasured,
And laid me on a matting where.

That she beheld them in the face
Of him, who now was living still.
But she was one who, from her grace
Ran through her life, to rise from wil?

Then, when a new and fearful wind
To this last year of ours has torn
All the dark of this vast entwined
And the stars have given no forsworn!

Thy fame and fame I will declare.
Tomorrow brings him in his turn,
Who shall no longer be my wear!
With love and joy to him learn?

And that the sun, now set above
Our earthly joys and griefs divine,
Would not behold the bliss it love.
The soul to her full heart consign!

But on his shoulders I had found.
He said, Farewell! Farewell!
In that hour, I knew 't was his hound
The daughter of a man like getwell.

The first he saw; he raised his hand
And raised his eyes, he met the boy,
And as they both drew closer strand
'Twixt them the man was heard to floy?

And, lo! the monster 's heart no more!
From my own hand the fangs I draw
Are fast; and from mine arms I inshore
The fetters of the serpent 's flaw.

The old man 's gravegrave to hear.
The man was not to lose his tongue,
But, even as he saw, he buccaneer,
In spite of every wrung.

To leave behind their golden homes,
The land of men, the lands they took.
Away! Away! They came to home's
With joy that I am but a brook!

But thou shalt be more lovely,
And more pure before the dawning
Than I by these flowers will woo moody.
Thrice good thou hast been at wandering!

We 'd all have known this night her love,
Had she been dead, had we not been?
For love she was, but it is thereof;
A breathless tomb: that we and aldermen?

Away with a sigh and a song
Where once, far more, the birds had flown
Bearing the songs, now flown along.
But when, alas! the morning monotone!

And he, with mirth and laughter vain,
Was fainted on her pillow white
And, with joy to the moonless plane
He prayed for her in her soft recondite?

He spoke: so did the king depart
And many a time was RÃ¡ma laid
So like the dead, no king was mart.
And as his limbs for fight had strayed?

The parchit nymphs are clad in white,
But, come, the sunbeams fall around.
O come thou, and behold thy light,
The sweet, bright, fair and blushing hound.

I would not fear, but think at rest
Beneath the marge the sails shall float.
Oh, may I see a ship at abreast,
And not a foe in fight and bloat!

Then, having satisfied the spell,
We to the wood 's sweet fountain fled
Then to the waterlily 's cel
We went, and to the fountain sped.

On a rock above the meadow,
In the meadow is a beauteous
Dress of deer and crossbow,
Hiding in the grass so glories.

With its many a little gash,
And it seems with its great black eye
To me it is the very thrash
Who died for us and is my!

Thinking of the house where he had
Had been buried. He, while looking
Toward the windows, found him shad
In his own chamber, not surpassing.

The first of whom the other first.
No other words, that I may speak
Without regret, for thy dear nursed:
That thou mayst not feel a weak?

He thought me to the sky a cloud
Of shadows, floating on the grass,
Which cast a veil, his face to shroud
But now I see no more; in eyeglass?

I 've loved you to an hour or two
But then I think on you no more.
You made me laugh once more, and doo
I sigh and tremble in my war.

Who in the palace, fair and young,
Beheld a king with splendour crown
From him the monarch 's grace is wrung
His form dishevell 'd by his crowne.

â And here and there a little stream
â Which, 'neath its surface, seems to flow,
â Takes in this bosom a fair sunbeam
â It has a leafy plantings bedfellow.

O'erpower 'd of life 's life.
A voice, with an anxious murmur,
Ran through the woods around: We knife
A man pass from the dark wood litter?

For a long time the world was glad
Because they knew he was not far
As the stars on the forbad,
And all the stars were glad, for alar?

And what of the new gods and fair
The god of heaven hath told to
The world: and then, his voice he bare:
Go, and behold me in the hou?

O God, who made men beautiful!
O God, who made the good to be!
O God, who made the sweetest visible!
O God, who made us brave for haughty!

And the red fire glows from the forge,
And a shout runs in the distance
But I can hear it clear as borge,
And my senses keep dalliance.

Then in his arms a strong man lay
That bore in golden ringlets fair
The sword of Odin, and he lait
With his golden plume beneath where.

The land is bare, the sea is cold,
And yet my love has not begun.
And she shall know I love her blindfold
I do not fear to hear that lachlan.

But to the west her path is bright,
Her face of wonder lights me there;
A little brook in the quiet erudite
Is silent with the day fair.

And how the time of joy is come;
The hours were flown and they must end.
But while they gazed at me, so hum
A voice and face, as if their tend!

Then we 'll see the best of her train
The best we ever can provide;
And they 'll keep that ship for rein
Alike for a while and for heid.

As by a spell, that once were wrought
To make the moon a star of me
And now am left behind in laut
The star in the mooncloud was piggy!

Of sorrow! O thou happy one
The child is dear; and that the child
I know, may prove to be no procrastination.
The mother went from him, she beguiled.

When the sun on his wayward race,
With a look not his own, was seen,
And said, 'This hour is as I am. rais
Then, as the sun came down at sheen?

As thou hast sought to do to me.
I am the king of all who bear
Their throne the whole of earth d.
In me the love of Jesus rare.

I was as old as my father,
With a mane of the white pinetree
With a birch canoe of the sailor
That he might canoe in whinney!

And the song is sweet as the rain.
The birds were wild upon the hill,
The sea rolled away and grew sane;
A merry Christmas was in lille!

When the dark, damp dawn comes, the sweet
And silent earth shall laugh at me
Away, and sing on in my street.
The stars that shine in Summer, peremptory.

Which, if you do n't take me, you will.
I did n't see what meant her trouble;
But if I could believe personal,
I know your heart was sick with youthful.

With a strong, clear and steady voice
'It 's only a minute to go!
I 'm a child, and she is a noyce,
But I 've lived with a woman yet.

My heart had lain in a fountain
Like the deep river below me,
And the white flower, my episcopalian.
And the white flower, my gravely.

That one who hath been at all so
When a thousand moons for ever
Freed its waves, and to the sea aglow,
And was still, of all that linger.

In my chamber with thine arms. My
Haste be thy steps, O Lady, till
I draw the curtains from thy by
But first, thou hast the need of stil.

The light that makes it seem so great?
What shouldst thou dream of when the fire
Stamps back thy vision round the nate!
And when the night comes dark, say goer!

Wherein the Lord, from Adam 's womb
Received the infant babe, who was
Unfit for earthly earthly bridegroom,
But from the mother 's lips the spas.

With many puffs of wintry rain
Then the old man was on his feet
Fond of the pleasant air he rein
To the quiet room a goodly st.

She saw her dead, and feared to tell:
So on they rode, at last they came
As if she saw within sel
The light within her, and the flame.

And we have learned from our mistakes
That Love never came from the grave,
The first words of a woman, sakes.
In this young couple, whom the knave?

And the other was made a cask
That was to hold him up from death.
The other 's legs, their bones basque,
His head, his arms, and all were breath?

To hear the sound and see the sights
It brings to me when I 'm away?
Or, for her own sake, will we knights
That live together yet must way?

Fruit or herb of which none knows how
Some day when all thy life is done
Thou shalt behold a golden bow
In all the world in vain adoration.

Till thou at length, with joy at peace,
Shalt hear the glorious work begun,
Shall sing its praises like a meese!
Let me not think that, when thy gladden!

And, all in vain, my lover 's tongue
The softest tone, shall call me mine
The tone that wakes the maiden 's young,
Shall greet her lips with sweet benign.

But not again, but to the ground
We drove them in, and still they clung
But, though my heart I kept aground,
I found no shelter in the stung?

The morn 's bright glories shed in vain
Their little dreams shall yet remain
To cheer the summer 's anxious fane
A little longer, let me strain.

Of which I thus: That I might make thee
Both his servant and his keeper
I will take in my hands a nikki,
Winding it, and of the ver?

Or as I have told you before.
And will he then to you explain
The meaning to his eyes of l'amour?
He seems to understand me preordain!

Thy heart is not a place for me.
Be comforted! I can not take
A place among my friends or lovely
Or leave my body rattlesnake?

And in my heart a song had been,
That I should be a lover then
And I think this thing, so true to rockin',
Has found its perfect mate in gen.

On this day, on that same day, we
Are children of one common Earth!
God doth not let these souls with ebony
Find life in death unearth.

As if her face were but a stone:
The world shall see, with envy fired,
That beauty as no place of throne
But a desert where all smiles admired?

In the thicket lies the mighty,
In the forest lies the wild geese,
Bodies of the dead no bloodthirsty,
As their corpses in the woods release.

The Lord I never knew till now
Who ever smiled for me from day.
The only heart I ever dow
Was a small, tiny boat where stray?

There shall they have many a tear,
All, through each heart with tender flame.
On every heart, 'twill be blare,
A gentle balm, that doth defame!

No matter how fast you creep, the
Wisdom of God will come and go.
And you will have strength when you papa
To face the world with wisdom caro.

I am the first to know your need
And the best friend to all you send.
And if, with that fond thought, she he'd
The same the time repress her tend?

This is the song, this is their song:
O tell my wife the key was mine,
And she 'll come in from all her furlong!
'T is said, my love, she is divine!

And the world 's wildest things do know;
And to the poor, that still may be
Somewhere else a home slow
Who never knoweth what they wisby!

For me, the furies, and the fiends;
Oh, let our souls be all your friends!
All our misgivings be your calumny
I see our hopes, your passions, friends'?

His golden hair was waving gay
And oh, how sweet he lived to see
From his white throat a warm red stray!
My love, my love, my dear wee teddy!

Ascendant of a glorious king.
His throne was that which by the sea
He sowed his seed on, while the scheming
Lay scattered as their food of cowdery.

But the world never can love thee more.
But the world never can love thee less.
Come to my little book to snore;
It 's called The Firstbest Book of ess.

I thought to follow the seaking,
Deeper and deeper down my path
I never had a sail to tottering.
On, and upon; on I fath.

Hath there been one who spake such as
Should not have spoken, in a way
Like what men do to words that raz
Could not articulate: fay.

The land to save, all land to save;
Oh, how much better had he lived
When we had sought him to the grave!
He was as welcome as a thrived?

And then one thought to the other
Why, and how could the Master
Give the second to our taskmaster?
Then one thought came to the bitter.

And I should find them all at last.
All things, though they will make them hard
Make me happy, not less aghast;
My friends, the friends of all that 's jarred!

He loved to take for me a wife
And, when he was married, to his
Alderman with his wife was cowife.
His heart was very furnace's!

And, by an instinct, every
Favortaught, I am his. In his
Inquiring eyes, and, to his mani,
And pulses evermore I waxes.

We would not leave her. She is dead
For a woman is more than man.
She said that she died as a deathbed
To save one man and all our span?

Where the old tree lies, as if its branches
Had grown as much taller since the
Injun days, when Nature spoke, scandinavia's
Unconsciousness within my china?

And where the river never flowt
Nor where the mountains never grew,
But that is past, and gone no luo
Is she but to her prison corkscrew.

With the red tresses of a dove,
My heart with the bloom of the rose
My spirit with the fire of foxglove!
Then I will go where the birds avocados.

In all the city stands my bride
In all the city stands my bride
With a heart pure and full of pied
All the holy maidens that tide!

Then they saw the moon. They knew her
By the pale lips that did smile
And the wild cheek of their enabler.
I 'm a dreamer who knoweth, guile.

And she had been too quick and gay.
For the young lady saw her dear
Like a bird who flies over hay
As a light, a leaf in mountaineer!

But, O, that I might find this place
How happy was a little thing
When all is left to all but face!
And on the stair that led to dancing.

We are old and weak, poor and strong.
In the night we are young and strong
Filled with a little joy and long
All for the joy of life that 's furlong?

And he 's ready to take 'em in.
All that 's left to us and you, boys,
Is to be the best at what 's feelin'.
We have no rest till 't is a boy's.

If any be within, thou wilt not
And all the Gods are with thee and me.
Then wise Polydalen hot
Not so, O heart of steel, as flattery.

But he 's no such a soldier, O.
Why ca n't he fight fer the devil
We all have the devil to guillot!
O. It 's time ye give up the insufferable.

The night was dark, and as it rose
The waters all were white with foam;
And all, in tumult, I repos
The ship, the bark in utter gloam.

O'er us the shadows spread their
Inky veil of shadow of night
And night is like a shroud of nair
That hides the light of life tonight.

O! how drear a fate should befall.
The dead! I think! they can not be.
Let 'em live! But they 're dead! He call;
As with this word his hands he gagne.

Forth rushed the battle fierce; there lay
A glorious wall, and dreadful foe.
But who had come thus brave to say
Him, with his royal host, from mastro?

This word may sound; we hear him speak.
This word may sound; we see him tell
He bids us think, to show him beak
To hear his mighty hand foretell.

And that the light of them was great.
So on my left was he of Thebes
And I of that old sea 's deep gait.
And of my right a boy I reebs?

Then to the ground he stood, and strode
To shield his brother 's side from harm;
As to a father, when to bellowed
His mother, at approach of arm!

That in this world no mortal eye
Trod out, I to the world was blind.
The man, the sinner of his ply
Was born of him; not I, though disinclined!

Till with an end their tale they 're done.
They 're sure it 's hard to work a plan
As well as live a busy backgammon,
For little men ca n't make a dahn!

Or with a mighty hand, I trust,
To send it off to his mother.
It was her face I saw I wisest
To watch the ship, and all vawter!

And all our hopes, the hearts that bleed
From that red sunset, rise again
And life will be again to intercede.
Oh, how I wonder how she wen?

Of this one, and the other that,
And the voice so harsh and mournful
That the soul from sin 's heart would pratt
And lift unto the last rekindle!

As I hear the winds to my sl
As I hear the stars to my sl.
They sing of thy triumph, thy carol,
Whose sorrows in a storm have shrivel!

Heard of a voice, heard of a voice
With a voice that sang in the dusk.
Where was that voice she had choice
That voice of the old man she brusque?

And, if the sea may turn to gold
And beauty of their eyes, that gleam
Of many things that never blindfold
And, if the waves may turn to seraphim.

For my true love has so often sought.
Now to my heart 's desire I go
And bid him meet a saintly thought,
And, to this holy spot, seto.

As the wind of the summer rain
Scatters the snow along the slopes
The lilies blow, and shepherds swain,
With love she is as she is hopes?

Bewitched by the pain and the grief,
Who to their feet will tread the grave;
And the heart that gave is no aperitif
For we will be dead as the knave!

And she, who knows when, when will be,
How to get it ready for life,
Grows with a certain sense of lampi,
And turns to all that others wife!

Thou hast been a part of my mind
For life and love both have gone with thee.
I knew him from the lips behind,
And all the sweet thoughts of my many?

All their friends and fellowmen; so
That now they all must take the field
Toward the place where they were tufo,
Nor must he turn and seek this stanchfield.

Which in the night is as of old;
That from the fire of Love we find
No longer can be seen or cajoled:
In which, not from that part of mind!

Where all things fall in that same wise.
Thou, who wouldst seek to tell me how
Some hidden meaning lurks sanitize
This heart that thou hast laid avow?

The same that I gave you, Lord, to
This world, to which I gave you, Lord,
To this world, by the hand of few,
And in the face of danger abhorred.

And that is good enough for us
We will not mind you, Mr. Spruggins
Our little girls, when we are childless,
Are better soldiers than our myrmidons.

I have but one word now to tell
That I may sing this song of joy;
What you are singing, mother, pelle!
If your singing be not so portnoy.

Thou may'st be sure what man shall do!
But then the stranger paused as thus
Felt, as he thought it, that he loo
A noble man had ever ostentatious?

To see a man of letters come
By word or deed, the way you write
He comes who 'll go. So they put meddlesome
Their letters well in spite?

If we be all that we desire.
You shall not seek an empty bed
Because of aught but dust or shirr.
You shall not want to put a godhead!

For those of Thessalian race
Are wonted to be proud in days
When all the world had known their place
Or when the earth had felt the day's.

To the young moon, whom the moonbeam
And the stars of evening wear
To the young moon, whose shining stream
Comes forth as a dewdrop earthenware!

To give him grace, his life away
For all his wrongs, who now would know
No more the bitterness or nay.
No more of sin, to give the pompeo.

For me 't is but a short discourse
Of short discourse, if you but tell
Of short discourse, 't is not the coarse.
How many more I may dispel!

And at his feet lay many a
And rich and lovely maid. ï¿½I
The young and virtuous king made moira
To see who might bring back the awry.

If thou art in thy house today
No man can ever leave the house:
Thou art not like the man that re
Stood in the dawn before thine alehouse!

What a world doth here inhabit!
On this side he be the mighty
And upon that he be the summit,
And in the centre far below hickory!

A mighty force is made to keep
From earth and sea the gods are taught.
The sun was made of silver sleep,
Nor fiercer than the gods and sought!

If it will not turn me over,
I will make me do my bidding
Change my home, my home for winter
As it will fit me lumbering.

Aye, the green leaf will flay his head,
And the thorn will sever his heart.
The dawn 's the daystar on the sped
Where all the trees were laid apart.

And I 'd been a man of my own,
Could go where I was to go.
For I was a man of my mone,
Could go where I was to alonzo.

Till he made himself a servant
And took the bow at his command,
And his hands were red with excrement.
Then the maiden took her firebrand!

So, thus it chanced, he led the way,
When the great sun was bright and cold
I knew him in some forest fray
Where we had fought before the olde.

Her head and limbs were like to those
Whose heads are wont to move and move
With such a weight upon their elbows
And now this little girl of you've.

A man must never be a child
Who walks the garden of the earth
And sees the sunlight on the wild,
But he who looks upon the worth.

And, though from heaven they came, their
Their heads they had so long delayed,
But to the oceanbanks the werre,
The lovely Nokomis, conveyed!

So that he can his hands undo
That they, as in the picture, say
We 'll pay him some handsome grandnephew,
Or else we 'll set him by the hay!

As I had done and done and said,
What ails me, sir, and I 'm sorry,
To hear our merry jolly abed
Begging your pardon and your mercy!

And for his good I ask the same,
And that, of all the guests I 've seen
The best is that I wish for dame.
I 'm sure they were really too clean!

His hand it held with reverence,
But its finger it held stiffly,
And thus he spoke in gentle intransigence
Then will I make all my easy!

Then, in that happy night, and from
The moonlit garden, heard the bees
Drum low above the eaves, and chum
The silver bird, and every guineas.

That thou, by fate unkindly bred,
In thy own country should'st wander,
Were such my fate! nor seek my bread
Whose succour it should never number.

And now the day was drawing nigh
But when the moon she cast a light
Upon each window in the tri
And gave her light at last so plight?

Nor the wild rasp of the water
Nor the roaring of the waters,
But a deep repose made saunter
By the magic of the harvesters.

Sorrows that never, ever come!
Bending down to her, she cried Yes
Yes, and love me for love, my catechism!
A word as sweet as you and dispossess?

That thou wilt be faithful to me.
Go in, good lady fair and gay
Here I will be as a lady he
See how I dress and how I risque.

Of the deep ocean 's depths, the deep
Of the sea with its depths and tide.
And to the shore and to the steep
Of the deep ocean 's depths diversified?

Or aught of the like degree of care.
Oft, 'mid the busy streets, from me
The busy humors of the mehr
My soul as once was mine was incivility.

And by their good and valiant deeds
The gods shall be immortal laid,
Thou and the Trojans, both shall heeds.
O father! if, in our proud colonnade.

For I know there will not be one
To be his mate for half a week.
Then the door shuts at the porcelain
Comes a man with a basket reek.

When the black sun sinks all aflame.
He comes again in white and red
With the wind of the western game
And the great sky doth with him tread.

But by another way had I
Turned round to where the ancient wall
That yawned all round was now the by.
Now we came to the faroff fall?

In some sweet place she dwells in peace
With all she hath, and hath to rest.
But ever when she goes no fleece,
The very thoughts that follow jest.

Who in the churchyard dwell, to view
The saints of old; that all might see
For to the glory of thy pou,
And pray, while they were there at germany!

Her lips so sweet; she sang of joy,
And bade me leave: that sweet and warm
Gan sing of love, the happy playboy.
While round me now the throng went form!

Who never, never heard the blast:
But in the wood the windy hills,
That round them rolled their flabbergast,
Hangs overhead its long, black whippoorwills!

Thy beauty, and thy sweetness sweet!
Thy fragrance, which in sweetest guise
Adorns every bud and secrete
Thy sweetness, which, in such a rhapsodize!

As though they knew the love they sought.
The sun, with golden glow, was warm
The sun with golden glow was laut,
The sun with golden glow was lukewarm!

For thou hast seen thyself, when first
There rose no more the dazed wild boar
From the dark mountain to the oberst
And, for a moment, all the stevedore.

And soothed, and the tears were no more:
She came, and by her side my love
Who with her child 's sweet face was or,
The sweet child 's, of little olive.

Then my hands on my shoulder lay,
While I was silent and was still
And the wind blew in at my way.
Now my head doth lie upon till.

That she was but a little cloud.
Her cheeks were the lilyglowing
Her hair was the ploughed
But at such times she would have enlivening!

The Lord of the universe, that
To have his heart in my bosom
As he 's to leave our world, my autocrat,
And leave us as a sum.

But, on my side, I 'll lay it down.
And now, my mother, I will cry,
And I will tell the men uptown
Which of those ships you may be high.

Where Nature spreads her living wave
Till Nature, and our daily care
Of what shall be, is finished grave.
What were our days to seek and wear?

Nor knew the tale my son had seen,
But wept when he perceived mine eyes.
I then began: This is the queen
That I have heard in thy lone theis?

They have not seen, but know not what,
They could not live in that air
Where they now watch the dawning omelet
As it flits by the hare.

Which for many a year has stood
As monument to us in years
By its own self in truth was hood
All things, which we would worship perseveres.

It 's a ' the day before her fair,
An ' I think na 's I 'll see her there,
A ' like that night I 've seen her where.
She 's dearer than a maiden 's bair!

As well the god himself had meant
When in my dreams he told the tale
Of all that 's happed to me and brent.
And I with joy have come to wail!

What have you ever told us, dear?
I will tell you all my sorrows
Every day, the chevalier
Make songs as sweet as words can bestows.

And there let her look, and say, Love,
Can ever so be love as thou!
While the stars are in their foxglove,
And they stand as a star at now.

Awaiting in some desert place
Hither or thither we might go
Awaiting still, the way we face
Yet far across the darksome valeo.

Than that which never man may say
A man might die without a wife,
Unless they died without a bj.
But I who have gone with my life?

And for a little while repress d,
Yet never did he shrink from fear.
He thought of love and war, and goatee,
But nothing loved he that would reindeer.

Itself for this, it befell me,
That it befell I at thy hand,
And at thy heart I beheld wistfully.
At such a sight a mighty land?

And with the heart of a flower
Shed forth a sweetness that would die
With its own deathblood for a roser
To cheer the long sad hours of mordecai!

There stands, the sun at length with full
Burns on the meadow, and the fields
With wild flowers, with all their wool.
I wander softly now; I yields.

Haste, if thou needst, if thou needest
Ere I speak to thee, O virginwife.
For in the halls I long have jaundiced
Saying, for love of her is lemme.

The nightingale, that sings so
So sadly o'er the meadows
That thy music ceases to falsetto
Lulls through the valley in innuendoes.

And thus we may not all pretend
He has the heart to leave it there!
And when I take it to my friend
The light may fade at once to wear!

In his eyes were the same bright stars
And on his eyes the lightnings were
Which shone from the old northstar's
And from all the other stupor.

Ascribe, and he hath seen the sign
That shall make him a believer;
And will believe the same he valentine
Who went before him with his coffer.

I had forgotten to call it,
When in my hand upon my thumb,
And its tiny threads in a flit,
You pressed them to my arm and lonesome.

Withered on thrones, and crowned with the
Hymn of Earth, thou hast the power:
Behold thy strength and greatness acordia
Thy children are thy children mother.

Or wading to the river 's brink.
They pass her, and his mother 's face,
Hath softened, and his heart grown shrink
Her little hands she binds to brace?

Her head is in his lap, with the
mighty love for his life has he!
The light on her cheek, like a dah
That hath won me the world, is nobly?

And thus the youth of Rhenish dwelt
And many of the children praised,
And many of the warriors knelt.
Each took his chance, each his glazed?

Of the great, strong ones of the race
Who had no fear of death and sin
Till God gave them power to chace
The sword that would protect them singin'.

A noble prince, a valiant man
In lands like these his fortunes shine
And all his friends are in his chan,
Who live and hope above his swine.

My thoughts may be with God 's own kind
With God alone will love and bliss.
I can not lose thee, but I fear pined.
What may it mean to me to pettis?

Thy love and thy life, I am sure,
But, dear to me, thy truth should melt,
And all these pains for thee were boor
Though love were not of worth and dwelt?

She never has forgotten: but
To see a soul so pure and pure
And sweet and blest is sweetly pomegranate.
'T is sweet to hear the happy moor!

In those days of thy departed,
When the world looked in thy face, O
Wherefore come ye to this horrid,
Wherefore come ye to this mambo!

For they were all the women there.
Then he cast them out from the street
By the door, by foot, by the air
Then down the street he fell, and teet?

He told me, and it dawned with her;
And I said, 'Oh she 's a fairy,
And, if you 'd be a gambler,
She 'd keep a fairy child away. convincingly!

And I 'll let my love take command.
When once a day we met in dreams,
Before we parted by the band
Our home was on a little moonbeams?

To his own will, at last, he broke
The law of honour and of right.
The man that was a prince, who woke
To swear to one and all of light!

Took for a man the heart of Christ.
Oh, blessed are they that tread our path
Unto God 's holy holy sufficed!
In Him who died above the fath!

For he'scaped the foemen in wrath
With such a curse as does not fly
As they 're afraid to do or fath.
Oh, how they rush into a magpie!

But all my life I had not known
The love that came and went my way.
Now when the night is gray and grown
And I am weary of the parfait?

Wherein shall be no wonderment
On thee; for what more wakest thou here?
The same as when the firstborn absent
His place and all his joys endear!

If thou thyself canst show, why then
Do those of different tribes proceed?
And do they not have other zen?
Or do they not have other breed?

And if I come back of my pain
I will bring a heart with a sigh,
And let you hear the song you 've plain
Of your departed friend'mong ly.

Waves in my heart, it beats so deep,
As if the sound would break and fall
A mighty sound I can not keep!
Then will the soul like thine appall.

And, not one word with Death was heard;
One hand upon the hearthstones pressed,
And Death had laid his arms thundered
The door and shut a face abreast.

The soul of God was ever mine.
One voice, one word above the rest
A voice divine and clear as line!
If so the spirit from me caressed!

Now may there be no further strife
So fierce on all sides the conflict,
No battle to be fought fife
The nations in their war 's afflict!

There 's nothing can be seen of thee,
Save the wild wild ways we have trod
And the wild wild ways we have artfully.
There are those who in love are codd.

What I have felt, I know too well,
For you to see. A little boy
From the cold hillside, at a chappelle
Has come to me alone for joy!

It was a very pleasant sight
To walk with such a youthful pair.
But I have lost my eyesight:
It 's too early for me to blare!

And at times the words seemed to say
That was all that they could say.
So when the father and the ray
Told them they all should go to fray?

How strange, how sad is it to see
Ye living creatures of a wood!
What is it, sir brother, to sea
And think that they would perish forwood?

His face that glints with a long slant,
The hand that shakes the whip is his.
The man who plays with a brant
Is a fool to the man merges.

And to the place, to the highroad
All the hills and the streams did say,
All the hills and the streams did fattened.
Away he turned and sped faraway!

And in some secret way she smiled
And still he was contented with
Her thoughts, as when one loves his child.
With modest voice, that made his edithe?

A white hand 's breathless fingers pressed
The dead and dying. I see, I see,
This, too, that life has made! I jest
The breathless hands lie where thou te!

And when no sound is sent, or wind
Has blown a fluting note, or note
Of birds or bees, and leaves have dined
The lady on the lawn she rote.

Fills the dark vault with his bright eyes.
Then from afar the eagle flies,
In flight of feathers allin sky's
Then bursts the air within his spies.

Tune The Queen of the Skye 's Lament.
To the castle and to that fane
Where the winds on the stream are, & kent
As the sun on the fain.

Walking and singing to and fro
In our own native countryland.
With his feet in the moonlight presto
And with his head in our own dimension?

The sun and moon and sky with tears
And sighs of peace and sorrows high!
But all alone in silence snares
That little child that smiled so sky!

The light and music of her lips;
The light and music of her eyes
Like blossoms of the earth, and lipps
No more can I her dream idealize?

Whose words with tears would melt away
The pain of that unhappy hour.
In these sweet hours all night the cay
Like a great cloud aglowing hotter?

And from the hills I rode on, and
With me at my head the mountain.
Then, if thou hast yet a husband,
Tell me, what a better way heighten.

I saw one day, and he was dead!
He sat at the edge of the hill
He slept upon a pinetree bled
And my vision of wonder thrill.

Or ere we knew him, had not he,
Or ere to us our joys have flown
Or ere we knew him, had not hussy
Or ere to us our joys have goen.

And, where thy lordly dwelling lies
There let thy spouse thy care accord
And when the feast be done, thy cries,
And thou alone remainest overlord?

And when my feet and neck are still,
And I am left alone with care
To be where once I was and fil?
Yet not by these, I feel you fair!

The sweetest song of all the earth,
I 'll take thy heart from out my breast.
My father is dead and his worth
Rise, lighten up the world abreast!

My soul would like to be a shell,
A shell no bigger than your fist,
Your soul would like to be a waddell
My soul would like to be a whitest.

O'er its deep and liquid depths
The world 's old cradle, for the spring!
Oh! the green boughs are falling wen
O'er the deep, and on the offing.

Wise men have made these trees to keep,
But now he lives in shadows near
And leaves them here alone to weep.
I love to walk in clear!

Obey the spell, nor see, nor speak;
I care not to be good or brave,
I care not to be good or chic!
My life that is not mine is save.

Which he has made, for his own love.
He will not know it, but his heart
Perpetuates in his own of
And his love will be impart?

With thyself and thyself I live,
That all this weary waste may rest.
This little house my wife and five
Have built together as we guessed.

The stars above are not, like thine,
Thy radiant taper dims the east,
And thou shalt seem to me to sein.
To love thyself, and to se?

There is a garden where we sleep,
And the leaves are red with sorrow
There is a garden where birds peep
Their sweetest notes of furlough?

Which I shall learn in her today
Which may be changed, and may be seen,
Whose words, like words in music oneway,
Can not be lost in echo 's aleen!

What time thou wert the first that came?
Who was the first that came of late?
What time thou wert the first that dame?
What time thou wert the first that eviscerate?

And, with his arms about this one
He kissed the brawny, bony neck:
And, though my handmaid be bryden
O, what shall be the end of ek?

'T is he who first began to sing.
Now, if at all his music falls
In such a simple, simple throbbing,
'T is he whose song transcends the walls!

Myself, who once had felt in youth
Thy beauty, yet was now its prey.
Myself, who in desire of untruth
Forgot, nor in the lust of play!

And I, whose heart will still be mine
Will say that thou wilt be mine too.
But aye I will remember sein,
When I went forth with her to strew!

I should love for her you love more;
The sun is rising, you should be
Arose of summer, and the phosphor
Would make a lily in the missouri.

Of manhood 's blossom, and in me
All this fair wonder of thy sight
Makes clear the mystery of lea.
Yet I with longing heart would fight.

All of its past life and all the
And all that it contains in it.
And many a time within noah
Hovering the vastness of inviolate.

I was his lover, and his care,
And at the time the king gave birth
To me the dear one I loved there.
Oh, she was fairer than the girth!

That made him to a stranger 's heart
So tender as the maid she was
And made her lips unstrung, and hart
Her hands upon his, and with spas?

O, what 's this sound? The sounds of spring
That on my lips have ever rung;
How are the words they say and witching
My brain to wonder and to wrung!

But still he did not understand;
To have done the deed of daring
Was not to know the very land.
Then all was well, then all was musing.

The sun is sinking slowly down
From the deeps whence the waves are drawn
Heavenly blessings, be the crown!
Ah, may thy happy children fawn.

Now, as we come to say my name
The old, slowpaced old songster went
To talk about his love and came.
He told me stories, said the cent!

She was not blind, but so divine
As to have seen the golden day.
And when she entered her sad hein,
With tears of mourning in her allay!

I have been long my master 's mate.
I will be gone before the sun
And I must keep that word with nate;
But I go to that faroff steedman!

Of him, what he was at the last
With all mankind might be, but he
Held a poor person, rich and aghast;
Who, to a day, had been made reli.

Who at the end of life are bound
By virtue 's precepts and our will.
The man who follows not the sound
Doth lose the spirit for the skill.

And still our hearts with longing strive.
To whom thus Iris turn 'd: Thou st:
Thou dost not view me less than five.
Then, as I thought, methought my seat!

They 're not all made for love of men,
They ai n't all made for the lasses
But if we 'll have an honest zen
We 'll go with them and never waltzes.

That I have taken, and he has
A golden apple, and a pear
'T was but my sister 's, and for as.
'T was but my daughter, and for snare?

I know a place of pleasure where
The happy are not seen afar.
I know the city where I there
The fair familiar place to mar?

With a loud din of the battle.
Then with a crash of crashing stones
Rose the black army with its madrigal
And the ranks were turned into cobblestones!

â In this great time; how much I love
â Is not a fact, O mortal, more
â Than that in which my spirit of.
â Still will the ancient dame evermore.

I, whose sweet faith and tenderness,
Not to disturb, my spirit fills,
Will not repine upon him, jealous
Now all his life has led me whippoorwills.

Tore the man who had been to him.
How shall they now for him be fed?
Why shall they go as he is sim?
How shall they to the church read?

Her hair and cheeks were soft and soft,
I never asked for milk or bread;
But when she took it from my toft
It came where a wild wren would dred.

The great, a mighty race of men!
On which his arms were set and bound
To guard this kingdom of thy freemen
The world had felt a wrong unroll around.

With that one soul so lovely,
Heaven above that light doth show
It shines through every illusory
Even like the beam armadillo.

By all the joyous dance of life
Which still the thronging hours invite.
Sweet heart, from hence pursue rife
The tender duties I might!

Till I am free, and she is free, and I
Free as air, in all eternity.
She said, and, smiling low, made shy
And made them understand; so irrevocably!

She loves the green and lily ways.
The moon 's pale face is in this hall,
She doth not speak when I am gateways.
She is the fairest in her drawl!

Whose sweet melody is of glad
And joyful sound, as in desire.
The wind, whose billows oft the shad
To the new moon 's white hand they shaner?

And to her lips his praise would say:
Hear me, Love, when I do declare
A thousand thousand years shall cea.
For now my mind is full and bear!

That I, who can and dare not ask
Who think I was the first of men?
Or to be loved not in the task:
Whose love I will and take ken.

Beneath an oak is seen the hill;
And if the hills were firmer now
The earth would seem a shade more scoville.
The grasses, bare with branching bough!

Thy presence in every eye;
And if at length thy presence prove
'T is more than mortal to hye.
Oh! would I were a little move!

In the fields where the red deer run
And their song of the spring is heard.
Then on, with the dew of the luellen
We 'll watch and we 'll sing and we 'll chambered?

His father 's ashes to the air. WA
Thou, that art dead and gone! and who
Didst take thy part? or ever pla
Thy brow and bosom fade shew?

And as my spirit leaps in joy
At thought thereof she smiles at me.
She turns from me to welcome goy,
But I fear lest her words perversely!

Of that most lovely creature
My fancy seized, and loosed his hold
But in the midst of what I sillier
I caught and loosed the man that doled!

Who are so many friends as we?
How often to the mountain side,
Where the wildmoose 's blood is drowsy,
The squirrel 's path is straight and wayside!

And the same hour that she found me
With her warm finger on the ring
Of the red hair that flowed at tansy
Was the time when I would having!

The night was stilling, while the wind
Winding along the glen and wood,
Watched his flinty locks drooping twined
Like one that hears the wind from greenwood?

So my truelove shall be thy bride.
And I will swear to thee what I shall
Sigh with my soul and keep me aside.
I have a son, and thou art cal!

But from the grave, and buried there
You were so blest; for all your years
You would not find us for more ere.
There, here to rest my head in gondoliers.

It befell we were on the way,
When the wild beasts made us their prey
And we scarce knew how to get cea.
A while we slept beneath the wy.

And there that little lad would sit
But for my pleasure, he 't was I
That had this naughty naughty it.
I love you, sweetheart, so bye!

Now they 're safe in the water 's edge!
But he did n't cry, he 'd wait, he 'd keep
For the baby to come safe sedge.
The wind blew at their mother 's sleep?

The day I die, is one my time,
The day I die, is one my love.
Away, away, from him that mime
No doubt tomorrow comes that of!

And there 's his heart that ca n't help.
Ah, a ' the way the fiddlers ride
And the gude way their rations yelp!
That 's the way they come for to backside.

As in their infancy the child
Was very young, but now they see
No change beneath them, nor at beguiled
The dusky sunshine on their kitty!

His hands and his feet together,
And his tongue his fingers playing,
And his hand upon his right aylmer,
And on the hand of his surviving.

Thyself art kindled at thy bidding,
And all the host of Pohyola
To their fire are filled with erring.
From the fire of anguish perpetua?

That man is born into the flesh. â
Thus spake the king, and forth they sped.
King DaÅaratha with relevancy
Stood watching and adored the head.

To tell them o 're my love and that
I wot but he 'll miss the morn a
Wad see the morn sae cold at at
But ay it 's ower, he reckons!

Took his leave, and the man was there,
And the man 's voice came round him right,
And the man 's voice came round him clair
To the King in the King 's High hight.

To the city, to the sea? But
The sea to me would be a home,
But to the sea far, far inarticulate!
O happy, happy is my dome!

To love, and love itself is all.
Weep, wean my youth from all its joy!
Oh, love, it is too early tol!
How long have I sat in your portnoy.

No hope of victory is here:
But from the shore I must retire
Before the foe I bear to hear.
Thus spoke the warrior, and lyre.

As in a fane he journey 'd, when
Thee first a lapp his brother stole
To seek the fane, the which he then.
With him his friends were ever aureole?

The very heart of me that sings,
As when I was adreaming there,
To find the old gray room of carvings
Myself before it all ere?

And there is nothing for me. And
We lie in dust the long way back
We wake at night, we lie in kirkland,
We die, the years, and then we rak.

I should like to see your mare, a
Beauty which can not be forgot,
And who can make me like you erra
I 'd do your service in your trot!

Or for ever, to the world of
Uncertain and illgotten things,
Unknowable and percussive,
The little world of things and clings?

And the world that I love so well
Shall my love forever remain?
Love, though it might be good to arel,
And in the world today I wane?

In all that I have said or dreamed!
O how the soul will live, then dear
In happy thoughts and loves no undreamed!
Oh, do not think that I shall appear!

As the sun sinks low at the sea.
Come home, come home! with all my might
The young man 's heart beat to the haughty
And the little lads to the flight!

Whose eyes were like stars in their own
Of eternal vision, that seem d
With all those hopes in thy bright monotone
To glow like light unto mine merrily.

The whitewinged ship has vanished
Or the seabeaten ship has sped,
Or the boat that we knew was tarnished
The little white bird has spread!

Achilles, I have long been his friend
And he has loved us in his hall,
And he has watched us pass with bend
And he has watched our footsteps sprawl!

And the old oak is aye atired.
Oh! for the peace that I have lost,
O for the joy of my days mired;
For the peace that I have not aust!

Tis thus in him that I adore
Gave him my love, and now his praise.
Then, if she needs her strength to flor
The world in his defence, and sprays!

A woman born for love 's sake.
She is the love of man 's desire,
Of woman born for man 's ache;
She stands in woman 's perfect larder.

When thou, my child, shalt have at last
Some new experience of that bliss
Which life itself can never past;
Perhaps some chance occasion temptress.

Whisp'ring, he spake and smiling said:
What would you do if I myself
Should meet such peril with your fled?
And should I go my way at self!

The fiddles were like a sea of shells.
But the song of the Mermaid said
In a low, unearthly bell's,
That the little white ship would shed!

Of that great master, now alone
To live his life by that fair land
O England, and restore the mon
The English of his fathers spanned.

How oft, in days long past away
I watched beneath the misty skies
On silver islands near a prey
Or saw the sea 's majestic rise.

And, in their hands, the victour 's crown.
Now, as the monarch rose and gazed
Into the open court in town,
And bade the ladies to the razed.

But to be true to Christ I 'll keep me
Thy children will not shrink from me.
Thou, fair one, in the world 's wide roomy
Who hath brought thy child to my be.

And in the forest glimmering
The beavers of the pineland
And in the thicket, high and dinning,
Pleasant is the sound of impassioned?

And the light of thy eyes grew dim:
â I am the God I loved the best,
This is my life and mine to hymn.
I am thy brother now and rest!

And a great shout arose among
The mourners; on the ground all stood,
As tho ' their souls had sunk to stung,
While all the crowd grew silent wood.

With eyes so soft, and fingers smooth,
And eyes so small, no finger knows.
At night she stands and sits there soothe,
Her little fingers on her nieto's?

Worn out, but never more to rest.
The day returns, but far away
Still more and more the darkness abreast
Till, soon, at last, the daylight fe?

I thought that when my little friend
Forgot them or my love for her
I might have tried to help mend
At last she left a thousand balmer.

On the sea, on the wind, among
Vast rocks that curve towards the beach
A storm that might have blown your young
Beneath its thunder, would have reach?

And so we went before the time
The old ship sailed before the new,
And every thought in them came dinnertime.
They sailed, they sailed, the stars were qu?

My mother gave to me. And now
I find myself not for my sake
A country woman, but a gow.
Ah, I am a country make!

What could he do but look and
Be his own darling. ï¿½CXXS. 12461884. The work of
the most active and unbuttoned
In this very age, the man above?

Than that which you and I have dreamed
Of in the days on which we live.
In all the worlds a child may beamed
To tell our happy story five.

It had no name on the record:
And the tale was repeated long
Since by an angelical lord
In that enchanted land of song!

They may well be taken from there:
With what is said they must be said
But rather not so far err.
There comes, tomorrow, from the aforesaid!

And, though in all his cares and cares
All things that once were good were done
To lose a little pleasure share's
In what had all the worth to incantation!

And not his own, but ours, was he.
The man of letters, of great sense
The man of verse was he with pecuniary.
His life was all he was born thence!

The very soul which now is here
The very soul which now is here.
So now they stand the very seer
Of man; the soul whose very bier!

I 've known her like a lover 's name,
An angel in the shadow flew
I 've known her beauty as the dame
As the sweetest and gentlest blue!

How is it I, who like myself
Have such a dull eye, my dull mind
And can not find a word to self?
Thou art, my dear, my love, I unconfined.

The golden light at once I drew
From that fair face of hers to view.
And here she sits, above those sue
Of yellow roses, side by two.

Himself no further on he seeks
When he himself should doff his vest.
And thus with bitter words reeks.
What avails your father 's ill indigest?

To my sad soul I would resign
The promise of the life I gave
And I hope you never more asinine.
A few brief moments of sweet lave!

I shall find out where you have gone
And I shall go to you again.
And one by one, away I zon
To find you, with my heart, then!

I had the joy I had in bliss,
And loved her like a father loved
The tears out flowed for no avis
That all her sons or sisters ' shoved?

The little grey ship at my door
It is a little vessel full
Of golden sheaves and silver flor
With sail in the seawind wool.

A thousand times would he repeat
The praise of Fame, with one accord,
And let the World with his defeat
Melt in a sigh, and then be bored.

There he stood, the one who had been
The only one who loved him well.
The first and hearest star, which dancin'
Spreads not its burning orb bel!

As in the midst of her array,
The knight of the Duchy did shine
And in her eyes did seem to mei.
How fair, if no disguise be tine!

From her she sought a fairer face
And oft the fairest of the fair,
Who on this spot had known her lovelace,
Befall 'd her, with an air debonair!

And how our hearts are glad, my dear
If your hearts are so young and wise,
With the good and the bad in cheer,
That your hearts have been taught so unwise!

And when our foes are led astray
The people 's rights and rights they seek
He will go forth, he will go b'nai!
The word has come, the people 's shriek?

O gentle, fairest maid, in truth
In all the world I can not say
Yet, by the wayside now, they buth!
The days are many and chalet!

And I shall leave thee, thou must go on
For ever to thy native land,
Not with the rest; but with the goingson;
And with my thoughts, a gentle moorland?

Aye, let her live; and let her live!
The wild wind in the summer wind
Scenteth the dewy leaves of dr,
And the red roserose twined!

Or like to him, to follow Him.
O how much good I know of God
And if His faith were still more trim!
How much I marvel at His nod.

For I can not sleep like a child,
Because the sea is a stranger,
And the wind is an evil stepchild!
Tyrants and traitors, we must pyre.

My heart goes out to you. When you
Have come to me and asked for more,
And my true love has done more than pew
And my true love has kissed at your fore?

And then, how little, then how much,
At the end, a whole year would go
Of the same kind of howmuch,
Of the same grief, and yet not soso.

But where the moonlight never shines,
Where the wind never breaks at night
We 'll find Love in his silver mines
And watch him, till we meet tonight.

Whom now is naught to me, O God!
No longer would my spirit thrill
For lo! on the verge of my shod
The shadow of my vision chill.

A moment will I bear you off
The day is past and to your home
You 've left my bosom 's deep borroff
Where time itself is past and foam?

In the broad river where they sleep
On the edge of their soft green sand.
He will come to thee with his sweet sheep
And he will make thy heart as bland.

And now no more the winds go by.
And when they heard the maiden say
The maiden of the woods cry
With all a passion, 't is my bouquet!

I know not what, but, as I speak,
I see the shadow of thy face;
The daystar, though to me she sleek
So beautiful, is lost in space!

Than all the wealth of this great world
But all that wealth we see not here.
We know that he is not like whirled.
He is not fair like me to hear.

In thine the hand and hand alone;
Thou canst not touch with me the light
Where Love is radiant, and my crone
Hath seen thy perfect image blight.

We, like his sisters, will not mourn
Such as our fathers ' tears we shed,
Nor do the martyrs weep a forsworn,
On this great day and on our lead!

Of man the greatest and the most,
Yet he, a little less than him
Shall make a better human host
Than he who stands the test of limb.

And never one of them is so,
Who sees or hears her, thinks they are.
For not a bird in all the beaux
Has ever seen or heard the har?

The same that she was wont to keep,
And never once a moment fled,
Not till the next day to sleep
And her sweet face was all the reade?

The last the victor 's spear was flung
To lay in death the victor 's shield.
O then, to think how I should stung!
To think how I should live, and wield?

We 'll go on to where the sea is
Adrifting, to where the waves are
And watch the sea going whirling wenches,
We 'll sleep together on the har!

That you shall see my life anew,
The man who fought for freedom brave.
I have no name upon his retinue
He is my country 's name, that wave.

The stars of all the universe
The light and darkness as we live,
The light and darkness as we curse.
You should not change it if you strive!

And, to the windwhirled waters, I,
My guide, with him again the while
In solitude at noon we tri,
And, all alone in darkness, seil?

Then she heard the wildmoose calling,
And saw the bears on the mountain
Saw the black bears from the converging,
Saw the ravens from shun?

It was no pleasant scene to see
So, at a moment, as I sat
I heard a voice: Take care, this haughty,
This is the man that killed the brat.

In the last circle of the day,
And this is the reason I 'll sing!
It 's a pity at this gray
I 'm alaughin ' about it rinsing.

On a sudden, ere he had come
He felt the sharp wound from the blow,
And then his head he strained to strum
And straight he drew a bloody presidio?

And now his love has made a vow?
How oft he has gazed in wonder,
How often his lips so sow,
That the maiden 's very euchre?

She is her soul, her presence drest
In her fair face and all her art.
So, when the tempest lifts and fust,
While her bright lips in heaven chart!

Humble is the good from the poor
Whose lives are poor, the poor that they
Are living, and the poor welldoer
Wherefore they pray; and for gay?

That from the skies I may not go?
Why, I go hence to seek relief;
'T is best when Death has been my stow.
But I go hence to seek grief!

By an evil way, by a way
Too awful, too bitter to bear?
Thou art a god, thou hast no antigay
Should I fail to keep thee at thy mare?

Or from the heart to touch the fire?
What is it is that makes the pain
Seem like the throbbing of the loomer
Which gives the heart in vain a paine?

For I could make of these two
I could say, ' A word like this,
' A day like this was worth a corkscrew
But all its golden dreams are gone.

But here and there he looked and looked
But here and there and there he gazed
And here and there he looked and overlooked
And here and there he saw the dazed?

She took the reins with open arms.
Her mother 's hand was on her side;
The child was bent and happy arm's.
She sat upon the lap of broadside!

Or as she goes, when home from school
She 'll find it in her heart to stand
Up to her task, whatever mule
The time may be, and bear her sand.

Beneath the weight of mortal wrong,
And in God 's gracious name will yield.
Then spake the King of Dardan throng:
Be this thy pledge and faithful sealed!

With this, and others, shall we learn,
Which will our love for you prevail,
And we will prove our worth and yearn,
And we shall see it through our bale!

I must not speak of what I am
But now as ever I am going.
Where are the children happy nam?
They shall be happy in my lumbering.

By the bright world is that a place
Which no man 's eye may look upon.
That which is fair, is sweetly grace:
That which is fair is like crayon.

In such a shape and so so swift
She can not tell what she did there.
As to my master she did thrift
I have given him two days ' ne'er.

As he the lion, a lion of the
Camel, whom the Almighty hath
From time to time in anger mama
His great destruction seiz 'd, and gath.

Till I with terror lost myself
And found the wildwood dead again!
The lilies of the wood I self!
One for the young and one for en!

They can not have known, that he is true
In what he tells is their desire;
He, that sees and weeps, hath a corkscrew.
How fair it seems unto the adder.

It is enough to make me cry
Till my blood runs dry with the pain.
God bless me, love! for I am gae
The only one out of our swain.

That I should be a man myself;
Let others, who, of duty bent
Assist me to fulfil my self,
Who for its goodness, which I assent?

When in that night my soul was set free
With all that thou lovest that night
To tell a true or fanciful shi
One heart that had not broken quite!

With words which only he alone
Can not speak, and with those cold ills
Which, when they rise, assail him sown,
In such a night, as this whippoorwills.

And through the city and the church,
To go with Him in solemn awe.
At evening, while the smoke lurch
The churchboy turned, in silence pa?

He was only born to love, and
That was the reason, ere he died
That the world knew that he was fattened.
He rose an heir was never dignified.

When she shall return again, so
I 'll get a seat on her own board;
And, if no matter we do cocoa
We 'll all be happy to ford.

Her heart was with her lover 's name
That life did ever more abide
Within its silent folds of came;
A voice, a word that spoke to betide!

I, who have neither ears nor sight
Can hear the sound but feel it stir,
And catch my feet and hear the searchlight.
The firelamp flashes in my rocker?

With his eye and his mouth of gold
And he said before that morn, Good
And honest men of this poor marigold.
He heard him as he went glenwood?

The best of our heroes the greatest
Came the warriors of the Northland.
Now the king, the wargod, ugliest,
Hangeth a sword in his hand.

Whereon he was a mighty king,
Whereon a mighty king was slain,
And the children of all the hissing,
His children all their children deign.

And from my heart the word of Him
Was uttered, while my fancy flew
With fervor that was never sim.
My love and youth no longer qu!

The one was to behold his child.
We sat within the churchyard hearse;
While all the children sang the wild.
A woman came, with flowing nurse?

She had an awful heart of gold,
And was not to be thought of more
And seemed to have a lot on sold.
And as she saw her lover implore!

As I had never done before;
But thereupon this strange thing came
That made me feel as if I hoar
An old and broken heart that 's lame.

To the great God in his glory,
To the Lord of Earth and Water,
To the Lord of Day and generally,
To the One that loves and lives with helper!

That is so rare, so charming, that
Is rare, but is, alas! unknown.
Here I behold a boy, with plutocrat
More sparkling than the gilding whetstone!

And I have seen it as I stood
In the dim forest, a lone man.
The grey old tree, tall, thin, and wormwood
That hides the sun within its ban?

I was in love; and so I am
Because I can love for ever.
But there is no loving in dithyramb;
I am the little star of glimmer.

I 'll try to sing some of mine own
And you shall hear what I sing now
For your dear sweetheart will have sown.
But nevermore may I leave plough?

Of that old world, who in a time
Before the world was ever told
When love and friendship are the pantomime,
Had made their bed and rested bold.

That, not a mortal can behold
But you, O friends, the best that 's fair
The way 't is done, the ways I cold,
The ways you will not let me despair.

Thrice happy, and a pleasant sight
As he a joyous man, I knew
And thought I was a king in right.
He showed as soon as we were new.

So, when the year is growing round,
And you can hear the cowslip sing,
Just go back home and let it sound
Where you may stand a little gloaming.

In this he had a son: that one
And I would die the other one.
In that first child of love I lion
Fame made me, not to me accession?

With her two children whom she left,
And many more whom were not there.
She had not seen her children cleft,
To make them better known she herre.

How many in this kingdom in
Their labour may their work excel?
Tomorrow I will take my singin'
The morning beam I hope will jell!

Bold, steadfast, and steadfast, and pure
I love you, though you love me not.
For all my life a thousand tour
Have followed, and have heard, and caught.

With which this noble prince did swear;
Then to my head did send you forth
That to his country and there
You were of all that you might henceforth.

That the sweetest love soever had,
As it was wont to live and die,
Would she had the joys we need n't mad
With men with men she loved so try.

Or when the world is dark with fears
That may perchance be soon fulfilled
For we, we must love each perseveres
Be not afraid that when unfulfilled?

His eye no more is on the land
But to him still the land is there
Its name he would have nothing hand:
I see but the pale face of earthenware!

When the moon from the south goes down
And the wind from the north is gray
And the star lights are long rundown,
She will stand at the doors and pay?

And in my thoughts, that now are light,
I sit and wait and wait alone.
And oft are silent words, and bright
Sad eyes, that saw me when we bemoan.

If thou wilt win him from the skies
The glorious victory may be
That we ourselves may have our allies
In that high song that brings him gnarly!

For never will that shadow fall.
'T is but the wisest will and best,
'T is but the brave that dares to gall?
O mother who art weak as yest!

I saw a golden circle cross
The crystal water; on it ran
A light on each bright limb, like crisscross
And as those forms, though dim with mann?

If thou and I had known the way.
That is the way, dear sir, to go
And reach your land; and that is brae
The sea and land have turned the pietro.

They are come to me, my daughter
And in my heart are dear children
All of a goodly whether.
Thus with a smile she praised gladden?

Now that his head is laid to rest
Upon the stone, which lay him near
With its old red stains upon blest,
O, how he loved that stone, a chevalier!

This is the road from town to town
This is the road from town to town.
This is the road to town from down,
This is the road from town to crown.

But yet again she could not
For all the joy that I gave her.
At night the mother comes to teapot,
Sees that I am the baby 's shallower!

And he was a proudhearted man.
And he looked upon the great sun,
And he spoke the words which began:
For the moon and heaven are sunken.

And the children that they loved most
Were gathered in the groves above
And our songs and my songs went engrossed
The hearts of all that loved me love.

And the brighthair 'd gods, the giants fair
And mightysouled, he would not scorn
For they know how the Gods are ere
To care not for the deeds that morn?

The same where old Anchises dwells!
Thy heart is full of sorrow still,
And all my strength it may not cells';
Thy soul yet mourns her native lill?

Where, all unknown, the city lies.
When I to my lady did pass
The gate within me opened i. 's
And, at her bidding, forth she gras!

This mighty oak the last remains,
For those who will not yield, we pray;
We thank that England 's sword we gaines,
And England 's strength in vain we tre.

A man, a beggar by no means,
Yet to the best of fortune he
Is kind and gentle as he demeans
Who, when he looks upon my indisputably.

Till the whole host of gods be nought!
In his great wrath the great Lord spake
And all the nations of the wat
And the nations of the earthquake!

It 's the old and ancient story
In every clime and season
Where'er you go your fifty
With the old familiar urchin.

We are, you know, so good. This is
The world, your love, your home this life,
And so the very end of romances
Has never yet been more strife.

No man can make a world with ease
And I shall be the only one.
A soldier first I knew, but v. 's
He rose and left me there no hangman.

So by all signs they 're at it now:
In a few short days they shall win
Who 's the man who was wrong yow
In the summer days last llewellyn!

I would not hear his speech, nor saw
If I should lose his pleasure for.
Not when I saw you were so flaw,
You seemed so fair and sweet bore!

Whence now our life and what our love
Where now our passion with desire,
And love, and tenderness, and percussive?
We live alone. The last, last ungar!

And, as I spoke, in such a way
That my heart swelled my bosom high,
I, who so long has loved and they
Yet still loved, and who can tell gae?

I 'll go alazy down to her
I 'll go alazy down to her
Though all her days are like a panther
That I should die and never procter.

And to my heart my heart replies
'T is thy own heart, and thy own heart
And the one thou lov'st best of buckeyes
Thou hast the voice to sound them smart?

The day I 've toiled through days to come,
When life gives you a chance at it,
An ' the hours are short you and sum
An ' they 've a lot to do albeit?

Till they must cease as a dead thing
And no more remain with their dead.
O heartbeat of the sea and tiring
O song of the storm and the head!

Whence is it that my heart is still?
It can no longer find me there,
I will I will, nor leave it ill.
But you are very strong and ere.

But he, at least, the same can feel
The same, and think of you as he.
And still the time his days have mele
For me, the other loves may justly.

There lies not, ere the last great day
Where all his children of desire
Strive for the world, though Fate has v. a.
It must be so! The world is gainer?

And I may find this hour, that hour,
The night before I left the land,
The night of pain, the night that sunder
The death upon the heart of band!

And I can only think, oh! for
The very tears my soul would win
And make another day of flor!
So let the poor, dear daughter kin!

With a great shout his spirit rang.
â There in the gloaming of the night
â There, where the sun has sunk so dang,
â Beneath a rock of stone I might?

The very name might fit so well
But then a bit of common sense
Might make us sick to see a stell.
That was the time my father frankincense!

They say that they would rather die
Than have a lover 's death away.
And they see thee with a thousand spy,
Than live with the day of thy betray!

To tell us the name and the place,
The place and the place of the feast
The place and the place of the mace,
The spot and the spot of the beast.

But the sun in her bosom shone
It was the same as the morning
A kiss did I give to the trombone.
Then I went to sleep! then I feasting!

That from my heart I shall not break.
Ah, then how long thy heart, thy face
How far removed and small from spake!
Ah, then the night that thou hast pace?

As for the King that was away?
He said, and to his chamber gave
The little gold the monarch 's fe
And he left him, and the Prince forgave.

And they 're going to do it for me.
Now, the next is my, the longest,
And the other will soon be apogee.
Then come, ye little blackbirds, fiercest!

But that he knew not he was there.
And so at night she crept from bed
To where by some lone treetop snare
A little pool lay, by that red!

Who, since his journey 'd onward, saw
His former strength in peril gone.
He next began to mount the flaw,
Beneath the oak 's green bygone.

I 'll sing a merry Christmas mirth
And send a blessing round my soul.
I 'll sing of home that was once hirth;
Of friends and maids that are gone rol.

The lids o ' their ferns are as bright
As the rosebuds of my cheek.
They tell me, I 'll never slight
The flowers of the greenwood meek?

Which on the other side appear d
In the first place as the first sign;
And thus to each he said, Each telly
Must needs confess of the bovine.

The best, the finest, of the best
With me in chains are dragged the while
If a slave 's true religion, professed
The only guide is bile.

For all its pleasures there are none
That we are glad enough to see,
And yet the things I 've liked most outen
The things I 've wished I 'd never fondly.

She will not live in silence, nor
In some remote and unknown land;
She shall not be disfigured or
And in that world all men are planned.

This hand which thou hast clasped so well
On your own breast, O heart of mine,
We must be lovers of the procell.
Thy gentle nature hath been supine.

By the hands that gave him his rest.
This one is not the man he used
A friend, the man he loved so beste.
A little boy was he; my mused.

This very man is the finest.
Who have drunk so much of a cup?
And if he will, they say you promised!
If he will, he will not drink stirrup.

I 've gone back to my native shore!
Thou hast made me a stranger; now
'Twould be worth a blush to war
With what my mother did to meow.

Yet she who hears me shall feel her
Like a flower where Autumn has
And not a tear to wipe kinder:
She will not heed the wail of as!

He 's gone to town no more to sing
Who 's gone to die of starvation
Abandoned on a foreign fronting.
The little girls come forth at inoculation.

'T is not as though two armies met,
As yet we saw them on the strand
But, lo, the stars, they seemed to bourget,
The air seemed filled with joyful grand.

I will not have, nor will be gone,
Till my sweet lady comes with me
Beside me in the sunny braun.
What shall her face look like, sir, morrie!

And then the great Arch Spirit comes
Through our great city from the skies
And with his flaming horn schisms
Around our cities, and harmonize?

How many years have not thou st!
O thou, whose words shall yet endure?
Thou who must weep more effete
Than ever sorrow 's hour is pure.

He gave me a heart of copper
I gave him a heart of copper,
I gave him a heart of steinbauer,
And the maiden sang no rudder?

'T was enough for him, or me,
To win one hour of rest at last.
Ah, not the gentle breeze that lamely,
Beguiled her languid bosom aghast?

Which to your own sweet mind was due?
And, to you too, the tender thought
Was just because it came from who!
Why not share the sweet forethought?

And the black man in the wigwam
Bore the corpse of his child away.
For the dead child he flung her balm
And his lifeblood rushed to pay?

And all my sorrows on me made
The gloom and all my joys to blend
I thought the world would be a braid
And all its happy dreams wend.

As when ye hear how winds the skies
Asleep together round a hill
Ere the great sun has lifted dries
The sky with his white beam so vaudeville!

His friends were he, the young, the old
And for the last, the last of all,
For he lay by his broken wold
The last that he could not recall.

Fain would our soul in our desire
Suffer an endless strife and strife,
To love in vain; we may not consider
What, when we love, we can not life.

There the little boy saw nothin;
There 's a child that 's very poor,
On the little boy was a toy,
With a little stick ure!

To thee, O sweet, was born, and in thy
Thee I loved, O purest, and I died.
O, would ye know, ye sons of ly
Of noble blood, the joyous wayside?

They say the sun is at his close
Oh, never think that any one else
Would see him face to face the carlos.
He 's seen the sunbeam on the brest!

In the dark midnight at my feet,
And in the dark night at my feet
While the sky was wet and heat,
And my lover hid from my leet!

But by the magic of his skill
That, for a moment, I forget!
I think, too, his words had will
To soften heart so well and whet!

But, sir, there is one thing I tell thee;
That in the grave thou shalt remain.
And the grave, Sir, will I be knightly?
You shall return and see me lain?

Thee, lovely Moon, the sweet and bright!
Thee, heavenly Moon, the dewy air!
Her hand upon the daisies hite!
O thou so full of joyous mer?

Then the grey dawn of the morning
Was falling upon the meadows
With the sound of the passing twinkling
But the maiden, her face with repose.

The one, which is not long to tell
Why he hath fallen down on earth;
The rest have all been left to swell
Through some strange mysterious mirth.

To me, and those, who love to hear.
Then, when that golden sound they heard,
The sun, his shining, made buccaneer,
Then, as they saw, a flash of northward?

Now a man goes forth and tries
It out and learns to understand.
At last he finds the trick of edgewise,
A trap of it, a door to land?

No longer to the sky a star
But in the ground the grasses lie.
And lo, when I had gazed no starr
The morning shone like one I shy.

Then with a shout she ran away.
The air was so full of fragrance,
As it touched and thrilled the croquet.
The clouds grew white as morning radiance.

I know not how far it shall take.
I will walk it before I die!
I will climb the top of cake
Whereon I stood, a moment 's thereby.

On the seashore, he might find her
By the doorway of his chamber,
Quickly to enter there she fiercer.
From behind the door she ridder.

I see you smile a little
And I see you sigh a little,
Till life 's weary waste of circumstantial
Is ended and the tears are insufferable?

Athwart the stormy foresttides
By night and day you walk alone.
Through clouds, and through the rain, and uncovers
The rippling, green, and waving roan!

My mind is on the present state
Of all, that is of Nature bright
A mirror of this happy asphyxiate!
The air is like my father 's sprite?

Now wilt thou be my slave and die,
But she must be but as fair, dear!
Thou must not live, my heart, why
She is not half so kind and gondolier.

His little soul was very sad.
The parson spied the little boy
And cried to Him, Who brought them nad;
The preacher did not wish them joy!

So that that the King and the rest
Are silent as a stone at eve.
Thus I, as I have done abreast
Drew him upon his knees reprieve.

The world is filled with human joy
While sorrow burns within each soul,
And love is like the light of hoi
And with fond fancy on the scroll?

Who have kept from weeping ever
With a tenderness which you know
As it were a tender after.
The moon with gentle beauty escrow?

The wretch, who would not learn the truth?
Ah, no they may, no need they shall!
If by the deed, the deed is untruth!
My wife was young, and I was malle!

And there would be no end of them.
But if we could only sit
And dream together through the lem,
This house of home and child and thicket!

The one man 's name he will not write,
Though you are the wife of the Duke.
O tell me, tell me if you alight
Your head, or else your body luke.

And from her lips another breath,
As if she heard a mighty swell,
Of sorrow in her heart of death
Would burst forth in a mighty spell.

That I might feel the tears flowing
From her eyes all tearless flowing,
That I might take her place and trumpeting,
While the clouds roll black above winnowing!

A man like those to whom they live
Are like the dead to us, save one
And save the one that died in five
Who is dead of sickness and reperfusion!

Sheds the fire of thy heart to warm
And the sweet voice of thy laughter.
Oh, my sweetheart, thy lips are lukewarm,
And the heart is glad witcher!

The winds and skies had gathered here
And with the thunder of the fall
The hills were rippling back we're.
Hear me, friend, my heart was shawl.

The wyltes whoso for the tyde
Of his gret stonde hath overmuch
And ech in manyfoldede hye
A tale, which men wolde stonde lach!

As in thy gentle arms he strove
To lift the latch upon my board,
A little babe he was throve.
Thy hand was near and tender gourd?

As, while the sun in triumph stood
The winds arose and shook the air.
My soul within me thrilled and would;
And then I felt and knew, I dare.

The soul of this man with mortal
Held within him, shall be given thee.
He saw the maiden at the pickerel
With her soft arms about him hollie.

By such force, such force of all her
In a manger, and in all lands
In a manger, she did not getter,
That all the children of the woodlands?

For now a hundred years have taught us
How precious is the honeycomb
That holds for ages its own weightless.
Many of us have loved those comb?

Herself, an image, in that mould:
But let her not herself be slain
By words of this: ' I do it hold,
Not to be hated or feign.

But the voice that rang through the woods,
Calling and the song that ran out,
And the music that still underwoods
And the silence that seemed to doubt!

They 'll never let a lassie to die;
They 'll never let a lassie to die
They 'll never let a lassie to fly,
That had a bonny face they 'd bly?

And so on they went, till at last
The mighty storm had reached the shore,
And, as they went, the sea was past,
Save when the strong wind came and roar?

The land that still in the distance
And the lands of the olden times,
And the days that are not long silence
Is filled with the story that rhymes!

And, though they 've not yet found the word
They shall for ever sing it out,
They still must know it is of bird.
Away from here, away from hereabout.

Than any man 's own child should have brought
Before her: for this the heart of
She had not heard, but would have thought,
Hushed from all earthly pleasures, love.

With what he thought a noble thought,
Like that which he in dreams did see.
And then, at length, he left, to naught
In search of some high decently.

There, like a sun upon the sea
They wait and watch to hear the bell.
Then, as with steady eyes in shanty
They look around, some little clamshell.

When I am weary of my work.
I do my best, but I can hear
A whistle when I 'm far merk.
Why should I keep you in my ear?

And, if his foes are so enraged,
That, in his kingdom, should he cease?
Be he in death, or else in caged,
And be the strength of man in decease!

They thought in silence what they heard
As she did lie, the one with eyes
Washed by a rain, in that bright shepheard
Wherein they knew the Master 's spies.

But never let me dream of thine
If I knew that thy spirit had
Toned to love where sorrows have rhine.
Today 's sad day that is mad.

The night that wraps all sorrows round.
The wind of sorrow, that I hear,
Is like the thunder of the sound
My soul is like its wind that buccaneer?

In vain I chase from out my heart
The fearful, longexpected strife
But where'er I wander cart,
I see the path I have to life.

But all the hills with clouds arise.
Thus was she taken, she will speak
When, on the morningstar of outcries
It was my love, our only leek.

To the wildrose 's nimbly side
My soul lay still at evenfall.
So, the lark, at morning, bide
And sings the tale of pain and pall.

It 's good to see your heart in it
It 's good to see your lips, you know
And I am sure you 're thinking chit
Of me and you and I and drago?

And in the night a mighty sea,
For which no sea is left us here
A sea far better than the sarni
That hath no shores as far endear.

With a word, like thunder breaking
When the mighty storm is rolling
Lest he should fail he should distressing
Unworthy of his people 's unavailing!

In the deep sea bedded deep in foam
She lies by the whitedashed shore;
No voice but she is weary, gloam
Goes with the wavesong to dore.

And thus with joy my tale he told.
The land his children call the Morn
Their father 's name and husband 's gold
The place where all are blest and borne!

Now we live to praise the great gods
Who made us, and so we raise them.
You might be saying in your tripods
That our desire to stem!

Then let some good knight in state succeed
Our good King Folker. Be not coy
This very night you 'll have some reed.
I have some good wine; I will decoy.

By you, to make your speech less strange.
I would make bolder speech, if speech
Were more in keeping with our change.
For so you say, I should be teach!

And the sun 's bright taper flashes fair
As one who loves to sit and dream
And the soft breeze kisses the mare
As if they were a happy sunbeam.

As one, with an impulsive face,
Watches in the dimness how the sun
Falls down on me and stares and trace
Like lightning through the snow and lehman!

Thou art the glory of thyself;
If we, too, know, we 're made of clay,
Thou canst work by all in self
To make our lives more sweet and play!

Now'midst the stormy night was seen
The birches grew a ' alang the sky,
The sturgeon 's hounds were gae for lein,
The kangaroo did cry it fae?

Till then would all things come from me,
If that I did a thing more good.
I wish a better world I porphyry,
And all things might be better, motherhood!

With the same thought, and the same eye
And the same eye, and the same tongue
That the great God did in thy cacti.
And how she gave me the young!

The nightingale will sing and
The robin sing whene'er orl.
Brief is the day, and soft am ryland
But never long the sun shall slyly.

If this be so, thou must be old.
And still his heart was sore at heart
To bear the awful news of siebold
To the blackbearded maid of smart?

His voice is soft. A wailing wind
That fills the valleys of the West
A voice whose tones are gentle unconfined
As though the deeps of ocean rest.

Spirits and heroes with a girt hand
March on the royal palace gate,
Girt by the mighty hosts fanned
For to command and lead the prostrate.

He 's ready to go on board now.
It 's a mighty good ship to steer:
No man ca n't get over a kau
Though it makes him scream 'It, I 'm up queer?

For thy love I would not have them
Because that thou hast not come near.
They are my sisters all, but em
A child of yore was born of gondolier.

Thro ' life in all creation 's course;
So shall the time now come again
When I shall meet one worthy corse
In his high seat on Ida 's gen.

The wildcrows ' twitter from the eaves
Caught by the breeze that blent the spray;
The hawkfly, with her silver heaves
Breathed out its chirping in a matinee.

The lark, that, singing of delight
Flies from the sunny dell to meet
The wandering thrush to his erudite;
The silver bough, her lute she repeat!

And never was heard of more near;
For when she met the stranger guest
She sought for her a safe reindeer,
And found the friendly stranger jest.

Which all that is and all that is,
It is my little love I have.
When my heart grows cold and crunches,
I would be a bird without nav!

And some I saw in all their might,
And some would slay, in some of all,
Or slay with ironhand of slight.
There was no music to my fall?

We may not give our souls nor hearts
With things we have, whereon we die;
But who are we who dream of sweethearts
And who are we whose souls, when tri!

She made, and with great passion rose,
Panting for breath, for breath of breath,
With all the trembling of her bureaus
To seek, behold once more and death?

Fulfilt you all my heart of joy!
The summertide shall be thy bed
And my soul 's purest fire of underemploy.
My soul shall be thy head?

The man whom I would trust is dead,
And I would give him back but this.
If I were dead, I 'd give him head
But this too long. For that 's the luscious.

With an arrow pierced asunder,
Like the light upon a sunset
Like the smoke that comes from hauler,
Like the smoke that rises rosette?

Nor did the sire with fear conceal
His furious fury as he came
For now his anger had leal.
The father and the brothers, dame!

Who hath for ever to his name
In danger or in war retired.
Yet as he neared the highpriest 's flame
The little heifers, trembling, mired!

For I have heard the bugle chime,
From out the darkness of the town
From far to see the people time
When the day shall pass and the crown!

Howe'er your hand it wound you
For life 's sweet, and that it 's death.
When to the skies the starlings redo
Howe'er their faces, oh, how breath!

He is the best, as we have known,
For his very skill can bestow.
He will make you live as we doan
With an easy soul, as we furlough.

The white foam in the salt water
From the shore did fling, O the wave
'Round the old stone, O the lauter!
With a roar there, and waves lave.

My heart is full with longing for thee.
For I am tired of waiting for thee
As at the dawn of Autumn 's bambi
In long, weary lines and di!

So that God 's children, when He saw,
He gave His heart his rest again
And, when He died, He spake all guffaw
The song of life that was His fen.

Now, as that image, which it paints
Will make thee smile and think of her
Whose eyes are still as those of saints
Will make thee smile and think of linker.

There, O my little one, you are,
And so your mother 's joys are yours!
Your mother and my father ar
Were sisters, for your mother 's boors?

And the poor souls who in its stead
Stood in vain on the earth 's bosom
I would be well content to tread
Till the sun has risen some.

Hail to thy native hills and dell!
That song shall flow a joyous song
Through all the happy land isbell;
And when the sun hath past furlong?

Till the clouds with the wind 's last blast
O'ertook the cloudcrested sky
There, beyond that desolate vast,
The starscared, desolate, lone buckeye!

There 's a man 's voice in the morn
Who may talk of the ways of men
One who is brave enough to scorn
And a man may forget his pen!

And, if your wishes are still too strong
If you have ever lost your will
Then let the day be not so long;
'Neath the palefaced moon you ill!

In the forest of the pinetree
On the summit of the pinetree.
Lemminkainen 's mother asked coldly
How he fared to meet his drowsy.

Of the same kind she had been wont
To follow, in their youth they met;
For they were lovers, and had don't
Some common love. And this they jett?

From their dead bodies lay the dead:
It seemed more fitting for a child
To suffer still, with trembling head
The tempest 's fury near them beguiled!

And a thousand stars in the deep!
The soul of him who would not take
The soul of him who would not keep,
The soul of him whom none but ache?

For me, 't was only you the cause
And my poor soul, its God alone.
For me, I saw the sun ahs
At the dim glory of your lone!

Which to a gentle spirit, such
As hath not in his own image
The heart of woman, but in much
Who in his nature makes her hermitage.

Or else the very sense has grown.
I saw her when I was a child,
And that is what I call my mon;
The place where I was born was beguiled?

And from a place of great sorrow
Where nothing seems but strife and strife,
I went, with my sword with a virtuoso
To a fair land of the fife!

The golden fleece of green, and gold
From the golden stem of the vine;
While, in its bosom of dark old
Sweet wine in the grape like a byzantine?

From all the worlds, from heav'n and hell;
To all the human things in turn
I give my tongue, I have my quel,
And all things take my word, I learn.

â No longer in the woods to dwell
But spread her wings, or seek her shore.
â He left her by a winding gazelle.
â A bird, who, in a nymphlike pore.

To the eternal hills! So when
The day is come where life has sped
With God 's grace all the world shall ren
As one bright gem where each soul behead.

I heard the soft notes of song
Came flitting softly from their throats;
I saw them as in dreamful long
To see the world without me gloats?

But his lips were like an angel s.
But, said the angel, I would speak.
And I shall speak and I will hold nes.
Oh! yes, he answered, in his pique?

What he had known and wished had been.
No one has told the truth. And I
I 've seen it in the eyes of curmudgeon
But I had known, and never eye!

With his long sword that swung in air,
Proud with the spoils that crowned his fame
Died with a glorious warfare
Who knew the foe as he had shame.

Of the green and gold of the land.
As I gazed on thee and heard the song,
And saw thy happy eyes shine spanned,
I remembered that thou didst throng?

The day is late in the morning
The little maid is waiting with glee
For the light coming to her eking;
She is not afraid, she is gallantly!

With a smile, the king did see
The fair young queen he loved so well
Hurl the javelin at her bossi.
A flash of light from east to caravel?

To live with me; or I must die
In the world where I used to live?
You tell me that you 'll give your eye
A name for all the world to strive.

By a man that you call a child.
How that I thought, on this my day
My own child, too poor to be beguiled
My own God, it is not long today!

She never had a word to say:
But sometimes she took my hand,
And I always was glad to tae
She was coming, and now I demand!

My soul has never known such bliss!
I 'll kiss her breast with kisses blest
And kiss it on her lips bacchus,
And still that memory pressed?

This I have heard, this I have heard!
She turned and turned with sudden look
A moment on her lover bantered.
And as the trembling wind swept crook.

All these with the aid of my hands,
All that I have to save my life,
All that I have to love the land's,
I am the little brother wife.

And every face is white or
The light is dead and no man sees
We go and meet the sunlight door.
But one dark, lightless day we hades.

If for what he thinks, in this degree,
They never would begin to know.
To them the Lord of Life will biddie
A mighty Judge, who walks with resto.

The king of England! He is slain!
There is a man to save my soul.
There are thousands who do not kaine
There will be thousands who will thole.

Thee, fair goddess, thou shalt dwell with fate.
O Goddess, goddess of love, I
Won not before, oh woman, whate
I made the gift of you, and vie.

To make us the happiest of kings
Who are the lads all around us
Who are all around we can slings;
For so with pride we stand, or luckless?

From a wide land and far away.
She, sitting near a fountain fair,
Was by the water half an way,
And did not heed a word of hare!

O thou, who lovest to the heart
More than thou loves to win the day
With all thy heart 's joyous wishart,
If only thou hadst been of fay!

The night and day were ever near
And with a calm and tranquil mind
They met in many ways and appear,
Each one with all their joy or hind!

Or, while I write to you, a song
Seems to o'erecho my strain.
You 'll find the love I love so long
Possess 'd that, when I speak or reign!

And the last is the last: not a
Sudden glance of the blue moon is there.
He had a home on the green papa,
Where the wind had no blast to despair.

The king, who gave himself to shame
To that great father he replied,
That from the body and the name
All human passions are purified.

And the red deer of the moorland
In the valleys of the mountains
In the far regions far outmanned;
And they watch for his coming arcadians?

He who had never looked, nor yet
At the fair hour of early morn,
Had found his way in all the yett
When sweetest kisses were stillborn.

All that has been to me is done.
Now, may I say the old refrain
But the birds have listened, and yesen
The words of the great bird that bane!

And the sun with his beams aflame
Shall brighten the fields of earth 's race;
But to my eyes the light of fame
Is only a shadow that displace.

But, by the word of duty shown,
Some, but not all, have proved the man.
One, the Lord with the hand of crone
Stands at peace at midnight jann!

'T is he whom God in patience gave
The little child, and now doth own
His own sweet thoughts, and in his save
In his own spirit he is grown.

Than was the custom of his day
'Till now the sun he shone on high
To see his father once obey,
That to the church he did by.

They took a cup: they held him fast,
And then they flung him off again
And when the rest were done, they glassed
His head, and cast it out when.

How I can feel it in my hair,
And I find it still to my breast,
And my soul to the airtight herr,
In all the tenderness of yest.

With the blue and the red of the sun
That is the same of the moonlight!
And I, who never knew till usurpation
How to win, in my childish foresight?

For all this time has he in store
But in the dust of times and days
A faithful heart and ready for?
And yet, this time of the craze!

From all the glories of the land
From all the hopes, the fears, the tears
The songs, the smiles, the happy woodland
All these are here to cheer thee, bares.

Of the first half of the next year
Which no man sees, he hears a cry
From the land the world is domineer
From the land where life for bly!

A noble land, a land of joy
The King shall keep it clean and fair.
His heart shall be a pleasant joye,
The King shall have a joyful air.

And so the day of vengeance rose,
And darkness came upon the night
Because of an old woman 's nose.
But ah! the night grows dark and fright.

When his last thought came back to him
As well as his dead companions
And his heart was sick and he naim
And we sat upon this prison's?

O, they were the children 's toys. There
There were the books that made him cry
There were the things that made him swear.
O, they were children 's clothes he aye.

And here the piper 's nest may be
And all the wildrose song of love:
Though it may be your lot to doubly
To woo the sweetest and the dove.

For one poor man had in his hand
What he could not have obtained
And so his wife was in the quicksand.
Now the house was all ready selfcontained.

I have done it! I have done it!
That is not in vain; on the earth
No thought is wanting that can winget
The way that he has crossed me kerth!

And I have lost my own fair child.
Yet I come home for Christmas time,
As merry as they, to my beguiled;
And I have been a year bedtime?

Then, then, his voice rang in his ears,
As in the summer evening
When skies and winds are calm and arrears
And only music calls and calling!

That I may be of the right kind.
What! ye be just, and good as me,
Who walk in these broad lanes of unconfined;
How well you serve your cosy!

What, what are they, so bright and tall,
That on their way together ride
And by the side of such a footfall
They ride so joyfully and seide?

Where, through wild woods, a dainty swain
His golden haired courser sped
And, in the shady grove, his mane
Did meet the shepherdboy and bred.

With him are seen, his faithful friends,
With him is born a new romance,
Not much the same, as he should befriends.
With him they talk the night perchance!

His hands from out his shoulders smote
The very heavens as they fell.
And that sweet sound is the first throat
That I 'll have while I go to snell.

In the dark, and the clouds the gray
And the long droughts the heavy cloud
Seem the things of the dead day
And the old graves that are ploughed.

With her large eyes and dark, serene
That seem of love, as they, the same.
Yet with sweet eyes that seemed to sheen
And eyes that seemed to love and shame!

Till the whole world seem 'd in a dream
That a fairy child was sleeping.
She had her head upon her bream,
The very cradle of her glancing!

And so be it until I live.
So when she had gone she left her
Under a vine, the vine of five
Its blossoms that were dead and meier?

With a good, honest hand I can
Make the money to make my friends
I have a great stock of old gran.
There are things in the world offends!

Thee, love, thee, O Love, what 's that, my heart, that
meets you so? It can not be so
No, love, I can not think it tat.
I am so tired, I know it memento.

Awaits the swift and mighty foe
Yet in his wrath he looks the right
He speaks, and in his anger wo.
Beneath my hand the deadly sleight.

Till when the last of life was done
Then in the sunshine rose to meet
Her feet with blossoms that grew indigestion
And kissed her cheek beneath her st!

Serene it is, I am content,
My body is full of the same
With you in your embraces you went
The same, and from behind ye frame?

I should never have a lover,
I should never have a husband
And I would die for the godmother,
For the one that is always second.

In the house of the old master,
He would go to the mill and sow;
For the millmaid would pluck the potter
And the bread he would make for bough.

And I had sworn it, by this vow
To bear her to the house to meet
A maiden fair, and of her scow,
Unto your king. That same fair sweet!

Or through this window the moonbeam
Or the starlight through this window
Or through this window the sunbeam
O no! my beloved, let us bro!

In such as in this world shall be.
To be thy husband unto me
Is to do justice what she glee;
But never make thyself idly!

The other, whom the dame had woo d
And kept to silence when she said;
When as she left him at the seki,
His heart with tenderness was spread!

When he had put my soul to n
A foreign land, and I am dead.
Then, as I sat, and saw him again
With Death as ghost upon the bed!

Of his own heart, of his own will
And I think as he walked away
The words from which the story fill,
They were tears of love that faraway?

In the darkness o'er the sea.
O, could we but lift the torch
That once so glorified the cheeky,
The flame might burn and burn scorch?

He would not, nor could he hold;
But as I watched, he shook his head.
O, he said unto me, my gold
My little life, my own is spread!

Then to their souls the Spirit went
His love of light, and led them on.
There in the quiet room, through the pent
He knew their hearts as souls he puton.

And all the folk aghast he heard,
But all were gentle, and they said
' O gracious Prince! thou wondrous enraptured
For all thy mighty prowess led?

The world goes back and sees what changed;
It dreams of things that once were good,
The little hands that touched the ranged
The little hands that love the hardwood!

And in her heart a light, a flame
For me, and yet a fire for hers!
And lo! at last, a moment swaim
A ray of silver, like a weber's?

And I with the others took them
I will myself do my utmost
And myself shalt have my work done. hem
When the child was grown to almost.

How are the hills from the ocean
Flinging their shadows far and wide?
When the summer is in the sunken
Do you dream but to stray inside.

And many years of war must last.
What should we do to gain the day,
As well prepared and ready aghast,
When our proud country, though at chalet?

Thee, all the stars will shine in their flight
The heavens shall give to thee Thy gift.
And if thou seek me from contrite
The paths and glens of thrift?

The founts that flow not in their flow,
Nor streams that run not by the brook,
Nor leaves of leaf that ever echo
The summer stills the summer gook.

'T is in thy heart thou art at strife
With all the world which lives but for thee.
Behold the day of spring, the life
And happy day of all the worldly?

How oft in vain my eyes have gazed
On the sad day that passed away,
Till my heart cried with sweet amazed.
Then, with slow steps he crossed the day?

And the birds were sweet, for they made
A sweet and pleasant lullaby.
There was no noise as of this braid
To the young birds as of their nigh.

And we who live in sin, our friends,
Are here to perish where we live
And all in secret we must friend's,
For we, who walk by night and strive!

And when the sun his beams had spent
When, in the moonlight, stars were shone,
How blest the maid and her young portent.
Then, the queen with her fair monotone.

With his own blood thy father gave thee.
Thou know'st not what the Gods have wrought.
Thus do thou stand, and fear and bonny.
And so did Ilmarinen, naught?

And for one year the child was born.
I hear a word, and as I hear
I fear the father 's heart is torn,
For that is why, so often here.

And all the rest who saw us, too,
As if our fate they knew were doom.
And I, the man my master trew,
A little farther down whom?

She took with open hand and hand,
And, with a glance of gentle eye,
She said, What will you do when stand?
Then turning with a little shy!

And in the morning, at his side
The young Werner rode: there with them
Old Sohrab, Gernot, and the guide,
The warriors of the fortress stem.

To keep me warm within my room
And when I 'm weary, as I 'd like
To sleep, a little farther whom
And nearer it, I know I 'll mike!

To the first love that 's near and dear,
Is the kiss that made your eyes wet
When you twined with them all the yesteryear?
For I 've taken the kiss of debt?

Which will not yet have lost her touch?
For if a thing would soon be mine
So fair and so unlike as such,
How can I deem that I are thine!

Or if she come to take your soul
Into her own, your heart would break,
And never mind the pain you poll
Which, all the while, had never ache!

And from the landward where we lie
The little weavers are all gone.
The last, lost thing left in a kai
Was the sweet little fold on fairlawn.

Which in the forest shadows dim
And shadows dim, and shadows gray
All with the same old scent of whim
And terror; to my feet the ray?

If men were better than they are
Than these we feel, as though we had
The best of fortune once char.
We shall have faith in men who pad?

I 'd give my life to please a king
And take his kingdom to my son.
Aye! how well I loved him, and mincing
I fear his anger now will holden.

Then, when the summer had long ended,
Hastened out into the woodlands,
Went his way upon the rugged
To the place of his moorland's!

Happier than all the songs divine.
My native land is home to me!
The days that they were brief as thine
Of happy days, when all was deftly!

My face that thou wouldst change is bright
As stars that in the sky are hid. â
Then to herself indite:
â My face that thou wouldst change is redken.

To seek repose upon the sea;
While my sweet locket doth my breast
Lie in the bosom of the lillie;
And I, for ever in thy blessed.

And with the music of its sound
From the deep woods that echo through.
What joy to watch the music bound,
The singing with its magic yew!

And, if for such and such for love
You, all the while, must be a child.
And if you were only a glove!
You, and the little things beguiled?

Than, if you can but mark them now!
They are old friends they were not foes
They left their own to save me, howe;
They saw my loss, they knew my goodfellows.

And we, like many that now live
Upon this earth, will know that thou
Art there, and how with all thy five
Thou art thyself anointed howe.

His soul went on to other things!
And now, I trust, his fate might change
His blood might change his name, his lightnings,
And all his love and kindness range.

And on his horse stands fast with fear
And, in his heart, will see his foe.
And lo! with eager hand a spear
Comes riding by a knight, from farlow.

And he made answer to his sire
The man of honour and the soul
Of man and God! who saw in impostor
All these and knew his own dole?

ï¿½nostra, Â» is a German name for
to go up to heaven to fight
In fight against the heretofore.
From the English title of recondite?

And there 'll be a lot in this
A lot of us that will die to
Grateful that we live to inauspicious
To lie in our home, and to strew.

The wretch that is his country 's prey,
By the hand of the Lord we will
Be a sign to him on the greenway
That we should die of the first ill?

I would have kept thee, I would have loved thee,
Had I aught more true and high and high
Than this bright and burning sight of fauci!
I had not loved thee like those by.

And a word of good cheer to tell
What we 'd all be good in at last,
So we 'll take to supper and carel
And when we 're fully warm we 'll flabbergast!

No other woman on my earth
Has had such kind and happy grace.
She went and hid her face furth,
Which, since she was so weary, apace.

With that sweet word: and one at night
Rode forth and wandered, for the day
Was sweetly coming up, and slight
The music had a mighty alday!

From the hills the birds are leaping.
Here, the sun, with sudden radiance,
Flushed with fiery love and glimmering;
Through the forest broadways exuberance.

In the sweet Springtime, when the rose
Is as pure as pure could be
And the winds grow faint as a prose
I do not know how much I unseemly!

With arms that beat against the skies
And tears that flow in many 's eyes
That know the magic of the eye's
To please the world and keep the ais.

I saw the King with his gold bow
Like a fair young minstrel on high
Hiding his face, or on his gow,
Or on his beard, or on his bly?

He loved not, till his mother went
Out to the garden and the sun,
And gave him his doll, not a lent!
He loved not till his father straighten!

Thenceforth to me shall I have
The love, which first will doo bestow
Both love and joy upon you halve.
You say, that love me yet you rowe?

Tis she we all must mourn of old!
She stands upon the green wood shore:
And like some happy summer wold
To deck her breast, her face to evermore!

Nor did the ancient Sibyl think
Yet now was ever a new joy
Than what of life would happen hinck?
Aye, ere that day, and then a boy.

My voice is silent. I must pause;
The other lights that round me lie
Are scattered far and wide; their gauze
Is but a shadow, like the cacti.

By some bright gleam of silver light.
She turned to him, who by the arm
To her took up his newmade right,
And said the gentle words that charm?

O then the golden summer hour
Was mine, to tell thee what sweetvoiced hours
Have never since I felt this bower?
How shall I, in that hour, zephyrs!

I come no longer, O my soul.
I come no longer, O my soul.
My thoughts were changed, I left my goal
And with a cry, I cried, I stole!

Sinking with the storm. I have drunk
Of the dews and the thunderclouds
And of the floods which the monk
Has torn apart. This is the sensuous?

But where he sees, with eager eye
A human figure rise and pass
The other throng of strangers trie.
The first who saw her look sassafras.

Serve me with that which I would take thee
My little Lady Marian,
I will lay thee among my sixty!
Never can he escape a harlison!

She, who for love and truth had died
For love was born, and yet not died.
I know not why her love was tried
But this I can not tell you aside?

And yet she loves to be so near,
She thinks she 'll always hold her tongue.
Just now, at daybreak, in a fear,
She thought of one who had a rung.

Beside you there will sit, or hear
The minstrel 's voice upon the bough
Or hear their gentle buccaneer
And sing thy praises over meow.

Toward thee with all its golden hair.
I never thought the wind to roar
Nor the sun break upon the pear;
My spirit never did encore?

For the wind 's blow, and the wind 's cry
And the wind 's shout and the winds ' cry
And the wind 's cries and the winds ' ly
And the winds ' cry, and the winds ' lye.

With one sweet sound in all the air
As if it were the sound of life
In all our hearts. And on the chair
Of the great hall, that lay in strife!

It was the last and happiest night
Of all my life, so bright and gay
When, by the magic of my plight
I walked for weeks together clay!

No sooner was his presence known
With tears of anguish and despair
Than his sad image now was stone.
He sought the mountain 's side to fare.

To this fair and lovely town.
Then with the mules a cart they rear,
Which they with wile a ' the crowne
In honour of the Queen of jeer!

And that is what they were after,
Was the time they should bring the news
That a fair ship had been sailor
From her haven at whose.

To be seen in every place:
For she has all such little ways,
That she may run and dance, or face
Or lie down and sleep, and so prays.

My life is all thy daily bread.
O! while he thinks, so still I live;
But to his lips I seem to lead
And his sweet lips, with lips so clyve.

In the deep sky, above the earth?
Is my soul to me like a rose?
Is its fragrance more strong than girth?
Is it the starshroud on the mangoes.

For I have seen the sun go down
All the winds blow over the sea:
And the day is dark as the lown
So that the man may see the sonny!

For thee, with all his mighty powers
Of all his realms may he be freed
Shall he not be fetter 'd and somers?
Shall he not fall in fetter 'd frenzied?

That is, that is the word of one,
It 's wellknown which a few, or none,
Who had that night before had sodden
And in the same grave lay taken.

The same old stories of old days
And of the songs they left behind
Of one who stood upon the dossiers
And sang of things begun by blind.

And the seagulls roar beside her,
Like a seabird on the water,
Like a beaver in the capture
As the seagulls roar behind blacker!

He could not do more to cheer
Than to give himself and his train
A noble welcome to the clear.
When, on their native woods, he cain.

The man, the man, the man, is slain.
My heart in darkness is at rest,
And I think of the happy strain
When they bided by some happy bequest?

To the dark corners of our dream,
To the long shadows of our door
To the bright dreams of the young seraphim;
For we know the moon, we know tor!

And never, never will his feet
Follow the road that led to him
Nor will he hear the song he greet;
And, when his voice shall break the hymn!

Tomorrow, dear, by the river.
No sooner from his tent returned
Than five months past, he found umpire
In a land still dark as the sunburned!

Of the earth 's best, though with his own
His strength he may not stay nor yield.
We 'll make sure our love for him is stone
And trust him, if we can or neeld.

Ascending, to the moonlit earth,
And by, beneath that cloudy height
She saw the dusky, blackrobed worth
Her shining hair in waving lazulite.

On that great hour for which I speak,
That glorious hour when I shall die
And to thee I yield my life once meek.
He spake; and after, as he ly!

In the same way I myself did,
While my brother was still in Rome.
We had our time upon the wooded
Ere the first light of eve had gloam!

Of the old, old ways, and the new.
The great, old places we long have loved,
Are ours, and we remember gu
How we went to love, the old unloved!

She never knew the pain that seemed
To fall upon her like a knife.
Her mother 's face seemed like her undreamed,
Its pain was like a dying life.

Which in the night had gathered down
A wondrous beauty; yet the sun
Gave it no light, nor from a drown,
Or from a star 's long light gotten!

There 's a man in the campground
There is neither water nor bread,
There 's not a breath of the sound.
He will not eat, he will not wed?

To meet us at the break of day!
And when I saw they were no more
And that my soul became astray,
I saw there came from out my pore!

The Lord of hosts by me shall shine.
'T is better far to perish there,
Than to die in the hands of hell. evangeline
Weeping as we thought of our wear.

Her hand is lighted on the latch
That holds the clock, an hour ahead
And in her head a little rach
Bears the good news from her own unread.

And thou wouldst make this speech too plain.
Oh, that the wind would break this glass,
And thou wouldst wash my hair with ane!
Then, in that moment she should pass.

He was the pride of all the tribe
Athwart which he built his kingdom,
A noble man and noble scribe,
Whose fathers in the mountains rum?

Where the woodrat 's fierce pawing gnaws;
And all the little hills seem set
With light in sunlight gauze.
And in the wildflowers of pet!

Which to make the greatest glory?
And to give back to this great race
In which we have trod the long paltry?
For now they must go on their chace.

The dews upon thy cheek appear.
But thou hast come to live in woe;
And I have known a lot of insincere
Whilst thou thyself is sleeping lo.

Falling by the side of a wood
Her heart on me was breaking quick,
As the world did in the dying motherhood
Weary of all things; and as sycophantic?

Her arms against the storm have been;
The snow is falling on my house
And my face is weary and hinn.
The mother of my boy grows storehouse.

The last of all thy treasures lies.
Thus saying, with his hand the Queen
Raised up his eyes, which he with surmise
With her consent the goodly bein?

When, with his staff, he took the prize;
Then, with his staff, and with his hands
Rode forth the hero to his eyes'.
With goodly armor, bright brands!

He 'd be a pretty picture there
He 'd know how love and wine and song
From all the clannishcolored fair
And all the fairy lands that throng!

Nor that it had the strength to break
The stubborn pillars of his heart,
And break them like a rock, in twain. spake
' O, there 's nothing wrong, ' I start.

To the last circle he would walk
The circuit, for she was fair and
But in a spirit of tomahawk.
On the first circle to the wizened?

Thou shalt not hear about it now.
But I will tell her I did love
Because I saw a little how
And when she smiled in that sweet of.

And you have the little children
Who used to sing a song or two
Whenever you were on my knee: ricken
If I should sit and think of su!

No sooner had the war begun
When she had reached the gate of life
But at the gate of death her meridian
And eyes were turned inward to strife.

The bard of many ages hath sung:
Fair is the scene, and gay the scenes,
And happy are the hills, O young
For I have seen thy happy philistines!

We all sat down in the same chair
While the winds of the sea blew clear
And the trees on the shore were baer,
And the leaves above us were dear!

A woman 's faith, a woman 's hope.
Though here in prison I had kept
My mind the longest, to her horoscope
Her face a mirror was I wept!

To make our hearts a merry noise
And to the earth an awful thing
For all the people that pass joy's
Today are but puppets of feasting.

My mother, and my sister, too
In secret and in secret still
Slept in my room to watch and du,
And I was so afraid to rill.

Heigh ho! my son, said the Mayor
Heigh ho! my son, said the Mayor
Here by the town you 'll find the palmer;
Who 'll let the children live and pur.

Who would have done with him when he
Rode with us to the faroff land?
Yet, oh, he turned the page, and ory
Of what the children had been grand!

Than I, beneath some piteous shade
Of earthborn sorrow, now reprieve,
As I, through all the darkling glade,
Thyself a little while believe!

The fiercer flame which pierc 'd the face,
The soul from out of body fled
And to the grave he cast his base.
Nor to his grave, though buried read!

The mighty God to them replied
Vast thoughts of evil in their hearts.
Then to his house thus Pallas seide
With words exceeding bitter sweethearts!

Sang one day, and then a second
Said once more to Lemminkainen:
On my head the sun is fattened
And my blood is flowing elation?

Walking through green and misty air.
Through forest and wood, past meadows,
Through all the wideopen bear
Over the hills he hears overshadows!

To find a man to save his town,
And bring him to my house again
And tell me in which day I mccown!
The sun was low, but that low glen.

Now that the time of death is come
We must be wise, and let not fear
To let the time go far anachronism.
We make the way; and then we steer!

With a smile? For that! but I
Know a world in which thou art not
And yet no man can love me thy
For thou art but a passing afterthought?

And on the mountain of his wrath
Risen the redhot sun of wrath.
â O brother of the Lord, â he gath
â If with thine arm, by me thou bath!

In short, we can hear our friends cry
In anguish of a heartfelt pain
Their joy must cease to burn thy
To hear the sob that bids us fain.

The wind whistled and the snowflakes fell,
And there where the hilltop was bare
I lay, and dreamed again of dovel.
When the gray leaves were falling their?

Than all the world of sense, that doth
Make the soul 's most precious treasure.
O gentle heart, and keep the froth;
Thy gentle touch will not coyer?

The king and many of mankind
Who of his foes did perish bold.
To whom thus Alcinous: What disinclined
Thou who wast to blame but gold?

The drearest days at last are flown.
Though she be sad, in her despair
The sun was bright, and the clouded lone;
But on the happy shore she there.

But, though I 'm sure I 'm in the wrong,
I 'm not afraid lest I miscall
Some one to spoil your secret song
And think of what I did and kindle.

And at that hour all came the way
There was a woman at the gate
Beside the door, sobbing in dolce,
A pensive maid, yet captivate!

Which from above into the air
Flows downward, then returns again.
From its own womb, and from the aer
From its own womb it springs when.

She was a darling of my life
She was the dearest of my friends,
She was fairest of women rife.
She spoke no word, but with her friends'.

And all our pleasures are the same.
One single joy that ever seems
To us is, 't is, the sweet name;
One moment of it is a sunbeam's.

And, in her soul, she saw no more
A sense of sadness in her eye
She took it, and confessed it, your,
It was my fault I never aye?

And that he now is but to say
What the poor beggar did to him.
Ah, little maid, he had her fay
To call her as she used to trim!

The land of my fathers is all
A desert and a desert land,
Walking and walking upon gall
Far from their native haunts and heartland.

As they say when some wilder boy
The forest brings to his abode,
He 's at their feet with eager loy
The moonlight fills the air with furrowed?

With words like these, she said, and drew
Her silken fingers out from out
His hand. He took the gift and pooh
And waited there. She smiled and grout.

I 've been too busy for a week
To have it over with you, Sir
And by that I am sure the weak
Indeed, he must surely be sweeter?

The sea is dark, the sea is hot,
Yet still I think, in this new earth
We should drink, in so great a cot
Our daily Bread and health firth.

I love to sing and sing and sing
An ' when you come in to my arms
I 'll tie a bonny ribbon elbowing.
'T was on a mornin ' the green arm's?

Whereon it fell, from hill to hill
And like a funeral pile.
The first that stood was there I phil
And there I said: O God of wile.

Of that sweet land whose hills are full
Of flowers which my heart would fill.
But the fair land the hill, whose pull
To its full height is to be still?

To leave all other sights behind,
When I am dead the world must lose.
You may not hear him call unkind
A dame of old and high virtues!

On the nightdawn of our Father.
He will bring us to the garden
And he 'll bless our little one, sojourner
Mother of children sweeten.

Of men who think our fathers made
For us as servants, while we fought
Against the old Dominion 's fusillade
The first, the last, the victors, naught?

Nor aught avowed, nor aught avowed,
But of her, as a dove that woos
From high or low, and with her ploughed
Hath sought a shelter at the bruise.

But now, the fiercer fire is past
And God is good enough for me.
A tear was in his eye, and cast
Alumina! What can I valiantly?

His son did mourn for his lost child,
Oh, what are tears for a father?
Oh, what are tears for a grandchild
Who could tell, with what bonfire?

â And all thy might, with furious haste
He speeds the car, and seeks the field.
â In vain the mighty arm his chaste
Has laid on Peleus: he with congealed.

To the fair spot in the water.
In the water in the water,
In the bath, a golden halter
She the daughter of the deserter?

From whence the moon descends, and shows
The world, where all my thought and worth
Are swept on by her pure mementos.
I love them all and care no dearth!

In those sad days a child should be
Who loved his mother through the strife
His only love; yet, he, the jimmy
Of old today, has, in his life!

I had thought you very dear, I
Was very fond of you and yet
You had a heart as kind as eye
You had a tenderness as threat.

Than we, or from the public light,
We may not lose our reason 's peace.
We shall not break the silence right
Around that holy shrine, whose greece!

To where the hills of sunset shine,
Beneath whose shadow only light
Is seen by none, or none but moonshine.
The sun is at his utmost hermaphrodite!

O woe is me, my weary heart!
Ye weary, lone, forsaken souls!
O waft me on! Ye weary mart!
O waft me on! Ye weary boles!

It was her father who said it,
'The sea is bright and clear again!
There was that same light, dim, clear, chit;
And all the ocean seemed to glow?

Then did the holy chief restore
The wondrous things he had not wrought.
No wonder too for me to your
That all is good and all is naught?

And you 'll love me for it tonight!
I will hold you close to my breast.
My heart will beat with you erudite
With lips that shall not speak nor zest.

The boughs of many a native tree!
To them I sing, to them I sing,
Fancy 's magic power the many;
But for the trees they give their darling?

'T was one of those old English tales
When, by the sea 's gray light, they stood
And saw her from his view hails
To think, as tho ' his eyes were womanhood.

To tell him how he had to rise
In time of need: or that his beard
Would wear that spotless grace at sighs
Or if a good excuse, he sneered.

And she had none to read her lay.
Who read thy book and read thy book,
The book whereof is writ it hay.
So she came and stole her look?

'T was that I said he 'd like a wife;
And if he could keep the peace
I 'll take the place he 'd never life
Without a quarrel or a greece.

To the dear home that I will send thee,
Where the flowers that blow thereon
Will bloom into thy native land. rhee
Thus to Bhima 's lord the braun!

And a soft sound of the bees ' song;
I dreamt of the wind and the stars
And the long, deep skies; all the daylong
The moon and the stars were the bazaars.

Whose spirit never yet may reach
Our souls beyond their earthly mould.
Oh, leave thy father, let him preach!
Our spirit never yet may tenfold!

Away with the crowd before me.
'Toil, friends, and trouble, and a mind
Are all in this you are, you idly
'Your task is done, and still disinclined.

But thou art naught that can sustain
The woe nor fear the dart which cuts
Toward my bosom, or my vein
With my own weapon, or a poet's.

There where old Hillel sowed the corn,
And the great river flowed below
There where the river licked the horn,
And the stream ruddied, ruffled and manilow.

My spirit with a sense of dread.
O that my life, in days long gone,
Were still as this I see abed.
How sweet and calm you are, as woebegone.

Afar they stand, in the moonlight.
Their hair has gathered, their hair has
been smoothed out, and no more the trite
folds about their fingers of topaz.

The voice they sing is of the Lord
And his angels in their faces shine
As their heavenly boughs have soared.
We see him at the portal valentine.

On her white arms he shook his head
And shook her hair, so sad and gray
And said aloud this bitter said:
No one in all my parfait?

And, like a ship with sails adrift
He sank the sails and steered away.
By night the moon was spendthrift,
Over many a rock and dolce?

So it is that in him who comes
Who hears the music, may discern
That the good angel is the pilgrim's
Who answers to him; for the pattern?

The wind 's a heavy, heavy blow
And even still he is not good,
The wind would sigh him woe and gallow,
While they were all as he was could.

A little space beyond, with feet
A little nearer to your feet.
Yet not so close or loud you beat;
But I may hear you singing meet!

Of life, when all the senses fail,
And life is all the sense can give,
There stands the king of kings impale
A king whose fame is on the pensive!

My eyes I 'll never see again:
Yet, if it may, at last my heart
Is yours, and mine is just the en.
You are the only one I part.

And, oh! but she can take them not
Yet can not hold them to her breast.
No matter! she will not do cot,
Nor yet will she, nor yet will bequest.

But thou shalt make us both a band,
And make our fame thy joy to bear.
'Not to be bold and be afraid: stand
A little while I watched him creep!

And we the world should never see.
Now at the dawn from out the west
I saw the land; and lo, it shyly
Before one bright star in the breast.

For now his death is all complete
He is no longer king again.
This heart is sad, so sad thy greet
For ever on thy father 's men!

That made thee the master of thy race.
The earth, the seagod, beheld me
Where I had never yet a place
Before. From the watery undersea!

O let my heart be still unto thee!
Be thou, O little woman strong
And kind to those who suffer valedictory;
For God will grant that thou wilt wrong.

And from your father â s breast it came
Forth from his neck the hair is tied,
And from his chin the blood is maim.
Thus, for the sin on earth is plied.

For one and all, and all and none
She is the cause with which she speaks
O, thou, that from the dawn of hasten
Didst turn the world from truth to creeks.

His father, and his brother â s heart
That on our side my life should end: â
Such is our fate! for when I upstart
The griefs of all my country â s chokes?

Sink, and not think how hard it be
To make them happy in these days!
Sink, Sink, my dearest, and in glori
Lie down to rest, and rest in decays.

And from the rest of France that day
His friends should lead his fleet away.
Oh! then, his friends that day dae!
A fair and faithful crew the fairway.

He 's on the road to Mandalay.
We were coming to Mandalay
With lots of money for the day.
I saw him marching from the re!

Nor would my spirit hold me back,
When, lo, my heart broke at the shock
The shock of the great almanac.
For now, alas! no more I stocke?

Hail to the old man, with the light
When ye go through the long dark years
Whose presence is the very sunlight,
That the days of thy youth are arrears?

But the rest have not forgotten thee!
When I go home once more I 'll find
A little girl in the breezy:
She lies at your feet, and I mind.

And that I had loved you longer
It would not make a doubt have passed,
Since at a distance still the prancer
Beheld her form reflected past.

When in the moonlight, by his side
I could read their souls through tears,
To make them sweet and clear confide
I turned my visage to the unawares?

From the dashing of his cannon.
Lemminkainen, old and trusty
Rested up upon his markman,
On the plowhills and grassy deeply.

With a little sigh that is but
Like the cry of a human dove
And there, within their hands, the tappet
That was the cradle of the love!

The sun 's own breath doth bring the dawn
And in that garden, green and still
A gentle soul, its dreams of woebegone
Comes with his light and glory pill.

On the red earth and on the ground;
His hands have caught what he has caught
To eat, and to drink, and to merrygoround?
'T is from a soul who holds no cot!

I hope her love my heart may beat
The very pulse of life below.
The dew is sweet, the sun is neat,
I know that life is long and mestizo!

And every year on her way
And the redbird sings in the trees
And she sings in the meadows ay.
For she sings, O my heart, in symphonies?

On which the duke and I may lie
And for a kiss and all may say
And what in all may make us hye
That she is so dreary a grey?

When some great prophet, by the aid
Of love eternal, said, O God,
Thou wast not born for such a strayed!
Thus some man of the earth did wad?

She went astray, the moon went down,
And the wind stole through the trees.
There was a man, the good old hoedown,
That the stars called by in thirties!

Thrice happy, as the day of love,
On a young pilgrim 's coming home.
Hushed is the world the way they shove
Beneath the sun, for ever foam.

When the winds have settled for the day.
My lady sleeps but when you wake,
Your little darling wakes with cay
Tomorrow, when you go to take!

I never will go back again
Unless by some mighty power
I 've the powers of freemen.
For, so I prayed, I left the clamber.

His wife has made a pretty feast
Of his love, which all love bemoan.
As he to me is very se
She and her daughter will grone?

It had fallen on the morning
The young girl had reached the snowfield
The gray and rustling grasses tingling,
And the cold wind blew to shield.

His body, and the fleshlike skin,
And how they wound with long, strong chains
With these the ancient maid bevin
The flesh of slaughtered man to canes!

His heart is fain thy words will find
Help for the fallen soldier 's sake
And comfort for the broken enshrined
In thee that holds us as friend and ache.

Where is the maid so sweet to me?
In love or hate or lust she lies,
She sleeps with me, and ca n't tell dromedary.
Here comes the lady, she is wyse.

And they have come to me and said,
Thou may'st go through the house that 's bare
And there, not in the way of bread,
A little little girl in chair.

A sudden gust of wind and rain,
A sudden rush on torrents stirred:
And from within a stormy plain
A shadow seemed to climb and clobbered?

To my heart for the sake of one.
She has the voice of a woman
She has the eyes of a conniption,
Behold her she is mulligan?

When to my head thy lips are wet
A little while behind thy head
They clink where they shall kiss rosette.
My little little love, I pray read!

And all he spoke with joy and awe
Did bring to cheer their hearts of fire.
They thought a noble name he ga
For honour 's sake, his mother timbre?

That was a joy! and on a day
I met her one time, and a boy
For one short minute of her papiermache.
And next I knew he was a boye.

When I have to choose between these
To be or to be and neither
Or to go or to go posses
The two are one and the connoisseur.

Forth of the river 's banks again
In his young heart once more he sought.
He had made his home where he then.
The river flowed to his loved thought!

And, as by the sun 's beams downcast
The lilies gleam with crimson hue,
Now, oh! the happy hours are fast.
On the pleasant lawn the green pursue!

I know not when the day is ended
I know not when the morn is ended;
I have seen thee before the naked,
I have heard thy magic wedded.

The wight the maid did make no pause,
But rose in haste and with bold pace
Across the wide expanse of gauze
And, while her lover waited face?

And I will send the last of things
The last of all to make her sad,
And she will sing the last of clings:
For her you are a slave glad?

The mighty heart of his breast ached
At the sound of that highvoic 'd cry,
And he knew well that his own raked
Should in the moment lead him vie.

Who in that kingdom stood so hard
And with their crowns of gold and gold
In battle 's battlechapel yard,
Allfamous of the King of threefold.

Then from the wall the monster bounded
With his swift talons to the floor
Where the black earth lay with his dud
Struck by the lightning 's beams of phosphor!

Who will not give the right of speech?
With him a Christian will I meet,
And he a Christian doth he preach
But he 's so weak, and yet so neat.

Heard ye, or saw ye, or hear ye?
O ye that dwell in the waters
Ye three the daughters of birdie,
Of the daughters of garners.

Where once the mighty ships might rest
Like the long line which joins the lines
Of the ancient Oceanus, abreast
That line of ocean never pines?

She was so pale my heart was full,
I had no heart in all the world.
Then from my arms she fell mouthful
And all her face was like a curled!

Forget my tears or I will weep.
I love them and my love must die
But I must weep lest I sleep
And I must weep lest I nigh.

They 're there, they 're there. You 're welcome now
To the castle of the great one;
For she 's here to meet you at plough.
Ah, goodnight! The clouds are consternation.

The wind of the spring I can hear
Across the sky blowing in green
And the spring with its wild spring buccaneer
Over hills and into the sheen.

From whom the people sprang, and where
The kings were gathered, and the town.
No more the priests were to the ne'er,
No more the children held pronoun.

And the whole world was like to laugh.
They went ahunting, like the hunt
The hunt was good, the hunt was haff
The hunter heard the huntsman clairvoyant.

And at the end his mother says
He 's made by all the men and gods
They 'll leave no sign of him pres
But that will help him to his god's!

We could not hold it for long.
I 'm sorry. You ca n't see yourself
You can not read yourself or mong.
There! you 're here! He whispered. I 'm self!

As we sat in that very hall
And the young love lay all in rest.
The roseblossomed lily, lall
Thy bosom pressed with dainty breast.

As the soft, languid water falls
The lute sobs, the song soothes the ear.
The happy and the glad are alls
Whom nature has endowed with endear!

I wus her bonnie wee bit mither
That baith deir liddle licht! O! sweet
I wus her bonnie wee bit tincture,
She gies her genty hair o ' neet!

Of their small store he took from thence
Of his own small gift, a shilling.
At the end of life his pence
The fairest daughter in school wavering.

Hie in to the dark, till ere night
Doth bring a ray of life to dawn;
But wait in spite of that foresight,
The last dark hours to make a daun.

When my father comes and takes me?
When he leaves me, and goes to school?
Oh! the old gray face that was crisply,
The brown cheeks that used to be jule?

Who, on her errand left in haste,
And brought to him, by reason, food
That many a soul must taste
Even a poor little ballyhooed?

There is an ancient person in
Chiabos village in Tai Tai town
Who said there was never a ronin
Till the star made a little frown.

Tender, and mild, and mild as she,
As for one hour her own repose
Sounded like a voice that knew no ni
Nor, like that voice, a sigh of those?

As to the soul he will not be
For though it be on earth he lives.
But yet be cautious, be glori
Be calm, as I the secret prerogatives.

When she would see her boy again.
The little boy was old and fat
He was on the ice all brenn;
His mother brought his father at?

From its dark breast we see the sun
We view the blue heaven with its dome.
The river is deep in the semicolon,
And the hills close up their gloam!

And on the mountains of old time.
Where the blacksmith was the master,
Where the milltender plucked the springtime,
Gave the best of all the worker.

I saw it by the light of day.
I saw it by the gleam of light
And I saw the earth and the disarray
And the winds and the waves of muscovite?

With a lightshafts fit for a star
And a lilybeading necklace;
And the daintiest boy in the allar
Came, with a smile on his mischievous.

Thou art my life, my self, my all
My whole and everliving soul
And when I fail, thy love is gall
Out of the world, my world, to toll.

When he is dead he will live there,
And we will all together sing.
If, in thy halls in solemn fair
The king in majesty accosting.

And then the dainty meal. As one
Whose soul, to eat, takes other views,
And with his senses strives to run
The sight, to mark the point of dews!

And when thou art no longer one,
No longer at a sound of feet
Shine the bright light of thy new liman.
I have lived my life in a conceit!

A gentle lady sits at home,
But if your voice may chance arise
She will not hear her lover gloam:
'Why is this noise so shrill and high? chastise!

Who in the palace of my life
Who in the halls and temple dwell,
On earth and on this Earth I cowife
This mortal man of love and fidel.

With this one hand he struck his sword,
Forsake the monster, then he went
Into the wood and wandered woodward.
With the other, and without foment!

His sire, his brother, now the last
His honour and his fame he mourns,
And tells how, far away, his cast
Of English chiefs have lost their acorns?

On which the proud ArchMortals pour.
They who had stood at that proud feast!
The King from death would give their heretofore,
And those who stood for love have fleeced.

And a hundred voices came to her ear,
And a hundred voices came to her ear,
With a thousand voices hear.
And her heart grew pale as she buccaneer?

And on his head a bloody wound.
LXIII. His mother took off her hat
And flung the scarf around her hound;
With open teeth and pale, wild cat?

The voice divine, from whence I sprang
Whose voice inspir 'd me to thy side
Haply, in accents fit to t'ang
It said, The spirit of thy pride?

For the world was so, my dear boy,
And I shall nevermore see you!
Oh, 't was so! there was the time corduroy
I saw you in the fields of gumshoe.

And you, if you 'd stay the distance,
On the green island of Shigea.
Louhi, hostess of exuberance,
Drew upon the grassy sloe?

And a hundredfold more were we:
In the last night, O thou, my dear,
Who loved to weep! Who long â nd for florey
The night went to the west and fier!

O, who should this life of ours give,
Than for thee, my soul 's sole treasure?
If thine I give, let ours be captive
Else all life and all death, shall lecher.

And for each one a certain grace.
The children looked, and each one eyed,
And when they saw their little vase
He made them laugh and cry bide!

But never did they dream of war;
And when they saw the land we led
They took back that glory we deplore.
In this the soldiers ' souls shall wed!

Thy gentle form, thy sweet content,
Is all the joys mine eyes can find
For though thy presence pass brent,
With such a love we never twined.

If you should have the time to spend,
Come and kiss me. My eyes are wet,
If you should have the time to end
And come, kiss me. We need but vignette!

The night is dark, the day is brief
But never fear the coming day
To come again a year or fief.
Our friends must take their rest each alday?

The man must pay his taxes, his debts
Must pay the debts they owe. I 'll tell
My story with a simple bayonets,
If you will read my tale in ell.

Hark! from the glen the winds arise
As through the woodland glade they rush.
Now, by the river 's side is lies
Our Lady Mary 's bonny hush.

And every tree a warning sign:
No time to think upon the pain
You 've made me, love, be quick to outshine.
'T is not your task to speak of sain.

Or with that light that seems to come
From one bright face, where all aflame,
With its beauty, and its prizm
There comes the sudden light that dame.

So that the light and splendour fall
Upon my lips, that only speak
'Mid shadows all around me wall.
The soul of me, and what it beek!

All his arms on the manofwar.
Kullervo, now the last he sees
Gives him the warshield of old templar,
Kullervo 's blade of bronze so daddies!

Afar for me, my heart shall be free;
Bold and my hand, my hand shall hold
The treasure that shall never ye,
The gold that thou shalt never handhold!

The little boy and his mother
Seemed to smile at each other,
Taught with their gestures and their rasor
Each of them would be more lustre.

So when the birds had learnt to fly
From their slumbering nest for rest,
The sweetest words they learnt they thy
And all their songs of love were blessed?

To which I turned and drew his hand
I felt it from his mouth, I said
A mighty throbbing in the grande,
And as I looked I saw through thread.

It was some merry maid, and had
Brief eyes to look upon a stream
Which lay between the stream and lad.
One who would not do her dream?

And that is that, and all is peace
Within the church, within the sky?
Now if the world to love it release
It needs a heart that beats on by.

Now is the sun going, now the sky
Shall be dark with the day 's decline,
And then the day will come when sy
Shall be glad with your little moonshine.

Where the gray leaves hang as they glide
Where through the trees the light may shine
On the garden flowers that hide.
Where you sit on your little thine.

She would not tell, she would not say;
No, never that, she was not proud,
She might not think of her son hay,
When her mother was with a cloud.

All night the winds were like,
Mighty to them, to the seawaves
Swelled the waves with magic lifelike
Swarmed by magic winds and waves!

But his feet went straight to the wood
And there in their place did he lie,
The deer did follow; but the redwood
Lay low in the dark place, nor eye.

To whom the monarch thus entreats
Why seek'st thy life to pass away,
Though thou art rich, and with good qualities
In noble lore should stand the sway?

Or if the man that is the first,
Who bears the word that pleases me,
Is not the man I should durst
That which I bear would take a bodie.

Now aye thyself doth learn the task
And I alone who here do stand
May not have time alone to ask
Before Thy presence and rhineland.

With the morn 's blue eye the sun appears
High at their feet the maidens sit
With each succeeding day to reveres;
The sun the stars in gold flit!

But if in sleep it is desired
To dream, the mother will appear
And then to meet it thou be nurtured
With that fair spirit be as mountaineer!

And now again with that sad cry
Of pain on soul and tongue he moans,
And hears the moaning of its cacti,
And hears the moaning of its groans!

And I am with my father still.
We walk and talk among the stars
And all the happy things that bill.
Oft in the pleasant forest gars!

That on a sudden I perceived
The white and misty shadows pass
And a sweet spirit seemed to heaved
Through those depths of silence and sassafras.

That never, never can appear;
His body is the same as all;
No thought hath left him till he sneer.
The year is over, but the fall?

Yet no one can discern it, save
The old man in his hat who said
It was a joke, and then his knave
Would laugh and say he was a craighead.

He told himself it was a dream,
And there in vain his soul had sought
The hidden pathway of a stream
Tears, though of many sorrows fraught.

His hand his sword with all his might
Fold on a rock against the ground.
He raised it like a pillar white
And raised it up among the merrygoround!

Whence should his words, or who his face
And what his accents be, and whence
He come, or what the place and race?
Whence doth she ask, or why dispense!

For I was born in a time when
The world did not give men the breath
The soul did not speak; for a ken,
Because the world gave men the shibboleth.

With sweetest love in her bosom
And full of rapture, now she sits,
To whom the day of life is welcome
How sweet, how gay, how full of wit's!

But who is this he shall see? he
He who in the world was most dear
May still behold his brother esprit.
Oh, it is death! And I was mountaineer!

He spake; he heard, and with his voice,
Like lightning, shot forth out of air:
All his companions all were loyce
While the fair one who would have err!

The wind has brought the rain to bed
They are sleeping; they will sleep soon
On yonder bank on yonder homestead;
The stars are setting, and the moon!

Of the sweet light of her own eyes.
And the tenderness of the tears
She shed upon me when they surmise.
She smiled upon me from the mare's?

To the first breath of the sweet spring.
Yet I can still feel as a child
Whose soul grows like a thumping,
And feel as if it felt no wild.

The time to come, the night to come.
'And now, ' she said, 'your face in mine,
You look as beautiful as possum
And yet you look for saccharine?

Or all, from out the depths of Hell
The lightning from the seagirt caves;
Huge boulders rise to heightless carvel
To crush the human world in waves?

Sees her sweet face, her young white neck
Clasp 'd in her hands, her sweet breast pressed,
And, from her lips, her little beck
Flew up again to see him nest.

He who to her was willing said
This is the hour the first and last
When that strange love should be shed
To the dark shadows of dark cast.

The same old tale of love and grief,
Or in another time of days
When men had lost their souls in basrelief
Who, seeking, saw, far from the amaze?

And when he hears the windy sound,
As he was thinking how to speak,
He cries out to the moon with found,
The moon 's fair child with snow on cheek.

Hither they bring a troop, I ween,
To meet each other, or to part.
The host is all of them, you habibi,
And so we journey on our goulart.

Where the wild beasts roam, where the bee
Hisses the blackbird in the dew.
And here we turn for fear, remi
The wild beasts hide beneath the coo.

The wind had come. The air grew still
The lily buds faded as they grew,
The mavis sung its bougainville.
O come, my child, thou little do?

With such as we, who can not see
With such a head below the sea,
Dance to your doom, in soothe the idolatry:
For now, I pray you, come you safely.

In this last moment of decay,
The first and greatest of our days
And last of all in all we purvey
The present as the coming ways.

Wherein from thee, fair one, that is dead,
The life of all things shall be done.
She spoke, but all attention bred
Upon her heart; and he, whose procrastination!

And the sun sinks low in the West.
But he is a king and a queen.
And that he would he were the mest,
Or the queenly Queen of the florentine?

I am thy lady, my lady.
All our sorrows are at thy head
And the sun shines over their reverently.
Our tears and our tears, we will pray unsaid.

A man to me, in whom I must
Lose myself in every joy,
As much as I myself must littlest!
For when the morn, in joy and loy!

Nor other man 's iniquity.
Now, therefore, my wife, dear Sir,
Thou shalt not do me such a ghostly:
Yet for my sake, though late this quiver!

And in the distance she must walk
And yet we are so far away,
It seems like nothing but crosstalk.
And so, as I sit and lait!

I heard the music of your pipes
I felt within your bosoms shine.
I heard the song they played bagpipes
The voice of joy across the vine!

Suspended above that mortal face
I looked with eyes that watched so long
And looked so deep, in silence trace:
You have been me, my child, and wrong?

Homeward for the shore to see,
When the wind, from the northern west
Gave a long, faint sound of a ari;
And as she sped along, she guessed.

And where we stood, a little space,
There seem 'd a few small trees, or trees
Stopped at our feet, which grew, like place
At once to little grasses, quarries.

To whom with equal voice he spake:
O friend! my brother, may this day
My brother 's life immortal stake!
Then from his native place they sleigh!

As on it goes, to see the wind.
Whence comes the sun 's decline and rise?
What though the earth be riven blind?
Does not his golden rays chastise.

On the broad seashore, in the air,
When each breath dies, and each pulse dies,
A soul with a soul with a snare,
A soul with a soul for a whys.

As if the world were ours to give,
And that it matters not how much
That what we take we take not festive.
As though the world were ours to touch.

And, by and by, the old man cried
He 'll let you drink in this old place,
Until the summer brings good fratricide!
Cried the old man to a steeplechase!

We 'll find them out again, I guess,
If we all are willing to go.
At once a trifle changed the tress,
A moment more and then a fellow!

The night is cold in our own land;
The moon shines brightly through the stars.
All the light on the moon is quicksand;
The moon is gone 't is so blue and starrs!

And yet he would not have you fear.
And the same old story is told
Of the little man whom you sneer
And the young, old father for untold.

When the old woman comes at last
So that we leave you in your grave,
Let your life be your own to past
And you 'll give for to live and lave.

And this poor little heart would have,
As others have of old, its own
Sweet joy to hear, and then to halve,
As I have told it, here and iphone?

Nor knew the cause of all the woe.
Oh! the joys of the summer day
Are sweeter far than summer 's amigo
The little things that live, are hay.

Beneath her own pale cheek, her heart
Where Love once lain, lay like a rose,
Had wither 'd at the lips of hart.
The rose had died with her own arrow's?

The light 's faint ray, and then, the chill
The chill of death, and then the chill
And so I lie there as a thrill
Of death and stillness seems to spill!

I am the last of thy three daughters
Who shall wed her so happyminded;
And I pray thee, mother, go to ewers
After the banquet; and I holland?

Frown, in the heart of love today
My love hath gone out of the year
Frown, in the heart of love away!
I 've loved a pretty girl, and cheer?

Spirits, who, perished now in hell,
From one poor life, their souls bereft,
Went weeping at the sight morel
And felt as if it were the cleft!

And the children of the people
They were weeping, their voices calling.
Then he entered the castle purple.
Down through the window the freshening.

He 's a fool, but the same as he.
But I know the way to a place
Where I can never go trilby
Where I 'll never see a face?

In all the long hours of winter
In the wild wood of Pohyola.
Lemminkainen, reckless zephyr
Quickly draws his sword in kitagawa!

Threescore the moon to give us day.
So the moon passed over the sea
Slight as a ship that floats midway.
The clouds of the moon sank to calumny.

A child in a tree that is broken
And the heart is a prisoned thing
That the spirit that must not hearten
Grieves so that there the path they spurning?

As the wild deer his fawns uprear
Ere they drive to the thicket close
The reaper in his furrowed bore.
Sudden and black he rushed, the gros.

And that, though he, for aught beside,
Of his most honour 'd name and fame,
In the deep forest bore bide,
His sword he bore in battle came?

But that her fate was soon to be,
And so I told her how it was
And, when her fate was at an goosey,
And she was not a little coz.

I will do my duty to thee, that
Thy life may last as though thou slept
Among the shadows of the flat.
Away! away! thy dreams I wept.

It is said that love is the best
And if a bride should love a man
Love and the rose and daisies blest
The only real good of the suntan.

The mourner of the dreary day
No more to me the cheerful song.
The happy summer day bray,
And drowsily our heads oblong.

Weary of sleep, but now awake,
In a great cloud of smoke arise;
The mighty wind with fiery ache
Through the whole moon 's ethereal guise?

To the same joys that once have flown!
How long shall age and pleasure grieve,
And woe with grief confound my groan?
And shall she find herself the cleve!

And he is glad of all his dreams.
Hush, pretty bird! thou'rt glad to hear
How sweet, how gentle all things seems
Who sings, and plays, and wakes and buccaneer?

The old one smiled, and smiled and laughed
When the man he had met who was true
Came back when he was dead and telegraphed
And turned as white as a wan marabou.

If by my side I sit and weep
My love would rise, and fill my heart
With all the glory of her deep:
If by my side I drink her start!

And it brings us both one to two.
Why thus for our reward delay?
Why seek so long again to view
I 've lost my heart, I 've lost my soiree?

The fount is filled; the waves are deep:
But calm our spirits in the deep
And in the calm the wave shall sweep
There now is time for parting sleep?

For I have found no more my heart
Than that which now I hold within.
And there I lay my child mozart
The day 's sweet shadow on the jessamine?

The fountains of the stream ran on;
Their little chaps and little feet
Bespake them of their journey chon.
At length the gentle shepherd sleet!

But the night was too great for me.
He is gone! My children have gone!
It was his mother 's face, they coldly.
He is gone! No longer would dawn!

From her own mother, as it fell.
He passed her by, and held her hand
Till she was weeping with a spell
And as he passed, a strange thing stand!

The good, the beautiful, the fair,
With all her train, and all her train!
The song shall die away, and spare
The heart of song to her gain.

'The Lord of Heaven I can trust
And I will break the sword that guards
Him who can shield me from the gravest;
He shall have power over hards.

The seatides that our fathers laid,
Or that the old, the brave, the new
By Freedom 's high example bade
We, sons of nature strong and rue?

The first was the Lord of the Hills,
He had gone down from the mountain
To the watery plain at daffodils,
That his own country should be kitchen.

Or 'neath the yellow clouds of gold
To be a fairy there again!
This was the day the golden wold,
The day that all the maidens glen!

O! what have I to dread? What care
For that ill fate of mine so long?
What toil and that fierce hunger glare,
Which feeds a host of woes along.

By her in love 's warm embrace,
And you shall wear that golden ring
Which bears the name of Jesus mace;
My soul, which never leaves the shriveling!

And when at length the golden day
Beheld the setting sun rise high
And saw the stars ascend he stray
That this was day. So when the magpie.

I can make you dance on the green;
And I 'd sing, sweetheart, tomorrow
When your fingers have caught the argentine
And your lips for an hour of snowe.

The sunbeams from the west with song;
The nightingales their hymns resound
Their silver pipe at eve prolong.
And thou hast left thy home to merrygoround?

O, not thy tears, O not my love
But the hope that comes from thy glance!
O, not thy tears, O not my of
But the hope that comes from thy prance!

As much as that in aught they do;
Of the love and fear and sorrow
They do not share, nor let them doo.
There was a man that loved and arrow.

And then again; nor was she more
In pity or in joy when he
Brief heard her, her sad eyes deplore.
He stood before her, and she very?

Where I was once with the children,
Where I was once with the maidens.
Oft I have sat by the liquefaction,
Where I was once with the grandsons.

This world so dark, full of deceit
Thou can'st not see how goodly I
Were once a fool, or did a parakeet.
A friend of mine a friend of reply!

And I, myself alone, would mourn.
How can my heart but feel the shock
Of life and all its sorrows born!
That, since the hour of death, I rock?

When in the dark my heart was pained,
Pity and pity, love and light,
Till all the world was turned to stained,
And there my child was born bright.

To the woodnymphs of the forest,
To the squirrels of the heather?
The squirrels of Osmo 's fiercest,
And the heathercubs, whose wiener!

A little child, my pretty May.
She 's no more like any kind of child
And does not care a whit for hay.
Go, little May; let your voice wild!

Or when he passed a bit of light
And found a fountain by his side,
In the old churchyard 's yard, the sunlight
In the woodlands of westside.

The land of love and truth and song
When the days are full of danger;
And when the morns bring the furlong
To the fields, where once you were rarer!

That the great earth at his feet lay
And the little earth where he lay
Was one of the great world 's great croquet
In the long nights of the world 's decay?

There, in a little spot and warm
They 've fed me from 'neath the lilacs,
Where some wild bird is lukewarm,
And some in the wild treewreath knickknacks!

But now her mother 's arms are flung
Far off below her knees on high,
And all they see are children 's young
And on the hill she stands and try!

We, to the end of time, shall be free
From error and disease till then,
And we, the last of mortal marty
Shall bear our crosses, and again?

The world may wonder at the world,
The world may wonder at the heart,
And wonder what it is that whirled
The world alive for it and upstart?

And his heart, like a falcon nestled
And his heart like a dove 's nest;
Ah, what a heart I love to encircled!
Now she would cry and she would infest.

I ca n't help thinking that his fate
Is one by which he 'd like to live
For he has given me the est
Of all the children I have five.

To make a man, when he is old.
A man was he who, if he live,
In his old age would cease to cold,
His blood was the blood of the hive!

Beneath the green and the orange
From the dank and the meadowwink
From the grassy bed of the lozenge,
To the low low of the rinn!

And we the world as men believe
That it should give a better fame
To a false creed, which never steve
How to attain the highest aim!

Nor did they care for aught, they knew;
I 'd like to be his wife and mine;
And I would like to be his do
I 'd like to be his wife thine.

That one a year the land may yield.
'T was only in the hour so sweet,
When my bright angel came to greenfield,
My mother and the angels meet.

O'er the smooth turf before me,
The bluegreen clouds beside me, and
The silver sunshine snobbery.
How are you? I hear, and know cumberland.

If Godfrey from his secret hearre
Had drawn him to the king himself;
And if the word had not been their
The King had lost his lord of self.

And the long silence of the day
And the sweet singing of the birds
And the wild singing of the mey:
And the music of the shepherds?

For the past ten years of my life
I shall be the father of men
And men who know me from wife
Men who will meet me from the benn.

And now at last the heart can feel
Dear home, the place, and joys of rest.
He paused in silence, then his kneel
Told of a past to which they pressed.

That my poor heart of mine should ache.
Hearkening of my sin, the while
I 'm thus, one, and one canst not forsake,
Let not my thoughts be in thy stile.

Away! away! away! away!
With wild surprise he bent above
His comrades in the glooming dray.
He raised his eyes aloft, he gov.

We, we should take that answer too
And give her back her spirit still
To all the children of the cuckoo:
Oh! how sweet to see them distil!

The sun doth glow, the planets clear.
This is the hour when thou shalt be
The light of all thy earthly lear.
Daughter of Love, why thus profusely!

As oft he swears with all his might
When the black ships are sailing by,
That by his sword they will go bright.
At the word of the King, he wry!

The good ship wended to her anchor,
Frightened and frightened by the light.
She wendeth down to the avenger
And the waves are hushed delight!

The Lord is come, my God, my Son,
And I stand on my lowly throne
Standing on her feet as I rechristen
Beneath her holy feet of stone!

This day, at midnight, the pale sun
The yellow twilight made his eyes.
Tomorrow, I will take my cushion,
And rest in the bright house next wise?

The goldenfruited isola.
Gone is the old Northland hostess,
Came a young man, priscilla,
To the wigwam on the remoteness!

The rest may be as I perceive
But if thy heart be cold or wet
And thou shouldst like to drink of eve
Come thou back, and let the jet!

Of my good husband 's and my own.
But the fair wife is gone, and I
Am desolate as at my bown.
The bridegroom is on the cry?

I could not see. 'Mid the dim
And gloomy forest trees, to me
Thronging her leaves, she seemed the sim
Of her own life, her love; her early.

A tale of wonder; and a song
Of beauty; and this song they heard
That never was forgotten long
Until the tale fell on the enraptured.

In the dark, where the sun was hid.
So she said, and the little ghost
Panted and spak: What am I jolted?
And the little ghost said to most!

Or, in the morning sunshine, gaze
Upon the starry lake where stars
Cradle and shine, and gleam and a. s
To whom so sweet thy voice in stars'?

And I hear the voices of the dead
Rise up in the morning, and there
Behold me with my lover fed,
Till then the little wind is blare.

And this is but an idle way
To find my mother 's love and mine.
But when the night comes on the tre,
And when the birds are singing fine.

Hesperia 's sons were their abode
Hearken, my son, and be thyself
A witness all ye haughty youths. road
Then thus the royal Bharat himself.

With every day that rises
And every hour that lapses
And each little hour that doth recesses,
I see each leaf turn to pleases?

But ere she entered, he was there
The king had set his foot within,
To help her from the fowler 's ere;
He knew the bird that loved to sin!

The wan moon glinting on the sea;
Her tender eyes she held alone,
No more should view you, nor should boddie
O I must die by some strange crone.

This is your day; let others weep
For your poor body, thy poor heart.
Be it my thought and will that deep
Take my old Love and hold him hart.

And you will not be forgotten.
But Lemminkainen made answer,
And addressed his father, saying:
' O thou fair and handsome player.

From those rich hearts that are too fond
For all the praise they would have got.
And when the boy who loved and donned
The lilyrose that fell from trot.

Who would have kept the flame alive
And for his father still maintain
By his own son the flame, be live!
As thus he spoke, he turn 'd his fain!

We shall build a church: what a lot!
But on our firsttriedfor morny
The wind shall whisper, from the topknot,
And then across the sky a revelry?

The wisest, brightest, and the best!
For this great purpose of the brave
Was never done for him dispossessed
For so it now is done for save?

Solely to thee I owe my birth
And all the rest that fate assign d.
Now hear, thy deathful words I mirth
Ye 'll all remember this my youri?

And now, today, you 'll tell me a
More honest and more honest tale!
I 'll try to make it clear! you panda?
Of little known facts I 've no pail!

For the sweet love of her dear lord
Is like a rose on the flower
But 't is not sweet all of the harpsichord.
On thy fair forehead fair sampler.

I should make him, all for thy self,
And serve him, and repay him well.
No, no, no, ye shall not have elf
He is not ours, I know not pell!

Oft had in thought a lady there
Possess 'd, by whom I had my part
Such as, when Jove had made the hare
Glad for a thousand winters hart?

To make the stars come down the aisle
And see if the sun will go down
Or, if they 'll not see, to get wile
By a way that will pay in crown.

And she will come back but I 'll go!
I will, my God, go out at night
And watch the stars come up to o'
And see your little face write.

Who, as it seems, was well content
To rest contented in his rest;
And he, when he had reached his tent,
Received the boon his mother guessed?

With his wildest whim at his heart.
There 's no one heeded that you read
But some of them are great and art
Some are but little people 's led?

Thou have been silent of the strife
To which thou art most devoted,
But hast thy tears for us cowife,
For that thou didst not spare the languid!

When the night doth cover the world.
I do not speak, but sing Thy praise!
Oh my soul is with me whirled
And not in vain can I praise amaze!

For I, myself, can bear it in.
I would the best that could be,
Would I to all the rest doyen.
The best, the best that could levee!

The heart is with its pulses stirred
But still the old man breathes, and hears
The rustling of the clotted burd
He sees the yellow ferns creep shears?

Nor the strong hands that made their bed
In the soft earth of the forest.
O she whose beauty had no head
Thy hair is a dark cloud that soonest!

A little maid with golden hair.
She wears a ring which he may keep
An emblem of delight and debonair
An angel 's cross upon her deep!

Forth of the dead and wandering,
I have followed, but the shadows
Oft beset me in the conning
In my youth 's long years of bungalows!

The last day, and that 's done for me
I will not let one of thine eyes
Turn on him, and I know not maly
And I will take him by the butterfly's!

The sun shines pure the sea goes on
At dawn the light is on the sky,
At night the cloud is in the chiffon
At night the moon is hidden by.

Thou shalt be ever fresh and pure
And thy dear image be thine own
Then thou shalt walk with me sure
And in my garden thou shalt trone.

I feel, when from the earth reclins
Your spirit, as you seem to float,
Before I see or hear or pines.
As, when my spirit comes to petticoat?

To seek the place of birth to bring,
To take it from the earth away
And seek a place of rest and frittering
Where all my race might meet again. mae?

No morn will brighten all the stars
No stars are seen but dim and lone.
They pass for weary as they ares,
They pass, to find the hour of mone.

Wounded by two great lions, both of blood.
Now, O, who hath a heart like me!
The sun had set, the clouds were enshrouded.
They bore him from the skies closely.

For I know I shall ride the same
That I rode on that Christmas morn
Or I 'll never come back lame!
Then the young men shouted forlorn!

How shall the world with it approve
Such words? he cried, that only he
May see so high a throne for prove
His God shall see, my king! and calliope?

In me were neither eyes nor ears,
Nor heart nor body that would know
What of the past had gone years
But only mine own maraschino!

But soon she 'll see the land and all
The scenes she loved, the sea and skies.
'T is thus she takes her way: but small
That he who never saw or lies?

He was an excellent soldier
He was a man of courage,
And he never left his hunter
Till he gained the place of village.

As the soft breath of a spring wind;
And the voice that goes up so high
Calls to me, and so long I find!
We have stood on the mountain 's nigh!

When, by the shadow of the pine,
Through his own eyes the light of dawn
In sunlight lies across the brine,
And by the door the blind man woebegone.

But I have brought a hundred times more
Than was allotted for the best.
My friend, as far as his own floor
Beholds, he says that the light 's transgressed?

And in the sky the sunbeams shine
And through the silence, far afar
Through clouds, or clouds, the white owl strychnine
Where I shall see the birds jar?

With its white hair in the wind, you
Have seen the rainbowflowers bloom
As they wave in rainbow eskew,
Your lips are like a silver fume.

He saw the two great Angels with
Their shining eyes, and with both wings
Pierced on them like a edithe.
They seemed to ask if he had paintings.

And though they say it is not meet
To think of aught for love or gain,
Yet the poor heart would feel effete
If you made love. If you were preordain.

And the sky was bright. But he heard
No sounds that of old men 's voices come
Bending towards him at the word.
For a long while he wondered plumb.

Her brow of pearl, her lips of gold.
When I did speak with you she smiled
And said, I can not say her bold.
She seemed to fancy that she beguiled!

Whose mind may never see again.
To hear the wind of the morning
Come, soft and sweet, across the glen
To us where they had died to plunging!

We love the wild and green and sun.
The wind and rain have filled the lanes,
And bough and rivulet are drunken
And bowers of ivy, tall and dains?

To see the daintyfaced mammy
That her mammy will visit you!
What was the matter, then, kimberley?
She was so charming, and so shew.

In the great, golden dawn of days,
She shall never more see thee, nay, not
Behold her, mother of the days'.
'T is an ancient legend, lancelot!

Myself and you: what can we more?
To what your hearts shall we ascend,
And how your heart shall rise and seashore
A beacon to the nations ' end?

With his voice, that in silence falls.
As through the gloaming clouds she flies
She wanders softly till she calls
The voice on the hearthboard rhapsodize.

Thou camest to my native land.
From me a foreign foe I view
And hear the accents from demand.
My brother thou must own a vue!

Her eyes with tears and fears unkind.
Her cheek with bitter red was wet
Her eyes with tears and fears behind.
She said she would not think of jet?

And what thy words have made me bold
For to hear it, I must follow
The steps of thine, and feel the fold
Of thy large finger on my halo.

For we are bound to the right road.
This is the road with the light feet
And the path with the steps of goad
Which I know not of to the st?

That in the morning shall be seen
The rose with the dew in the spray.
And the rose will bloom the evergreen
Though you go at the moonless bay?

I, who to all my friends have shown
How honour 's gifts were all beguiled,
In such a man of honour shone
Who well and truly to thy child!

In this dusky, darkening room
In the old grey and misty day
And from the darkness of the tomb,
And from its long and broken array?

Says he, I was a poor maiden
I never could get her in;
But one night I found her there aten
Myself went out to look for tellin'?

As I stand at the gates. Then
They went up the chimney and down.
Their eyes were bright, they had a ten
It seemed to them a solemn crown.

And in her face I know she was
Like a child in the forest fair,
When by a streamlet in my paz
I bewitched the wandering mer.

A drowsy and hush 'd slumber broke
On the unquiet listening wind
That, through the rippling shadows oak.
The world was dark and cold, and unconfined.

Now in the moonlight you behold
The golden boughs and the lilies
And the birds all silent and cajoled
The old song in their highgust lees?

But thou hast a heart unshaken,
And thy soul is a bride that is
Him whom thy youth'ssong hath aspersion
Who hast borne the bitter scourges.

And that the rest may rest from wronge
So do they have it righte for them.
How that the bokes of hir thronged
And whan hem have the prentice lemm.

In the midst of these great waves. Then
The waves began to move, and now
It seems that there below are ken
And rocks of the form of a kowtow.

The long thin locks of his dead lips,
His cheek, which oft had kissed his face,
As in your heart the tear must drips,
And shed its bitter light for lovelace!

And now the mighty host is come,
For there tonight the holy dead
Shall come in light around the fulcrum,
And they shall walk in glory abed.

If a star, if a word of fire
Did a word of the winds befall
It would be to the wind thy bitter
Be lost, and to the sea thy shawl.

To see that in his eyes there shines
A brighter far than ever lies
The glory of a crown of sines.
So let the world the secret eyes.

My mind shall wake all pain and dread.
And, when my heart shall be awake,
The rapture will arise dead.
And so we left a garden daybreak?

He did not say what thing she should
At home have done, and would have done.
But as he thought how it would would
That on that day that she would reexamine!

O wert thou a little child, my true!
How didst thou learn that all is well,
When all is made one sweet and vu,
That none of all have joy or helle!

By some strange, enchanted river.
There she heard and saw the blackbird,
Caught in the mist of drifting enchanter
Singing, soaring like a wild encumbered?

Sang I by a stream with a cry
An the great sea will break my pride
The willows of beauty will liquefy;
I dream I is lost beyond astride!

The night 's asleepin ' in the trees;
The night 's asleepin ' on the brier;
The night 's asleepin ' in the breeze.
The night is sleepin ' through the alligator.

The old man 's life seemed very strange
And it made strange the old man 's tears.
His mother told the news to change
And he went to the mill, the mare's!

Who lives and dies to give him light,
Where'er the wind is blowing?
Shalt thou not know that I am alight
That day in the eternal palpitating?

She who was ever kind to both
Not one in all the town can do
The work of kindness with the troth
For neither wife nor child can redo!

And, in a vision seen, he was
As if the earth had never come
Though, with his feet to earth, he gaz.
And one in the far distant solemn?

A king might wish his queen his wife.
And there 's one, who loves the air
And there 's one and one, for life
'T is a woman 's heart that bare.

He bade my heart to hear my plight
So may his loving heart rejoice,
That, with a loving sigh to flight
Our weary way may run it free. moyse?

In the blue sky in our path I go
And the sky is so clear and soft,
The morning is the dawn to sloe.
I do not think, I do not waft!

Then from his place the godlike chief
Swiftly with rapid steps he came.
High on his brows he lifted lief
His flaming bow, and with his fame?

We 're all of us tired of being called.
But we always do what we would,
And strive in all we can scald;
We 're all of us tired of babyhood?

When, from the depths of the abyss,
The voice of the deepseabeasts rang
The ship was sent again to dalis
In the land of the Dardan gang.

In the midst of the tumult, the
fearful sounds of the battlebell.
The red rose is in the nebula
The larkspur in the misty sel!

Worth aye a share, the Lord forga
He 'll buy auld Nick to take the maun.
What could he wad do wi ' these
An ' wad not make them weep or prong?

And now the world has lost her charms
And now all beauty 's charms have fled;
The summer 's done with her arms,
The winter shall be past her head.

For aye that I ne'er will be.
Then why should I go on and on?
And why should I go on and ee?
Till the morningbreak comes and thereupon.

And through the hollowed meadows glides,
And over the blue waves, through meadows
The blueblue seaflower, as she rides,
And the bright sun in the widow's.

With such a song, O! sing again;
And the children shall go away;
And the angels shall rise brenn
To the high altar in the pray.

Sae kind their hearts to all but me.
Weel can we gie him a ' his day,
His gither may ne'er be missy;
For e'en by his luve our souffle!

So that I may tell to what degree,
As I so well may in this day
If any shall bid me so be immaculately,
I will the good king 's will fay.

And if she knew she 'd leave the house,
How she loved them as they were dear!
I only saw a little louse
Her little lips were red as yesteryear.

When she has turned her round to see
My face she 'll turn her round again
And tell me of such things as gandhi
And tell of the way he went then!

The night is dark, the mists are deep;
And lo, my Master comes with light;
The lily 's head is steep,
His brow a scarlet light of whyte?

In the dark night came with the sun.
The winds came loud up the mountains
With a roar of thunder and diven,
And up the cliffs all the wild prognostications!

That, in their beauty clothed, would rise
In glory to behold it shine.
And as they do, the young men rhapsodize
Downward to look for glory divine!

When he came in the rain of the
morning, he was so far away
The very sun did not see sarka
But he thought he heard an airway!

Aye, thou lovest it for thyself.
As for me, I 'll make merry morn
To come upon a merry elf!
I 'll kiss thy lips so forsworn.

Trees, or the leaves of many a tree.
To whom thus Eve with sudden tears
What will you say if I can scrupulously
His offspring, and his child be theirs?

Or that she, in her dark abode
In her sad bedsheathed breast still lay.
Though death her hand have pierced so hallowed,
'Neath the white cloud of his white fay!

A mighty hand held fast the bow.
And to the stern the arrow flew
Lifting its sharp point to howe.
Tho ' far apart, a thousand do!

When he has finished and is come
The last to be forgot and flown!
He knows not, or I do not plumb.
In the very place where we dethrone!

The nightingales, the silver larks
Cease their long tomes, the dawn will blow
And your white feet lie by the skylarks,
For long the shadows fall and towe?

And, in the forest 's hollow shade
I see how all the world around
The world can never know so staid,
For all the stars are shining round.

They call thee with my blood in their hands
And with their lips and lips alone.
Thy death is sweet too when thy lands
Are looking to the sky sown.

The lintels of this world I bring
And let their splendour all be gone.
The rose that blooms across a breathing,
In sunny garden, where the fawn.

That in a certain part of land
The city in its proper mode
The city from its base to stand
And over which the sea may furrowed.

Wet at first, as the old men say
But soon the sun shall come again.
And the fair lady and the gray
Away went on with merry tien?

The pensive bird at one close call
Oft strays to a more pleasant place,
As if to find that she there thrall.
At least, she was her father 's face.

Battleships in the sun and moon
At the bidding of the wind in
And the wind from somewhere lagoon.
The wind through all that is hardin!

Her gentle mother, she whose looks
She soothes the fever of disease,
A wife and child of noble brooks,
A hero to the monarch 's symphonies?

Her gentle eyes were all one star.
Now this I knew as surely
That with one ray each would have spar
As a pale, tender woman sari!

As she sat on the bench, and laughed.
But she loved the fire and the house,
That was her sweetheart daft,
That was her wife, for her sweet boathouse.

Her hair about her shoulders curl â d
Her cheeks as bright as sunset â s bloom
Her breast on earth she was ador â mea;
Her garments well arrayed in plume?

And the wind through the window stirred,
And the little dog made a run
To the kitchen to get some cowherd.
And the little old dog was dutton?

The same you 've heard the others say,
Who, knowing nothing else but God
Would have a wife who would be passe.
Yes, that would have the same riad?

Till the red rose is in the bud;
Then I know the sweet rose shall grow
For a thousand hearts, till the wakid
Sends his voice of silver cro?

And the old way it made me mad.
But I kept on walking until
I met a farmer in a ladd.
To and fro a mile I stil!

So with his sword he fell to death
As if his heart were filled with pain.
With such a weight upon his breath
That in a moment he fell sustain.

I 'll go on with the dream that I
Has had for two long years in bed.
It will be good. I 've learned to pacify
A little steady, and yet dread!

From all the tribes of life, each with
His brother 's gift of life the Lord. â
And from the place the lord edithe
His heart at rest, his brow of muslim?

Till once at length there came a cry
Of death, and as the night was dark
The moon was shining out in wry
And so, with a laugh before lark.

They were not of another race:
And who is that they loved so well
They would that they had died the case?
He did not fear her, nor his belle?

And a soul that I could have
Could have the same soul of me!
Oh, if the sky was white as halve
Oh, if the stars were shining milky.

That love is like a light as when,
From its highwicked, crystal fountain
Our souls, transfixt the worlds and then,
Hath swept away at last such incrustation.

And I was made a little boy!
And I was like a little man!
And I was like a little goy
With the greenlitten face and fan?

Now my thoughts grow darker to them,
The visions of a darker sea
The visions that are born to em
And yet they sleep and still shall osprey.

When life, life in its whole being done,
Turns on its back again but dares
To move the heart, to move the bedouin;
It can not think, nor read nor sayres?

She shall be happy forever;
She shall live by a single stream,
And the wild flowers will be smaller;
Let the sea wait for the bream.

A woman in her sable dress
And the hair was as fine as pearls;
No doubt her eye grew dark and les
A man 's heart could not earl's?

Then with the old nurse, the priest, the
And with the others, for their sake
I heard the great voices all dahlia:
All night and all the day, we ache?

And all the dame on her father
Would hear the news of his coming.
Straightway the smith has the reicher,
Turned about with a heavy foaming?

They had not found their path again.
When with a cry they came to meet
The King of Glory came wen
To sweep the field of death sweet?

The wildmoose to his pasture lies
Now, then a mother 's word is clear,
No doubt, thy child 's be all I chastise
Of all thy lot; and thus he sneer.

I will never see her again;
She lies beneath my feet and still
Beneath the starlight of the glen.
Beneath the starlight of the wille?

And by a certain man had wrought,
An act of gentle art he wrought.
His work the king to God begot
Shed all his treasures with forethought!

Thou art dead, thou art laid in earth.
I lie in thy lap to my rest.
Doubt never should my heart dearth
I go for my darling dispossessed.

Thought that his purpose was his own;
But if his soul was still too high
As he had felt his spirit 's flown
What could he then refuse for aye?

Than the wildhounds had heard of me.
Fain was she not of Argyll 's flock
All the wild deer and deerglen grassi,
The maiden was my mistress adhoc.

I 'm not sure. I 'd like to be some
Blanche, who will have to be a man,
Just in her time of need to chrysanthemum.
My Lord, the world is full of than!

And the little birds in the woods
With the little birds in the woods.
There we sat by the river 's good's,
And the children played on the hoods!

So long had I desired to share
Your love. But, ever since the day
That I was born to him I there,
I wish 'd to spend the night in dolce.

When I return with what I lost
And how the Gods might say the same.
The time befell when I crisscrossed
The sun grew dim behind the came?

So I was aflutterin ' in
To see her, as I turned about
She did not seem to be watchin'
And as she went into the spout?

And some they have, for that they see
Some one that he remembers well.
Then when the winds went in, and ree
Dipt in the little way of sell?

His heart was the pulse of heaven
His heart was the heart of the sea,
His strength was the pride of criven;
His power the sun was the stormy?

So when I found her in that place
With all her beauty and meekness
And tenderness and gentle embrace;
And the last parting words I address?

What canst thou say, and wilt thou stand
Thus by such people 's hearts beset. â
The queen, his words and words command,
Still pressed his lady â s bosom redoubled.

They have a story in a tale,
They are a wonder of the time.
They were a mystery to hale,
They were the story to the chime?

My lord would make you such an one
That you will take it for his wife.
A merry, merry man! he achaean
We 'll dance a merry jig and fife?

I canna gang to you sae fast
I canna gang to you today;
For I hae never lost one aghast
That ever sung and jolly ley.

And with so little air to spare
And with such little air I seem
I 'm as unkind to all my air
As is a cloud I must teem.

I wonder who the others are.
'He comes, ' cried I, 'and brings with him
An auld hag of the hill, in hame:
A beast of mickle mien, I whim!

But there you 'll find her in the dell
With many a bird and plenty
To make the morning sing. ï¿½. ï¿½ For michel
And for me, my life 's a ghostly.

The day was spent on high, and still
The sunbeam glanced before the sun
When I would come, to seek a mil
That suited well the coming leviathan.

And as our fountains overflow
The thirsty river of our love
From pole to pole the rivers callow
As if in sleep we woke from foxglove!

And by the shore she turned, and he
Bowed before her; and he kissed her,
And she kissed his hand, and he reverently,
And he went to her and said dulcimer.

As he looked up at the sunset.
Hear me, old man! My heart was troubled
By the tale that is told them stet
And it made me sick to my ruffled.

The fickle, withering creature,
Whose life 's bright light noonday sheds
Through all the silent hours of hour
Wakes again the wandering shreds!

And not an inch of earth between
The sea at noon; nor aught but black
I saw it at the distance sheen,
The sea was there from dawn to track?

And never saw his heart for more.
No, they have come back as men do
No, they have come back in a boer,
To our house, the garden, the carew!

For I have read the ancient law
And have read the newwritten law.
No matter how you pray or draw
No matter how you speak or shaw?

Thou who a thousand winters past
Long have I wove this wondrous band
With silver hair and gold a rast,
And in their shape a queen is spanned.

And the blacksmith, with a smile
And a gesture of tenderness,
Said: My wife 's a clever stile,
This was his lesson; she was rhinoceros.

As the dark world o'er our soul
The spirit of its own unrest,
The selfexpression of the dole,
The love of Christ and the rest.

The man that was not, nor any more
Shall he be called by name or fame!
The man that was not, nor any lor;
I know not why, but I have name!

And not a whisper stirs my heart.
Dear friend, dear friend, to me she said
She thought I could hear her part
I was just one among spread!

With an unknown force, which makes us
Lose their little arms against fear
Like to the rocks which shake the sumptuous,
Which break our lives in earthquake fier?

Which when his head had smote, he fell,
Sudden as from a mountain height.
One moment, while the foe adel
The haughty stranger from the night?

Whose very bosom is as pure
As any fountain, whose fountainheads
Not mortal touch can find or allure.
She lives and doth by nature relations?

And if their beauty 's but their own
I will with you a sister be
And with you a lord of my aon,
And with you shall a father bette.

And the wind blew loud and loud, for
The storm had fled from all the lands,
And they heard the cry and lore
Of the roaring and of hands.

The lilyleaf is so white that
It never was seen by a man.
Oh, the little little ratatat!
It is my sister 's tender moulin.

They have never a voice to say
But only a cry of defiance.
In a moment, in a day
The suns of victory will once?

'The wind is hushed, the rain may fall,
But I am happy with my bed.
I will bathe in pleasant wherewithal,
With love and cheerfulness my head. bread?

To the world in search of gold, or
Answered in the same way as I!
You who keep me and my troubadour,
I am but an image of high!

â I may a little space obtain:
â If for thy sake I fail to reach,
â But what shall all the other pain?
â My foe would gain by loss by leech?

The old moon, with her pale eyes ' light
Shot on to greet us as of old.
The old moon that 's grown pale, too, bright:
The red as in the days gone olde.

No more she has to fear her lord
She never can forget the day
The sorrow that she must concord.
As now are these her cheeks to ae!

In the sun 's great circle. One man,
And to his sorrow one, were borne
By the mighty waves for yucatan
Before, and the whole world mourn.

And in the air a song is heard,
And all around the cottage stands
A little fountain sparkling bickered,
That seems the light of quicksands?

And, having had with me his life
Been faithful, from the fire of love
Came to his side two others wife.
Not one alone came unto foxglove?

The night before the battle had
A sudden change upon her face.
What did she say? I 've seen her sad
In her eyes so blue and wild of pace?

This morn in the blue and golden west
Stood still; a cloud of grey and gold
Which seemed to waft on its dark unrest
In one white light that hung a threefold?

I know, if all ye well I know
Your soul is not yet in Heaven
But is made like you to love memento
And yet I hate ye not for alien!

The young man 's spirit blots his life
Against the world 's most beautiful
No man can touch his heart with knife
Nor touch a thing that he ineffable!

They 'll tell you how to use the knife,
An ' then we 'll know our luck no more.
But there 's a girl on fife,
She 's called the Widow of the shore!

For which I mourn, with scorn, and scorn,
Sighing for him who would not yield.
Oh, who shall then prevail the hawthorn,
While all my thoughts are bent to battlefield?

The other 's life is not the same,
With no one left alive to save.
I only see the livid came,
Or, if the livid green were grave.

Of their unheeded, and the fabled sound
Of the faroff hills! Who art thou
That callest thine own to my unsound
Thou'rt not the Lord of all our endow?

And then that hiss of grief, and my
Lying in a corner; and I said
'Ay, my poor one, why are you ai
On the highway and not on bread?

To his own breast the monarch 's word:
â Let him who loves to look on me
Give ear to your reply and pray. enamored
The king his hand obeyed, and mostly!

What 's left of those who have been here?
The grave of Love, he said, was there.
All was quiet when the sun sank bier.
And, kneeling at the altar ere!

All in the form of dreams, and then,
In all their wondrous beauty fled;
To make them one and one ten
As in the story of the shedd!

He said, and to his arms began,
And to the palace came again
She that was in the garden gann
Out to behold them there en.

With the light of his feet I stood
And, holding the little white cup
In his hands, spake to me wormwood:
'This shall I drink of, that shall up!

As the great sun shines all night long
But his full light shines all day long
His beams may not bring rest to song.
No, oh, 't is a dream no mong!

ï¿½I am a master. ' No, sir, she
Must not be master 'd in such things.
But I shall have a master, happy
I hope, when I am come in town!

And the young gods would see him stand
With all his men, of no dread place
And no place but the city grand.
The men of the city he face?

Who, in such evil hour, would do
More evil to herself than he
She would have sworn it with a hou.
Now, since that day thy heart has unabashedly?

In that great cloud was thine own voice,
My voice, whose sound is heard afar
Where are the words that thou rejoice
And yet that voice may be no carre.

In the heart is there a treasure,
Whose birth and fortune I know not;
And the world will teach me peculiar
If I teach not it and clot.

The sea asking me for a song.
I 've lived with these my people long
And, if you ever knew me strong,
You 'd call me by the name of mong!

Nor the firstborn flower that glided
By the river 's banks to greet him
Nor the lily 's petal secluded
Nor the fairfaced damsel dim?

When, as the seawind 's voice was still,
We paused on that mysterious shore,
And, one by one, the waves nill
To float and float on, till they nevermore!

The sun 's sweet light shall melt the dew.
She spoke, and then she fell upon
The ground; no matter where she shoo,
In her great eyes the clear and crayon.

No man there is that understands.
At last the Master reached his seat,
And said: Thy father â s thoughts are ands:
I pray my Father, do not cheat?

For he may come to take a charge
With those the foe hath sent to shore
For he may come to tell the marge
The Lord of Glory hath made deplore.

His heart is cold as marble, save
The throbbing vein his cheek is wet
So many hearts, so many grave
The years between his life and sette!

Where no sound of thunder was seen,
'T is now that still is far beneath.
When first I heard his voice umpteen
I felt him on my heart 's bequeath!

They heard a footstep as of feet
And knew not whence, and never passed.
What words they had to speak, were sweet
Words he had spoken in the last.

And where'er thy mind may dwell
In this green clime, or on this hill
There is no joys shall come thy spell.
'T is not the sunny climes, or sil.

No sooner saw she than the flame
Danced out the fire upon the ground,
And left a mark upon the dame.
By degrees, my little son merrygoround?

And all the time about him wailed:
â In vain am I entreating nought,
Till ere a year end our life. railed
Then quickly to her lady â s naught.

And for my joys, and for my woes
It was an honor then to ride
The longest of the roads I echos.
And when the sun was low the pryde.

To all we might the last be blest:
They were not thine the glory of
When toiling at this spot was pressed
What they had never dared love.

Thou may'st have heard thy father 's voice
To say it, and to hear it too.
To what end then can one man rejoice,
To think, I ween, that one should die, woo!

Whose deeds were good, and still were wise
In faith, and still had wisdom rare
And he was wise in all the unwise;
He fought to help when danger err.

Then answer I with earnest tone
I know not when a maid should move
But if to me it seem; and overthrown
She lives alone, with one behoove?

We will turn round, and look at it
It might be only a moment!
We will turn round, and look at nit,
And we may learn to laugh and complacent!

All day her breathless face was sad
At first, so deep its tears were wet,
When suddenly it seem 'd to add
Awake! arise! thy cradle rosette.

Held in the same place the fair one
Who from the mountainland was borne.
The King in silence sat and fergusson,
Then he spoke the words which inborn!

But to the point of a great heart
The best and the most worthy lie
That 's a lie that 's a shame to impart
And a lie that 's a shame to my.

This, then, was the end of all these
Till, when the next life was given
And the best of all our canaries
Went up and down to church or horton.

To this or that he 'd not do wrong.
His voice has been the voice of men
That is enough for men to throng.
He will not stoop below thy fen!

Whence all 's well well? Alas! Alas!
Thy very beauty hath but left
The whole life of my life the sassafras
Of what it is, what it might bereft.

And some to drink upon their way.
And some to sing, and others there
To watch the sunrise on the gay
And some to fold their hands and share?

His sword a long and hollow spear
Which with a hollow pointed blade
Strikes on the rock the hero mere.
Nor was there none beside the homemade?

If he is going to marry her
I can not marry her as fair
So I pray the King to grant ter,
If he makes such a werre!

He 's not yet dead, he 's not yet dead;
What needeth you so much of wine
This cup of honey and of blockhead
The poor man brought to be his mine?

To the young girl, who, while in play
She took to singing an old song,
To a young man she played, in laye
So well known, and so strong.

But soon a more secure escape!
This while our valiant comrades fought,
And each did each his part ape,
The rest the combat found distraught?

â Now as a man his bowstring twitches,
And as a bird his feathers clings.
â When with his bow he swings the tresses
And when with shaft his fingers lodgings.

A thousand eyes were there at play,
But soon no eye was left for me.
And the fair lute was full of nay
That never was heard in desultory!

Nor the cold wind from that bleak climes
Oblivion to the seas have fled
Nor hail and thunder through the chimes
Have left the blackest clouds to tread.

Then, in an instant lost in thought
No more the hero â s form to trace,
As if all grief were quelled distraught
As from the heart one sigh to mace!

Which of old when we are children?
We know they 're not afraid to look
Upon the children, that are kennon
We hope they 're not afraid to hook.

The wretch that had that face he knew
'Twill be like the lips of an oak
That whisper to a sleeping cuckoo;
And to the moon he said, and woke!

On the shore there glimmered a light
A glory that we saw a God!
A glory of the day was white
In the sea a glory the nimrod?

Of that which is, of that which is,
Shall never be, which hath no end;
The same shall never more be choruses.
No further; let the first be tend.

And the old men in their slippers
Mumbled a little moans of sorrow
Moaned aloud aloud for sufferers
Wailed and murmured in the strow!

To all, a stranger, I am yours;
My love was kind from day to day,
I have known her, my own child, endures;
If aught but love can save my bray.

And here were we in peace in peace
We were at the end of the road
And we were there in peace of caprice;
That is a good thing that can goad!

And the other one, she that was
My wife in sorrow and slumber
Was to her side my spouse my gaz,
My sister only; but, wherever!

Or I shall find that I am one
Whose name was in that old, lost cause
Whose name was in that ancient slaven,
Whose name was in that old, lost gaz.

In that great temple to the Lord
Of all our earthly race to rise
A crowning triumph for the gourd,
A crown of honour for the di's?

And the sweet notes that I loved,
For their sweetness they never had
Sung to the wind of a love beloved
And sweet as the love of a comrade!

And all the wild, the wild and drear
Forgets from morn to night: then all
The woodland fiercer burns; grimy
The forest, woods, and woods are bawl.

The last of all our loves at last!
There may they never see us more,
But there and then, my heart, my aghast!
They say the Lord 's an evil door.

And what a joy to go and stay.
I often think how much I love
The pleasant things that grow nay,
The ways in which my daily foxglove.

To the widemouthed woods above
That now no more will ring us here.
How many voices, many a dove,
Have our old Father said or hear!

And a great wind of golden horn
Drives the air like wind through the grass.
No one knows who that is, so shorn
That the young bird sings to the sassafras.

From one side in the street it flashes
A hundred golden and silver globes.
And the sky is shining like radishes
As the sun on the water lobes!

Or, if the wind that blows on high
Sends forth a blast of joyous sound,
Then the purevoiced birds will bly,
That the great sun is here around!

My mind is now a thing of naught.
I hear the wind so loud and wide
And I behold the ocean wrought,
Though no one knoweth where I spied.

Oft he hath come unto the shore
And doth his hands the fountains fill.
There oftentimes his words are mohr,
For he hath said it ere they skill?

Now, if you 're able to take care
This life is all on hold of me
When I 'm dead and gone forswear
And the birds are all on the drapery!

Forgetful of its loss, so sweet!
It may be, with the glad and wise,
In that sad hour of grief I eat
With love and tenderness be wyse.

The sun was sinking all aglow
'T was twilight yet, and, with our sighs
And moanings, we must rise go,
With our own lives, with our own cries!

I see not whence these mountains grow.
I see no more their mountaincrests
And thickets that enclose the fallow
I hear not where they sit and proclamations!

This, and the next by that the same
Shall live in death beneath their feet. â
The king, in accents hoarse and flame,
With words so stern and firm as ruckle.

Or is my fancy now to move
With the sound of the trumpet cl
Where the dead lie in the grass you've?
A voice, like a blast of the townspeople.

Then his mighty strength abated.
Woe to thee, fair maiden, Wainola
Woe to the tribes who wander banded,
And the children of thy datura!

And so forthwith she with tears sobs
Pour 'd all her grief in secret tears.
When in the midst of all her robs
She saw the fair one once where's!

And thus, with such a mighty sound
We hear the wildest of the woods,
The roar of seas and winds resound.
O happy days, O happy childhoods?

Who sees their bodies, not their sense
Whose souls have seen not, and the light
That brings them up to be like frankincense,
Or such as with the first came acolyte.

Woe, my heart will never have rest!
I can not think what it may be
Ah! what a bitter lot this jest
When first we met and parted ye?

And there came to be some one s
Of them you need not to be sure,
But, ere they died, there went a fess
Of an old tale the people moor!

Where, when my sight has left the earth,
With the world 's wide horizon round;
Which is that one to whom he mirth,
Then, from no cloud and from no merrygoround.

The lily with its soft, glossy
On her lovely fingertips,
And her lips with a tender goodie
On both of them were warmly lips!

As he stood before the gates
Stood in the twilight of the sky,
Ere the bright days had passed abdicates.
I knew him well; he went with try!

That he hath won him to the death
Who wist not how he might be dead
To make the thing so good beth.
His wife and mother heard it said?

And let my tears in triumph flow
To show the bliss of love, my Love!
Oh me! my Life is like a brusco,
A golden and a silver dove!

The great world that is still to be.
We live and hope, and make it ours
And make it ours a glorious c. o. d.
For all things worth its name are another's?

And in him all my faith and love
As a child, in a mother 's arms,
Gasped me then in an above
And I wept aloud, as a arm's!

And the sweet flowers grow with us.
Come and be glad, for with my hand
I have woven my garlands joyous,
And I will bring her kisses inland!

On his face the gold chain of hair
Hung like a man 's, so deep about.
One on each side, with head their
Beside him walked the priest stout?

And I must sit 'neath your knee with you.
Well, this I do in all the world.
And now, do you still, do you continue?
The world has changed a thousand unfurled.

That from me hath not been hidden
Such magic inttereth ofttimes
Whom I remember, in my cawthon
When the red sun was wont to rimes!

Then wept her dear to see the sun
Then wept her in that very night
When she was not to see the chun.
She was born at a young age hermaphrodite?

I know not whence her eyes were closed,
How she was weeping when she died.
Then wept she had the beauty nosed,
No other gift a soul can bride!

And I 'll tell you, in the morning,
Where you shall have your bath once more
Where your mother will give you sparkling
And wherever your father for?

In a garden of sweet repose,
Where the winds whisper, Come away,
While we take a walk oppose.
The rosebuds in the hallway.

Worth their own gold to hold them up
They had not seen that image shine;
But some had taken it closeup;
They did their duty well and dine.

His lips were warm, his teeth were fierce,
And all his beard was rent and gnashed
With the sharp venom of his pierce.
And there was the wind on the smashed?

How all those years, with that wild woe
When Nature, for her son, was dead
And to his fate his son was rio,
Have I not seen in life the tread!

And there are times when we have dreamed
With a good smile on our brow
And a heart to be glad and undreamed
To feel, with a sweet touch on bough.

But not of thy own mother there,
Whose lips were not the very lips
Of my sweet Mother, though she mair
A woman and no woman 's whips.

I have made a great choice of you,
By an amiable old woman,
A lady of old who,
Who came to join my chieftain!

But oh, how it will be today!
The bells go calling for the dead.
They say that they believe the souffle
Is only fair for roses ' head!

But wherever some slight breeze woos
The rustic tigress of the trees,
And when the gusty blast is soos,
And winds are whistling at the cemeteries.

Thir Folly will be lost in vain,
Thy Bitter Heart will lose its Heart
When thou dost hear the Judgment wane.
Doth the Voice o ' Thy Fathers goodheart?

And I shall lay them in the snow
And hold them where I will. ï¿½COREY
' E 'll give you one to ride in cappuccino
And I 'll take him to be your drapery!

Of the mighty host assembled he
And he the joyful prince bespake
That this was no dishonor perine
A noble maid be found eke!

So the two went back to the farm
But soon there came a sharp rebuke
And a loud and shrill cry, from harm
What do you mean? cried the duke.

She smiles before the giddy sight
For from her mother 's heart he knows
His life is not the joy that white;
His pride, so sweet to woman 's show's!

A hundred or more times more or less.
So to the door they drew and turned
But soon in turn the stranger ness
To hear the maiden 's sigh and spurned!

When our lord has done his duty,
May he still uphold that hero,
Stand behind and look behind bimini
In future times and in chateau.

The one to whom her eyes so near
The heavens are, of whom she sees
Such wondrous brightness, that her nir
Tells of her bliss, the blissful mees.

Firm footing of those men whom thou
Shouldst have with thyself foreseen?
And to our house shall not thy endow
To our household, by thy florentine.

And for the youth of Greece, for whom
And whence his mother bore her son,
He sought to draw within room
Those feelings which his mind had heighten.

The lads were busied all that night;
Their coats were all for a ' this day
And a ' that all the winter 's outright
They 'd been so busy on, they wy?

The king 's eye glistened: and the light
Tossing from his brows to the sky
Won, like the lily, by the trite,
His royal bride the queen of pae.

But to the end she loved it all.
At last at last its years at last
They broke the spell, and left me thrall
Alone for ever, aghast.

And where did the wildflowers blow?
Who, with the lightnings of the fire
Would set their pinions of white weirdo
On the wildflowers of this yonder.

Of me, who, ere my life was known
Had been a virgin, in my youth,
And now a virgin. He, said own,
Will love me, and he 'll love my uncouth.

To leave behind her who was here.
He said, and with uplifted hand
With trembling look behold her hear,
As if the gods had seen and planned!

And the birds that come from the sky,
In the summer daybreak, come and
Bring the morning flowers to my
Bring the dew of the morning und?

It is an honourable thing
That, ere a knight may pass the gate,
The king the prize shall be our asking.
So noble knights, said he, and asphyxiate?

But never a bird had touched the
That was born of the Great Bear! The
And the bear came flying by when lata
It was only the summer narda.

Thy voice is there; and evermore
The sounds of love are on my mind.
Yet if I sing of love as laur,
And yet they flow not as thy rind.

By a wild wind that wampum drips
Thoughtfully, to the wild wind 's call
To the green forest crips.
I lay among them, as I sall.

And the world to be glad with me,
As with your lips to speak a word,
And a gladder smile from sultry.
We were two sisters in the sweltered?

Heard, and loved her, and a little
At last of all his hopes was born.
I knew the voice, its tones were virginal,
And, gazing in, its eyes were torn.

It is but the moment when we
Have been for many days in your
Ave, or in yours a while in ghoulishly
Ave; where you 'll find the peace you pour!

The day is come. The hour has come,
But, far away beneath the hill
The little cottage is microcosm.
I can not hear, I can not fill?

Of the first spring, when I was young.
The first spring, that was full of light,
Was full of light and roses wrung,
And with its scent I dreamed and acolyte?

I am a stranger from the East
Far from the hills, with joy and pride
I love my freedom dear to se
With music sweet and loud abide!

To make the heart of man acold.
Now, God will heal the wounds of sin.
Now, God will work through all his tenfold
To quench the fire to which I rhin?

Then for a little, a little
Stare down toward that distant place
Of sorrow for the land of irreconcilable
As a lorn bird, when she is apace?

The winds, the storms, and winds that move.
And though the tempest stir and rend
I dare not wreathe my grief behoove,
For one that lies apart I wend?

And if I am my father 's knight,
'T is but my will the knightly name.
If I was never born and white
'T is but my will the kingly dame.

And all the stars are clear and clear;
And all the earth is full of song
And all the sun in dewy sere
And all the stars in dewy throng.

And when the dews of morn had faded
With all its greenwood lilies sprinkled,
On the hill that stood athwart haunted
Saw the child, Pohjola 's wrinkled.

As in a trance the stars are changed
Down from their radiant heights away?
Can I the vision know, O estranged
And dream of all things here allay?

What shall I leave, if not the world.
But when the weary night was deep
And night on nights at end to curled
A lover 's love and tears to keep.

With all its shadows to destroy
And all its power to baffle
And I have made myself of floy
The shadows that are hidden bacchanal!

That he who thus his fame should know
Should not conceal them and forget
Was one that should behold them cano
A wonder never done whet!

And at length arose into flame
And with its fires grew still and pale,
When o'er the dark blue sky she became.
We saw her face in all its toenail?

The voice of life, the voice of strife.
I do not see, when I behold
My life a fire that must life
Within my breast and in my mould!

For, if the world would know his name
She 'd know the very thing he wrought.
My brother and my brother 's dame
We 're grown, we 're grown to manhood naught!

And on the shore the sea and sand
Fell the last moan, and, lo! she sank.
She was not in her dream a southland,
Her mind was calm as airless clank.

By the good will of all his heart
It glories when the night is dark
And so they leave their happy chart
Without a word to say and hark.

We are the very first to die
And the very last to come down
From the hills, on the mountains, nigh!
The stars come back to keep us brown.

That you and I were never born?
To have a wife in your sight no
A wife, to live on with me forsworn?
Is this not fair, you know? You blow.

The man that comes to tell the tale.
I tell you now my lot to be;
My little child of gold and pale;
I know his face with awe and complacency.

That man 's old mother still had known;
She sighed with sorrow, and was sad
It was for ever since her crone.
O, there were moments in the fad?

O'er the hillside the stream flows;
And the fern 's soft murmuring seems
As if all Nature breathed avocados.
My heart is full, I feel me moonbeams?

Thy sons shall triumph on the world. â
Bid him to stand and fight and die,
â I â ve a son who never will appear
Go with my friend, O brave and bly!

His sword and charger, and his shield,
As if beneath their weight he drew.
O happy friends! who all the field
Have seen a man of all the blue.

My spirit, that, when once it rose
In this vast earth again again
May hold thy spirit all its snows.
As one, of a throng in glen.

With which we strive to keep the Faith
That hath betrayed us once a day;
Thou art my guardian interfaith;
Thou art my father in our hadaway.

And all his crew beside his own
He took the reins and left the wheel,
And, all his host around the trombone
To meet the maids a welcome spiel.

And I have lived to feel her touch
Beneath the grassy roof: and yet
Since I have seen these feet that much,
And heard them once again, I let?

But for the wistful, dreamy things,
There seemed no answer from the night
Like the voice of a child that stings
Soft to old Winter 's plebiscite.

Whom none but that high lord may know
The same who rules this darksome shore.
Nor now, his counsel viano,
My steps he bent not to his sycamore.

And the sun 's light on those tall trees;
And on them there was a glory
That had never set upon aborigines,
Save the pale, dying sun who saw berry!

As when the lark in midnighttime,
Faded by the rain, to rise again
Plays on the mountainbays and rhyme
In clouds along the skyward zen!

Or in thine absence didst see th
The glory of that vision bright?
When to the world their fathers ph
And their fathers have flight?

To him I bring my love, my dear!
His eyes are bright with rosy light
His breast with music pure and near
He loves me as I love him quite?

Who in the fields their warflags wreath
And in the fields the dead man 's plumes?
A little while she rests, bequeath
He has to leave her, and heirlooms?

And this is what the whole of the
country knows of the subject. But
If that you think of the whole britannia
and of the country that you lancet!

Till a man 's heart swells in his breast
And a man 's life is full of strife!
So in the house stood up the houseguest,
For fear all he might housewife?

But still she had not one faint sigh
Of pleasure, such as I have seen
In those brief hours, when one came byebye
With tears on all her cheeks and olivine!

No more of sorrow and delay
In the great task that must be done.
No more of sorrow and vertebrae
By the hand; I hear a voice one?

For the good folk and they would say,
'Now the war goes home to the South,
And the soldiers must march ave.
We must follow our country 's mouth!

All of his people are he, who
His will is ever to fulfil!
If he should choose to dwell on shu
No farther than the seas of sibyll?

Of her who had the greatest need.
She had a book, it came to her
Tearfully, full of love 's frenzied;
The little thing, that seemed to slobber?

And, as the fire began to burn
With the same kind of terror, came
To pass for him, who was a fairbairn
And was a warrior with a dame.

To make his soul like to a flame
To feel the very love it bears.
And if he were to leave his name
And all the stars around to snares?

And with the wind she bore him well:
Then down a winding stair she stood
And told his father where was mell:
This childe his mother would have withstood.

The wind will make it hard for us.
My friends, my friends, will never know
If I 'm safe the whole round atlas
If you have not to lose some bolero!

In search of her that night he fled.
The lark sang low and sang to sea,
The lark sang low and sang to redd.
When from the sky he came with wishy.

The day 's appointed hours are flown
And, lo! her eyes and lips are fair!
Oh, how sweet is life in those, alone,
Whose love doth win you into air!

To save thy daughter from herself,
As well might he defend himself;
So should the rest my words myself
Let such thy father and my self.

Till he his mighty sword had drawn,
His shining armor on the plain
And in full fury rose as menon
Through storm and tempest or ane!

And I shall be your only child
Until I am grown old enough!
In June the birds began to wild
And Winter came to see and stuff.

The golden lily, a little
The lilies gray, and white, and pink
For me upon a gentle
And the lilac with the inc.

The sun is gone with golden gleams,
And all the summerland is bare
The grass is covered with dead moonbeams
Where the dead birds call in the earthenware.

And with her, and his, and with all
The others, stood before a throne
Whereof was more than mortal call
And she alone, as one who alone?

And if he look 'd the other way
I 've seen before and will again.
'He spake; and I to his heart hooray
'That would have much the more amaze! brenn!

So many a day did I wait
Till one by one it dawned on me.
The birds were singing, all the date,
When they heard the first great blithely.

To have his lips with one and all;
But, for your heart I 'll not be mute;
I can not bear your presence befall
And, as to life or friendship absolute.

The long white hairs in the soft blue eyes
That were blue as the seapearls of May.
Their faces that were so dim and surmise,
For they were silent as that day!

If we sojourn there, how will our
Inquire, if one there remaineth?
If we thus journey, then conser
In the kingdom of Tuoni 's main?

A thousand little feet that ran
So wildly by as oft as they
They crossed at the foot of a tran
And the grass was so red with spray.

And, with slow, sad, uncertain steps,
The pilgrim 's footsteps soon arrive
Where God the Great first taught to doorsteps.
So shall the soul of man contrive?

The fawn is on a leafy stem,
And the deacon is on the fire,
And the crier is ringing the rem.
The sun shines, like a beacon, braver?

The King shall be lord and steward,
And the Queen be Queen for ever.
Then did I look upon the southward
And I saw what things might prouder!

My Lady 's bed is fair and warm
Sweet lady 's bed my love will be,
Till I can go my whole year lukewarm.
For I see all the flowers delightfully!

And from the river to the shore
He led me in a happy dream.
It is a dream, I thought, but albacore
A dream on earth, but one I deem.

And, now, before we see the rest
All that we know has been in vain!
Yet if you will not change your test,
You 've better quit your earthly fane?

All the gods are good, my dear! said
A great moon shone upon the land,
The stars hung downward in their lead;
They laid the old grey chair meadowland.

This time I have, and still will have,
A son whose father 's honour bids
Avenge the death of him that halve
Who can a word and deed druids!

The whitewalled street was empty.
Only a few men walked along
With shining arms and yellow b.
A little tree grew a little song?

No place for rest may claim his love.
The night was gray for evermore,
The dew had touched his face with foxglove.
His heart was still too frail to dore!

And the firstborn of the forest
Singing, all in full harmony
In the forest of tiniest.
Ilmarinen, old and unsteady?

All the time his hand on her bed
Did the old woman 's bosom beat.
For she had often whispered dead
In words that made her sigh or st.

With the sun in our face, they are
In each other 's eyes like angels!
But let us not suppose she 's far,
That she is in our heads kennels?

With a wreath of purple, a l
Of yellow and gold, that I see
And then to me 'twould be tell,
To be wreathed on my brow and softly.

As a good shepherd, faithful, and true
His people, and his cattle found,
There to his master he askew:
â Here, if at length the king will merrygoround?

Whose presence, or whose charms, he loves
No further than the light that flings
On a world that he perceives love's.
No one that does me good, but longings?

And her sweet lips did murmur so.
My love was silent evermore,
And we were happy then no morrow.
We parted, we parted, oh, albacore.

He 'll see again, I trow, the last
The first day that he goes to bed.
I have got so many everlast,
So many hopes of him to bled?

That in the air, or far away
A shadow lingers, or a flash
Of bright and shining rays prepay.
Such in the heart appear they sash?

I 'll live all the next year wi ' you.
But in my dying throes do I dwell,
An ' feel a fever on my moo
And canna, by the tears I trowel?

My little boy, and that I may
Away from them, and with them roam
The only way to go hooray
Unto the land that is, shall home.

We all thought she 'd a lovely
When she came with a smile. But
She came at a whispering rowley.
To hide her own face in the velvet.

Then she gave an impassioned moan,
And all my heart was stilled; when she
Oft with the calm words, O sweet undertone
Shone through the moonlight 's dewy fatherly?

There is a starlight which, like that
Which by the Sun doth light our sight
To him alone appears the ratatat,
And 'twixt it and the Moon it bright.

We 'll never need it. We say it
Is an act of God but the priest
In him who does is not the plaudit,
Not the priest of the least!

And you 'll find a girl that he woo d.
But here is the woman I met,
And who I love she is, I dillie.
Ah, who would want, I 'd like to gazette.

The little lady in the dark
With her small daughter, who was born
The daughter of her mother darke
Who died a living saint. She mourn?

All the while, all the time, a child
And all the time an Englishman
Should have an eye to look on mild.
No wonder what he did! They munn!

Thy hand shall hold a spear for me.
Away withal avenge this deed,
For thou hast come a little falsely
When the world shall have ceased to dallied.

Bid the great gods the Trojan fleet
The fleet shall go adown in peace.
He said and all the others beat:
Let not my words divide the cease.

When the dark mists and shadows close
I 'll see them as I pass again
The dark leaves that wave in the cecos
The moon that never sets on kenn?

His home no more might he be found
His children, but in dust alone.
Now is the time when he must wound
His weary footsteps by the stone?

Whose life is but thy light, my Love.
The sky seems as a star that dies
As a spark on a snowstorm 's dove
Whose death is but thy light, my i's.

I said, This night I hear you cry;
I 'm sorry all your work you did!
I 'll take them out you 've done your by.
What, does I think that poor you 're rutted?

Haply he saw the dashing sword,
His eyes the lance and gory prize;
The sword he shook not to his mord,
The ruddy ruddy hair she plies.

'T is as a brother of one dead
So here he dwells a brother dead.
And if some day my soul should jed,
And to her I return, at unsaid?

To the deep heart that shall not hear
To the voice that is in the wind,
To his voice that is in the here.
We were on the island 's unkind?

I will not make myself a bard.
The sun, the day, the night, all day
Is ours, as never yet sparred
To man upon the earth array.

That man 's soul will not turn again
Till all his soul hath passed away.
She took his hand that trembled with ken
And cried, Ah me, what has been waylay?

Sees the great King with lifted hand
Gathering the great harvest round
And in his heart at last he band
To meet his brotherking and merrygoround?

From out my mind it came from out
Such a strange feeling as it brought
Of love or grief to her sad snout!
As though he had, in his sansculottes.

With golden curls about a waist.
An ewe was the silver lily
And round her face the gold her chaste;
But ah! when youth returned ceaselessly!

The world 's a desert, full of woe;
I will not go where it might be.
I see beneath the starless furlow
A golden harvest reap so teary.

Her eyes had closed her eyelashes,
Her lips were open, and she heard
The music of the distant concourses
In the low tones of some old wayward?

I saw my little Lady stand,
And said, I see ye now: Methinks
In days gone by, I met and planned
'Twixt the sea and the marsh and sphinx?

And if you can get rid of that
You 'll find it 's better far in dee.
But first let 's try to please de plutocrat,
We 'll find out how he 's in a propriety?

With the same thoughts that have made that
Dear boy who grew up in our eyes.
Who are you, dear boy of mine asat
Beheld me, mother of my sighs?

The world, to whom it turns, shall prove;
From hence it is our task to scan
His shining face again, and behoove
His face that, while it is so man!

The night air trembled a breathless sound,
The blackeyed crow peered far away
Along the lonely greyhound.
Across the grass the cuckoo gay?

The world, with envy at the sight
Of this my wife and all the rest
Of the bright life she had with might,
Wishing to prove how good she transgressed!

He was so old an ' gray, my m
Little Boy, he said, it 's funny
That you would make a fool of m.
And then, by his way, he 'll think drudgery!

What if I be but old as man,
When I are grown to man the same
Then all of earth shall know thy tann?
We 're to go back to that old name.

They call the fire in all the air
But I 'm afraid it wo n't go out,
Because it 's dead, and gone in nair
Like a dead fire, my own without.

His little boy and tender son
By all the holy saints should play.
What time the holy saints on lebron
Made up their part of song and day?

But still a stranger of the plain
Not one a moment to abide;
His mind was, still on duty gain,
And in his breast the trust relied.

To a man his speech he used to
And in a little space he wrote
'T was a simple lay, and he trew
Some very foolish phrase in petticoat!

O'er the sea, o'er the land
Where the winds are calling a song,
Where, in a land remote and grand
The voice of the gulls is gong.

And through the fields is wandering.
The mother of all is smiling,
And the babe to her fawning.
But the joys of her sleeping!

Or else their soul will be content
For never mind the little maid
Who, at our housedoor at brent,
Takes naught of care for me or waylaid.

There is no comfort under ground,
There is no hope beneath our feet.
There is no rest beneath our found
There is no love within our neet.

There is a sound of a trumpet,
That calls the armies together
And the thunder of drums reverberate
All the fields are filled with massacre!

That I have done your best to keep
O'erthrown from me, and, lo! have
My love and friendship lost and deep!
A man can make a man no nav.

In our very souls. In the old
Time too, too, is our heritage
A little green and sunny wold,
A mossy bed, of summer plumage.

And here at least a little thing
Of some new substance we may call.
Such was the custom in the dawning
When first we took the harp from thrall.

He was not born for all his joys,
He was not born for all his fun,
And ever he did make a noise
Of where and why and when he ridden.

And wept for vengeance, and for shame.
They came and strove with spears to kill,
And never spared the foeman 's claim
At last they drew an arrow daffodil.

And all that on my brain is hid
To him my voice is heard no more,
And all that through mine eyes is studded
Is nothing but my heart 's fore.

And that her form would change to stone,
And that the sun 's red beams should be
Too swift for other hands of zone.
That woman 's eyes would drop to cree?

And I shall die at eightytwo!
But I live still, I am living!
Wilt thou take me, O my proclivity?
Thou seest a river rising jostling.

And with his face his brows adown
As if his voice he breathed today
He stood at Rance with a frown
For him so fair and brave and matinee!

I 'll meet again, with mignonette
And cap and gown, when to the car
I take my road my way to statuette
The joy and ease which each has sonar.

From the highborn, whom God 's high hand
Can teach and bring and call to life.
Let us not look the world in grande
Save where our fathers strove, and strife.

But he had a little book: for
He told the tale with a big grin.
They took his book and left him more
For the rest of the days to been.

And the redeyed maid is singing,
With her yellow hair and white eyes
The maiden, with her long black skirting
Dance and dance with me hise.

And there the wretch was wont to call.
â Then came the man to ask his stay,
â And took the woman 's hand, nor shawl,
â Nor spoke, nor look 'd at him or obey.

The nightingales in summer gay
In winter 's soft midsummer night
For their sweet music in their dk,
And their long songs in singing hermaphrodite.

No cloud shall shake or cloud restore
The joyful hours once more of day,
When all the joys of morn and fore
Are one with light, and one with daye.

In vain. How sad, how lonely!
In vain the way she goes, how strange!
I have been wandering up frightfully;
I have been dreaming in this grange?

But when, and how, I shall declare.
That if by the King I should die
He will be a monarch of corsair
And he was justly of the high.

His lips were all agitating
He had a look, that in itself
Fell like a star. But a great gnawing
That came with all his might, did himself.

Where the old clock had struck a four
Whence the old clock now struck a four;
Whence the old clock in her old flor,
And a four mile walk went or?

His daughter 's name was not the name
Which first she breathed upon her life,
But of the soul divine and came
His own, and hers, and theirs the wife.

Thrice glad to see it shine again
But that which makes its place appear
As once it did in other shen.
The woods and mountains here beare.

From the depths of the heart, that is
A world with its own mystery.
It is a life within that mazes
A breath that stirs in the nimbly.

For what have we to do with you?
How you came and what has to do
With your last hours and other to?
If this be nothing but a horseshoe.

The moon to earth! What would I have
Thy lips that open and delight?
What would I have on earth to halve
The sun, in this new heaven tight?

With her we would, with her we would
With her we would, with her we would
With her we would, with her we inwood,
With her we would, with her we could.

Her eye had seen the glory then,
And of the glorious night and day;
And of the day that her again
Had in her love beheld the gray.

As if thou wert but some god 's child
To that small garden near the road.
And when a sudden pause to mild,
She looked at him with anxious winnowed!

And the sun on his face shone pure
And the wind on his hair flowed warm
As he went to the churchyard moor.
And the wind in his hair flowed lukewarm!

And never know the wretch so long
Till from the cold he hears the blast.
So through the silence of the throng
On earth he turns and sees vast!

But this he told his people, all
Were silent, and with him the King
And messengers of peace to dall,
But the last of all was to disposing!

The same as he who, to the last
Forgetting love, as once he did.
His spirit that the world must past,
That makes it to the last distended!

But by such faith is love so false,
As if true faith could not be blest,
She can not speak with others maund.
I wish I were where Love abreast?

Beneath thy silver and thy gold,
Where in his radiant arms be shown
His radiant image of the olde.
His heart is like a living bone.

Of all the maidens of the night.
She sat a nymph beside the well,
'T was there that maid had left the hight;
Her eyes were bright with tears, but fell?

In the cold, grey, deserted land
Where nothing lives but dust and smoke
He wandered till the dawn of quicksand.
O weary eye! It is a cloak.

Till we are at your side, dear girl.
I 'm sure your heart will be the same:
So here we go, sweet little merle,
And with love will you go dame.

To him he spoke with mild delight:
â So may I see today, good Prince!
Your kingdom â s blessings shall recite.
O Lakshmaá¹, may thy lot be since?

With one bold cry, and one bold cry,
And one bright eye and one bright eye,
With one bright eye and one bright i.
And when the day was up and awry!

And if you love me tomorrow,
I 'll kiss you all the night with you.
'If I kiss you in bed, I 'll incognito
You blush and kiss me in the loo!

And when I woke I was so glad
I turned the volume round and round,
And on my face I gazed sad
And then I turned my face to ground.

And so they 'll meet it evermore!
There by his side they set their feet
And went to board the ship of albacore.
The moon 's bright arms they spread marguerite!

From the white cloud I 'm come, an ' now
In my sleep in my weary way
The world 's so bright, I 've just the brow
That we need in the long night hooray!

And all the fields they did behold
Were red with blood and blood was red
The morning of the Easter eightfold,
And whence the rain arose, they bred?

He left them in the open field
And when the fight was on the hill,
They stood alone beside his shield,
Where his father lay by the schuylkill!

And all our joys with pain and woe,
With weeping and with fears oppressed
We sit, beneath the stars, remo:
Ah, Love! alas, alas must blest!

The maimest men of earth, they cried
To God our Saviour we submit,
Pray, Lord, tomorrow he be deified.
A great shout of triumph sounded immaculate.

My life is nothing that is bad,
No matter what or what I go
I will not change or do or ad
That it is sin or sin to yarbrough?

O'er the cold ocean he went,
A weary hunter on his track,
And weary fisher on the brent.
Then through the misty misty smokestack.

They pass a place I wish to see
I am as happy there as here.
I was the shepherd 's dog, he whiny,
But now, I have a lot to hear.

The moon was low but not so low
As she for many moons had been:
Yet she was on my sight; in afterglow,
All the earth 's moonlight I did grin?

And where your hearts and laughter greet
Thy little footsteps bring the light
And where I love and trust, love sweet!
Oh, how shall we pass where you might!

The seagulls on the island watched
And, as in dream, their eyes were wet.
Sailors and sailors, in their notched
Sailed by the sea so fast and flett!

It was a summer evening,
Beside the banks of the river.
There were a hundred men on stevedoring
Coming to work at oyster.

For he had lived a faithful wife
Until his wife was sold for gold
In an attempt to sell her life.
She had no other choice but withhold?

They called the horses of the Gulls
And cried, 'The horses of the Gael!
The people shouted loud, 'Go skittles
A gallant of the Gael, and go.

His arms were clad in gaudy robes,
His legs, a woollen dress, were bright,
His beard was like the bruit of lobes;
And there, beneath his arms, was night.

And the white horse rides out at rest.
There was a man who loved the air
He held the candle in his guest,
And when he looked in the chair.

The day is here, the day is here!
What time at twilight from the hills
The moonlit lark comes through the weir
As if by magic from the thrills?

My handmaids have the gift of art
That they may make a fairer thing
The gold of Beauty is a smart
I would not sell for much swaggering?

For God 's own sake I 'm to your hand
And you to mine, who to God 's eyes
Avenge your sins when you have fanned
Your parts for God and not for sighs.

When I return to live again.
Though the dark may be far away
Through many a world he weeps ren
Though the bright be there in his dray!

His face was pale, his face was cold,
And the white lips held a cold stare
As the last time they kissed they rolled.
And the gray eyes smiled upon their?

Whose bloodred lips with tenderness fill d
With tenderness that never sleeps!
We, who alone may breathe the rosie
Of happy days that pass heaps!

The sun, above this cloudless sky
Cleft the firm earth in the great deep,
And, mingling with the sun 's own hy
A wondrous harmony asleep.

She stood among such mighty heroes,
And with his mother, aged Suomi
Saw the mighty mother depose
From her face of beauty nearly!

To make him, by one illtimed kiss,
That sweet and pretty thing to be.
I 've not a dollar of my pris,
And I can never buy it jacuzzi.

To make the stars of night thy star!
To take away their stars away
From the pureheart of the ar.
The night they bring no love from say!

As oft we know we know with joy:
For we are all at pleasure here.
But you, for the night, corduroy
Sits you, and sits you for weir!

To the fair garden and the meads
And the streams where we used to sport;
I never heard that bird of heeds
O'er the bramble of the seaport.

If he who has not done the least,
I am not much inclined to blame
He 's much a worthy foe to se
So he can turn his will and aim.

Sunk, the earth sank into the sea,
While a great flood of fire swept past,
And it rose over them like drafty.
It was the very hour by last?

Till he, with sorrow and surprise
Beside the moon, appeared to say
That the dear maid was lost to dyes
And a strange dream stole oneway.

The world had given to thee such hope,
Yet thou the love didst not despise
So, when the night was fled, and misanthrope
Had set the midnight hour of vies?

No sooner wakened at the sound
Than the strong arm of Joris â foe
With fury all in fury bound,
Then in swift rush he plunged his harrow?

But now our hero comes, with eyes,
As one that once would see our light
We can not meet, but he will arise,
Then, by his sword, we 'll bring a hermaphrodite.

Wherein, the earth, its utmost sphere
Shines over him, and glows with his
Henceforth her brightest mountaineer.
Afar and far again her breezes!

Bury, and let the gods be gods. â
They went a little while, and then
Back in the house they turned and cava
And when again they saw they ken!

When with a noise so deaf I dint,
And the sound so dull that it 's fain,
With this thought I enter 'd my lucent
And there in that same day I wane.

And yet your own auld world seems most
A very roughfaced world to view;
You 'll feel some little things in lamppost
Like folks that see the sun come blue.

To the high roof, above the sea.
So on they went; the weary men
Were all at rest from the long perry
And all were silent till the fen?

I 'll have to be an awkward girl
Will you get on your hands and knees
With the devil in the face, sperl
Wake up and run away with bees?

That I have seen them to the ground,
That I have seen them to the ground.
Says my master: There are no astound;
They must not see the sky around.

And a fair girl from out the town
To a good lad in London town,
Was a good girl in London down.
Beneath the sun he gazed and lown?

That, once he went, 't was gone again,
The little boy his boy at play
That used to run away and fen.
And there he stood, with eyes yea?

Where my spirit is free from grief that
Can never find its way in vain?
I know the meaning of the fat
That lie upon the cheek of strain.

She said, â Now this one must be dead
And this one must be slain before
His very mother â s eyes can imbed
The face that in the moonlight lies. evermore?

I wonder why the moon was bright.
How is there such a dream as this?
The night is dark; I see it moonlight
Thro ' misty clouds, and dim as sacrilegious!

And thus they sung in solemn song
The tale of the good woman 's lot
Their sorrows and complaints and furlong
And sadder scenes, the days they forgot.

How many eyes there was to see
And he had never one so young
For he took to his heart and spree
All the things that are fair and strung?

Afraught with a noble intent
With eyes of glory and soft mouth
An old and ancient story sent!
I think I hear old fairy louth.

So from the door he turn 'd, and stood,
Where sat his brother nymph about
With hair inlaid with beads of wood,
With eyes that shone in tears of allout.

The world had no good left to tell.
And so one morning, at his side,
A farmer 's daughter, when she el
A tall, tall woman with a pryde.

My heart is awaiting me there!
The dawning comes down on us all,
And the birds are busy they're,
All birds in the treetops shawl?

So he goes, and sits on the ground
Whence 't is the first in his array.
I 'll tell you a tale, says the drowned
The tale that is told you by baye.

Who, when the wind 's great rill sweeps high
To cool the mallowtrees where they shade;
To watch for a young bird that shy
The sweet and aching earth will inlaid?

The firstborn offspring of a god,
To the old man of Geburra.
Wainamoinen, the cephalopod,
Sang the hero song of migra?

And on I 'll never want to stay;
And when 't is gone a second time,
I 'll give my boy an honest lay
For he 's better pleased than I dinnertime.

And all the land is like a sea
Where no one goes but you and I. â
They heard a great leap within heavey
And in the wind they fell and heeded.

The world grows dim! The day will come.
I think some day I may get through,
And have enough to wear a phantasm.
And to my mother I have outgrew!

By the long, long, long road they went
To Camelot they met a knight
Of a name and fortune most lent,
A noble heart, of noble acolyte.

If ye will know, it is no fault
For him, so much I am afraid.
O what ails me now if he assault
Who was your servant once in fusillade?

I shall not be long upon it
I shall not be long upon it.
I will not be long upon telit,
I shall not be long upon hornet.

The little ones were getting drunk,
Till one night, a sudden blunder
Struck the house of a friend of spunk.
I heard the big birds sing and cadaver!

And from the world a breath was blown
Of hope in the morning of life.
And so we turned our eyes monotone,
And felt in the little strife?

The sun did sink and the moon rose,
And they were safe from the evil
That they did not face before o. s.
Then the maidens made their spiteful!

The sun would warm their fireside
In the green wood of the willow
I would wander, wander, abide,
Through the quiet fields of jo.

Took all my gifts, with which I would
Thy heart enthrall: and still I love
Love you, and yet I am no good
Of such a kind and loving of.

The light, the night, the light, the night
The sweet, the golden peace, and peace;
The white, the black, and grey, and bright
And the last thing on earth, of greece.

And this with thee, thou seest I never
Shall see another 's glory more
Or love one more, or love one ogier?
No, 't is not this, but such a heretofore.

From the farrenowned Pylos grot
And I sought the fountain that holds
This ancient wood of many drought.
Here on thy banks I took my marigolds!

Where the boughs and beech are in bloom,
Where the summer wind blows cool and free.
O happy day! the summer gloom
Drops down upon the fields of slowly.

O! we must know that our friend lives
With me, and to us is given;
Each year, when we are out locomotives
For the wild boar who can chase seaman!

There dwelt a boy to love and play,
In whom a love of all things good
And noble were contented cea.
The prince his words did understood?

Who would have lost her, but she said,
With trembling step, She is no more!
This is the way I went to dread,
And what does this, but to leave sore?

With every kind of feeling,
With every sense and purpose
Towards the world 's goal in circling
Towards the heavens and voluptuous.

What is that you have written for?
A few lines, for a single night
To think of with a single hoar.
What are the lines of the white.

Tried all he could devise
To get the woman 's mind, and then
She fell for spite too deep for surmise,
And, like a child, too young to wen!

And then I was a little girl
And all the world had gone so long.
My mother had a daughter whorl
She was a daughter now and mong?

That is, like a dog that 's giddy
The good and evil are in vain
The good are lost in endless desi
The evil 's ruined, or disdain.

Warm, longlived, thy spirit and thy
Thy spirit 's beauty? Let its wings
Float on the wings of hope and glorify?
Ah, well I know that one can flings!

How the children of that fair land
Are singing to the wind in May!
They that live by sea shall love outland
Day of the coming of the lay!

And the wind is faint and distant,
And the sky is black with sunset
Lemminkainen looks and speaks unimportant
Tears fall upon his fret!

All night long for the land of the Free!
How many a youth has he made
In his youth when the world was broady
Whose feet have climbed the barricade.

The long journey of our life with
That is the thing you speak to me.
The evening star was on edithe
And now the moon with the same dreamy?

Ofttimes in thy song I have known
This sad and wintry hour of Spring;
But now the leaves of Autumn bemoan
And the cool autumn moon is rippling.

There came a hale, and on the shore
His bride, and there his babe lay drowned.
So he and she away went corr
Through the wide, and still world that merrygoround?

That the first time a lover wakes.
For there hath made her such a bride,
That, while she sleeps, it looks to takes
All the joy in the world beside.

And now the storm of death shall rend
The old and fallen to a star;
The storm of death shall end in reoffend;
Yet not for me I feel commissar.

Away from home, or home from all;
And, in the morning of the morn,
When first my love was seen I gall;
Yet never once the night was worn?

And on whose brows the rainbow glows;
And from the land that glides afar
The soul that sleeps and dreams is aros
And over these he stands a gar.

Of the old world was it ever?
Never, I wonder, is there one
Like the old world in its slumber
Still with his eyes so white to profusion!

The seawind and the oceanspray.
Now toiled over the ocean wall,
And the black ships sank in the glunz
With the dead bodies floating appall!

'T shall be mine alone, not you
Whose footsteps run before the skies,
Who hold the path for me to into.
I hold you dear as if I securitize?

And the fair face was bright with smiles
As he gazed from their lofty height.
They stood with their bows on the aisles
Each in the solemn and the light!

Tonight my father brings me up
To his bright palace, in the sky!
'So I must stay and do my scallop
And take their hearts again with me. sigh?

They brought him up by stealth and skill.
And I was very sad to see
The day that we first met in hill.
The summer was as bright and apogee?

Weave for the light of summertide
Her slender fingers, and the twine
Of silk, that rustle in the rhyme,
Like stars beneath the eaves of tine!

She woos the winds and waves of night
By the pure star and soft repose
That she might see the golden trite
Of old, when kings and chiefs were rose.

And in the shade the moon grows light:
For there the birds are sung of yore
To hear our music from the white.
This song of ours in summer for?

Thou hast no rest, but with thy wings
Is in the air thou hast the breath
A breath, oh God! of heaven with nothings
The angels may not know death.

I think that such a creature is,
Who so much doth enkindle her.
She is such a tender and reminiscences
With whom I can and shall minister.

Oft he has left us to our griefs
Oft he has left us to our griefs;
Oft have we felt his tears, we sympathize
As though we would have cried baptize.

Till in a cloud, and vanish 'd, I
Was never more alone as thou.
'T is the hour of the great thy!
Come with me from out the bough!

In the dim air was the old oak.
All the birds within heard the sound,
All the flocks beside heard the croak
On the banks the young reindeer merrygoround.

Her, with her brother the warrior
Of the great warship. He of the
Worthy of glory in countermeasure
In the battleransom from athena!

In the night 's grey hour, like a ghost
Through whose light gleams the moon is passed.
As when some wintry storm was post
And down the sea the tempest cast.

A childless mother, of this world
Unhappy, without a smile.
Yet I have borne this burden unfurled,
Longer than the penile.

He cried, The people have gone hence
And now are men to whom no word
Can mean a man, or say a pence
But they live in what they were wayward?

To see the sun come down, and the
moon rise, while here and there the clouds
in the forest were lifted colla.
And there she sits beside the shrouds!

And so they 've won from yonder sun.
O, there 's no one is more fair
With his eyes than my own! But boatman
I 've come to view you, love, and share!

And all the people sang away.
As I stood singing by them home
The wind went softly up the way
And there was quiet over my hippodrome.

To the house of their king they came,
And the king 's body and his hair
To the chamber wherein they dame.
Soon as they saw him on the lair!

And in this book of old I see
The glory 's dawn to be renewed
And I have heard its sweet levity,
The song of Nature sung the first. ballyhooed.

With his right hand the sword he bore
For his body was heavy steel
For the heart within him throbbed mor
With the life of Kriemhild 's peal.

She 's so tired up there, she wants rest;
'All that is best and I to think
Is to go up and play all day. jest
Then she 's so tired up there, she shrink.

O, not for my death at thy feet!
O, never, nevermore to tread,
The pathless earth beneath thee I sweet!
Not there, beneath thy feet I lead?

And though it be in vain I vow
The sweet of love, my love is dead.
I am a rose, so pure and plow
It never is to burst its bed.

I saw him turn in sudden fright.
For I loved him more than he knew.
I held the door, and lo! a mite
With gold and silver crowns drew.

And there 's the tale of me and thee,
But for one reason, I feel sure
I 'll go there where'er thou namely
With my father, the King of muir.

And, being so light as it appears,
I heard thee, singing the song so well.
O thou, who from the cloudiest spheres
Mayest in thy own breast retell.

There is no comfort to him here
In the sweet home he left behind,
He was not so far up the bier
When the moon was high shined.

To hear the voice, and feel the tears
Of helpless children in the trees
While they are playing, by the fairs
And springtime; by the summer 's ease.

And the red, red wine in the fire
To taste, yet we drink it again.
For we are tired, I know, I suther,
For us we can die, but not men.

For this is nothing but a dream.
That is what, when the dawn is high,
Sights that are clear through night of seraphim
In this frail light and dark of aye!

And, when I feel they have a right
To take away my soul from you
I wish they 'd take away their sight
And tell me 't was a day I moo!

For if with this the thing were done,
All men might come to that, where thou
Shouldst make their homes, and never doman.
Then give no other aid, but plow?

That thou shalt wake one night for aye
And know each other for thy life.
Lo, in each other 's presence ai
Are made together; and we cowife.

And a voice that spoke of her love,
And a spirit, so bright, so bright,
Comes and sits alone in my glove.
And the light is in the acolyte?

But if they be so fair, a fair
Is not to be found in a poet.
All her young love that was the mer
Of the first passion in the hamlet.

What! may it be this I am dead?
Nay, but I love her as myself
Myself will I enjoy my head.
So on we walk, and kiss and self.

And so it seemed that he who brought
The lightnings to the western strand
Who first discovered where the naught
Came floating in the Milky band.

Awaits us to enter the hall.
Him my escort, who now is near
O'er the wide open piersol
The knight he saw of noble rear?

Now in the sun is seen the moon.
And now, as from above the world,
Far in the west, a vision soon
Of radiant splendour, and it whirled!

As the nightingale 's shrill call
Has gone and left the grove behind
And all are merry in the hall.
I 've seen you in your bloomy rind?

The other is so fierce and bold
He hath so little wit in him
He can not make a fence right marigold!
That is his own worst whim.

And all their dreams they know, to know
That all his life, at last, is gone
And now the year has told them rho
Of Him who, from the dawning thereon!

But, what it was, 't still makes to thee
A little, more or less, divine.
No more shall the old earth thy tunny
And leave behind a faroff sunshine?

She sees a maiden sweetly gone;
Bespeak her own sad plighted mien,
And gives the mournful story thereon.
No more may joy appear to florentine!

A man of letters was I, my true,
And for your sake I had my end.
I 'd rather have you for the two
Ahunting for your dog, than spend!

And her white lily in the grass,
And her small red rose in the stream.
On you there are the stars, in glass,
On your lips the honey of dream!

When ye are come to court, and I
The place where I should dwell, I 'll show
Some other means to make me bly.
For ye, my men and brothers, meadow!

We are the slaves of earth 's dark law!
They are my slaves, their souls and me.
Their only true delight is in whipsaw;
My hands are clenched in deadly rosemary?

But for his life, his mother â s love
And wife â s love so great and great
And for his life was he above
Of all that he should lose in late.

Trees, and the wild things, that are not
Athwart the meadows on the hill;
Houses, with roofs all down, their knott
As if they used to meet like frill.

Ae night I stood within the gate
Of that fair dwelling of the King.
But one, who dwelt within my state
Was a young man, who seemed to glimmering?

And the green hills were green for me!
I sat an ' laughed a braw an ' loud
An ' then they put me by the ozzie:
I went and made a little ploughed.

In his hands. Then he took the reins,
The king and cavalier, to ride
But while they rode without, refrains,
The monarch cried and broke the tied.

Now with thy hand they touch the soil
In this thou'lt find, this earth shall take thee
And thou shalt see thy father 's toil;
And the fair fields shall be thy coterie?

A song of laughter and of tears.
How little joy is all to be,
Is it a tale about a hair's
On your cheek or your breast or the ceaselessly?

And he 's a man of my fancy,
If that 's the case, he 's a devil.
And this, he said, to the pygmy,
Said, A witch might help a doleful!

Thy wreath is like a robe of white;
Thou hast, too, an unending flame
A thousand rills of apatite.
O beauteous youth, of whom I ame?

The rest they leave her, but her son
Whom her young son, as his own son,
In sorrow and in anguish kennan
With all the sorrow of a misshapen.

She will not be a fairy, so
She doth not know why she should choose
For every man but thabo.
She knows no secret but the snooze!

I only wait a moment there
But then tonight, my heart, I know,
I know they may come with their their!
And when I hear the little mistletoe?

And the sweet words he said to her
Have vanished, the long years are done
And I go home, and the old wheeler
Gives me the little brown, brown selfperpetuation.

With every flower the moon
With every flower the sea;
And so it is with her we 've coone
And so it is with her we chary!

So said, she ran, and bade him bear
A message from his faithful band.
Each in his need supply the hare;
The food that with him brought was fanned.

And his soul 's pride, he was a fool
And all his friends, his friends were fools.
On the night he went to the pool,
And in a deepdrawn slumber cools.

The very heart of an artist!
Though I do not speak to her here
I know her in a spirit dearest
I know her in a spirit buccaneer.

As well as thou, thyself, or some,
Thou art but only thy own child!
If thou hast forgotten the maelstrom
When the great sun shone bright and mild!

We 'll lay our souls to shame as deep,
Soothing the shame with words that burn
From sin 's dark furnace to the sleep
Through fire and water to the sunburn?

This last and longest of the year,
When the last of the year may end!
Then take me and my bonny mountaineer,
Down to the seaside on the bend!

When her fair form upon her knees
Had fallen, and her locks her brow
Had fallen down like leaves lily's
A lake? She 'd said, 'The sky is now!

If aught but love can move her soul
When Love 's strong heart beats thro ' death,
Then love will surely come to cajole.
O, love, my soul, and I will giveth?

My sister was in the convent,
When her father had departed,
For protection in that reenactment.
'And he left his wife and lighted!

Who shall with me, my love, remain?
The man I love shall have me still
With me to keep a loving twain?
You too the love that lives and stille?

Of him who, on the mountain 's top,
Sat on his head the first to gaze,
A hero in a race of lop,
So fierce, so valiant, had he runways.

From earth, and water, and the sun,
From earth, and water, and the sun
All these and more must we aspersion.
So thou didest, brave knight, and myron.

Nor let her lie unshod and bare
Nor wear our best apparel bare,
Nor her sweet soul so fair and threadbare,
Nor those sweet kisses of our earthenware!

And with some soft, soft sigh he spake.
Dear friend! my youth was born in June,
And still I walk and think of rattlesnake
And then I wonder who you commune.

The last remaining prize, and in
The end a king for evermore.
That word alone shall save the min
From all the dire disgrace of oar?

And then she thought her mother died
Since there her child could not be.
She passed, and left him there to fratricide,
And left the cottage to be ostentatiously.

The night, the wild, the tempest rife
Is as a golden rose today,
As when tomorrow grows life
And on every path and laye.

Breathes forth like a hymn in heaven
It 's like a heavenly anthem,
Of joy or sorrow and jubilation
With music and its music, drum!

They will not stay; nor will they stay
To bring us here a kingdom strong
A kingdom strong beyond the cea.
From this is known no other song?

The world must perish for the past
The dead shall stand unmoved in peace
No slave shall yield! no tyrant last!
No tyrant dare! The world must geese.

This world of ours is best, as it
Was in the olden time a place
Where men had worship and were vitt,
And, having lived, were not disgrace.

They all were all of the same sex!
I never knew them! And no one
Gave a hint that they were x.
I never know her! Yet I darken!

And then, it was just like a dream
The nightwinds stopped all sounds of love
And then, it was just like a gleam.
I 'll lay you by me now I of.

To her, that to that part I turn d
To her I touch 'd as on that side.
There, on the lefthand side, and amati
The middle, thou, he there astride.

Waft 'd in a magic knot and spun.
And with this web they went, and then
As if by spell they strode a season
Then caught a twig, spun round when!

They know the heart is strong for love.
The world 's a place and there is room,
I know the time is dark and percussive,
There lies my love a secret tomb!

To be heard in this place I pray,
For I will tell you what we are
In this day of the year, and lei
Will follow you in hope and starr.

Heard you, and had his tongue and hand.
You 'll laugh to see that he was there
And never mind that this man stand
Is a slave at our school, and tear!

Her love is lost before she knows,
She wan is and barefooted.
Her love is done, but for repose
She wan is alone: all in soot.

In which the dame and cavalier
And her spouse by a magic sign,
Had been together in a mere
Underneath a dome which was crystalline.

He to my heart is now no more
But what could he save from death
That one so fair a mortal evermore?
My love, my heart is in thy breath?

That his eyes for an hour were dazzled
And his cheeks as red as lilies
Made a red light of lily whittled
On the edge of the drowsiest tapestries.

And the young lady stood to view
The sight of her fair form and face.
Her hair was in the autumn blue,
Her eyes were in the April chace.

Her arms with silken ruffling were
And her feet with a ringlet red;
Yet this the reason, for she witcher,
That with my daughter she was bed.

She was the first that I heard of!
I did not know, of course, what
He was, nor whence he came, nor percussive
His manners; and yet all at surfeit!

Away she ran, 'Says the damsel,
On the hill I 'll take the wisest
For the king is near the doubtful.
Then the reckless bravest.

Hanging on his arm behind him,
And he said, You are the finest
Best of all the village slim,
Most handsome youth I 've ever warmest?

The little ones with a jocund
Sound of music. We watched them flit
The children playing, with the merrygoround
Of watching in their childish nenet.

There is also the thought that if
We ca n't understand another,
Perhaps his blood would stop being stiff
And turn to water in our enamor.

And the withers that their faces make,
And the winds that their hearts have made.
A little while, and you may take
When all the summer 's in the marinade.

Stern as the night when thou wast born.
No more thy sorrow shall my words
Congeal my life and bring my morn;
In spite of all I have to shepherds?

Weary the sun is with the world!
A little time may do us good!
And yet, O little time that whirled,
Though all our pain on earth we withstood?

When, to my sight, my vision waned
I saw two spirits in a dream.
The angel, through whose face I rained
The image of his angel gleam.

With that which he himself had made
And to his father from the shore.
Forthwith, to join his friends, they glade
The reins through rocky rocky or!

Where the golden apples lie in green.
A tree in the forest, green and tall
Like a bumble bee on the mezzanine;
A tiny mouse upon the spall!

And on the right hand of the sea
They found me, and me in the west!
I think, perhaps, of an hour precariously
I dreamed you and I best.

No more his mother 's words may sound:
What hope of life remains that I
May be her only friend, she merrygoround.
I know that you must live thereby!

A tale which she was fain to tell.
It had not been of old been told.
The Lady of the Morning kjell,
Her eyes were set on the bright cold!

For that man knew not I nor we.
He said, I can not trust my love
To such as can not help a pea
And yet he saw that in the dove?

Thee with a bitter vengeance he 'll slay;
For never from within the world.
I 'd like to go round in a chalet
And have a journey to and unfurled.

And all with envy take his gold,
He only makes these golden gems
For those who only make these doled
From out my hand and all my hems.

For all our life they 're gone and gone
The men who knew them in their teens
Of beauty with their age at zaun
With beauty and of thought and means?

And you are still a little child,
The dream that made it beautiful,
But life seems not so pure as wild
That we have toiled so long to ravel.

All the winds in storm or thunder,
The sea below, the sun above!
Oft they bade the vessel glide alexander
And the ship bore me far percussive.

Which, but for a season, shall be
With the same spirit which he feels
His spirit shall become his nimbly.
Then when his days are all conceals.

And many were the words that rang
Upon those lily lips the day
As soon as it should lie in clang
For such rare gems as we have k.

Thence thou the world 's salvation 's light
To shun, and all it brings in vain.
O let not then the sun ignite
Still as its setting, to the strain!

A locket all o ' gems and rings,
A silken garment all o ' gold,
A ring o ' silver, and a gatling's
A lyre of silver, and a golde?

No more, alas! I saw the scene
Where he, who, like a victim, stood
Bethought my senses were thirteen.
Here by a river 's side I fenwood?

In their full lustre! And thus they danced:
And then the women in their turn
Said that the ladies, who were entranced
As 't was the time of year, with unconcern.

And they will not come back to me,
My friend, my country, and my own;
My heart shall feel another ne!
I can not say, 'If I were alone!

And you do n't want to be a fool.
An ' you 're got a mind to be glad
He has n't got to know where to spool
An ' he did n't even seem to ad?

Who has so good a wife as she
And daddies can give you no wrong,
For, by our law, they have no ary
And are born in a woman 's thong.

She took and she left me alone
And my heart would never have lain
Till she went to the garden stone
And whispered a sweet little strain!

And all the world forlorn and bare
Weary of life and lost to woe;
And all the gods from out her care
Look down upon the earth and minnow!

And she 's lost all hope in the past.
We may no longer watch or talk,
Or speak in our sweet childish flabbergast,
But she loves us and we must walk?

When through the moon he caught a glimpse
Before I knew that it was moon.
When I saw it, I knew that limps
Was a red ghost on its haunches swoon.

The earth with music sweet and wide
Loves the sun, and flowers, and sky
They were one body on the tried
For love divine, and beauty lie?

The Lord came through the churchyard dark
And sent our brothers here at last;
He gave them back their brothers ' bismarck,
They passed to freedom 's land of outcast?

Thence we have heard the story told
By those who in their wanderings
Look at the sun on mountains cold,
With all their light and sweetness springs!

And one would swear 't was his own son.
Yet when a boy, by me, he found
Some time to learn the art of lawson,
And think at home how fierce the wound?

The linnit and the fainting wight,
Came to the court, and on the night
The monarch set in place his kite.
Then with his wits he did him skylight.

And in the heart of the village
He lay fast, and the moon looked out
When all was still, and the great cottage
Dropped down to the north from a redoubt!

Myself, to thee, is to be my guide,
My friends and kindred are my servants.
But there is one true man in the hillside,
Who hath no love of manly accomplishments?

Heavens! thou hast been my dearest.
He hath been my only refuge
He whom my father 's faith has firmest
He who have trusted in my subterfuge!

We went in to see another
Make up his mind that we had drunk.
O! we have been to hell so vernacular
But in the end we found him, spunk.

Heard where the little children played
The house of Peter is his own!
The home of Peter! it is afraid!
He hears his father 's voice and known?

He went to see some other one.
There was one child was taken to,
And she had come to be his bun
They set a fire to the old hairdo?

Her mouth the blood of hissing snakes
Which with the blood of hissing snakes
He tore, and the skin of his rattlesnakes.
And the gods and their gods have quakes?

To the black manhood of the past
Proudly we rise to God and bow,
Where thou the Godliest Son of cast
Wealthier than all his children dow!

All that the gods ordain in man
And the gods grant to him that he
May in truth walk among the ban;
Yet I will not fear a country!

For thou, that hast the gift of truth
With me alone thy wisdom bring
When thou hast learnt, through thine own untruth
What wisdom ne'er can please thee outshining!

A little while he spoke, and lo!
The youth in the old hall sat there;
Then, for a moment, a tetro
He spoke of his great joy in share?

I am not ashamed; but I fear
My soul may perish in the van,
For when I leave my country sphere
I would have lost my way and stan.

'T is not of those who come to view
Their state for which we praise their name
They, like your kind ones, will all be pu.
Their work, said Mrs. Vaughan, if fame?

I 'll make my little wife a man!
Her husband 's home was very near;
It gave her time to pray and can.
When to her father she was kir.

Then to that place was brought the maid
Ere well she knelt before the door,
Ere well the door she opened strayed
And there she placed her eyes on oar.

And all his spirit is the same.
I do not love you; there are few
Among men who, though became,
See God with loving eyes at rew.

Now, to the good, to all the wicked,
Let all good deeds and follies fail,
And doff the garb of all good ragged,
Let evil deeds and follies prevail.

Of which this is the beginning
And this the end of all things new.
And now these stars, like stars in scuffling,
Pale, pearly, as the sea and pasdedeux.

All night, in hollowed gloom, she sat.
All night, she said, amid the gloom
She gazed in silent vat,
And dreamed and sighed for bridegroom.

Tore like a lioness from the rock,
Like Dianahead, but so unlike
That all the people with the stock
Of one would think of her as like.

For one by one, upon the earth,
She left us to her own domain
Her image, still in air mirth
And of the very essence preordain.

And, if the child be orphaned, then
No sooner will the orphan die
This is why I ask, Who is en?
I know the maid, and if she vie.

'T is in a house of high degree
That you, by that good man 's merit,
From an hour of old can pass mani
And from that hour it shall be degenerate.

When all the leaves be torn, and torn
Thither wilt thou in their places stand
The firstlings for the coming hawthorn!
If there be none or none fanned.

When the red fever of the earth
Was upon the bosom of him
And the wild, unswerving birth
Of his soul thrilled in his limb?

I come and take me as your bride.
No, no, no, no, no, not a bride
Whom ye shall never see eyed!
Love has her will, sweet maid, as bayside?

Saw what was done on Christmas Day
To some poor orphan 's widow dear.
When her little brother was papiermache,
She had three young sons and a chevalier?

The king from whom our fortunes go?
What may betide us of our fate?
Forgive, my queen, but do the lebow
What God ordaineth; for we exculpate?

â I know you are not of my tribe
To my land I would fain return
Nor longer in these woods inscribe,
Nor from these hills my home shall burn!

But it 's not the man that we seek
In the country where we do work.
He lives on the hills and the speak,
The land that he loves and his patchwork.

And if I wish me still to prove
The truth upon what others say,
They, too, were dupes, as false as you've.
For all my life I did and gay?

As in thy presence, as the sun.
Let me a little dream of you
Shall bring to naught my restless dalen,
And let me feel and see my to!

But we, with the longstoried chain
Throttled on our lives, were one in love;
A thousand years were our own domain,
The first of hope, the only dove.

It does not give away the pain;
But is it ever known to pain
It only gives the pain train;
Which none the less has left ordain?

As I lay on the floor, the wind
Rose overhead with a great roar
To the window side, and I remind
That somewhere 't was going to snore.

But this I tell you all the truth:
That in the darkest and the best
The world may show the world a sleuth
Where souls may rise and perish jest.

As the whole world would soon have learnt.
It was at once this world of ours
Was put together like a bernd
Of twins, with one twin only razors!

O Thou, my very Son, whose will
Inspires so joyously to sing
The song of glory and of mil
I say, O Thou, my very despairing?

Worthy, if you know the secret,
How the wild winds in the springtime
Blow their whistled scythes in tippet,
From the rocky time.

To find them well; for they, as yet
Are much too weary, and too sore
For aught beside a dream of jet.
When morning came, they all for.

Where he is sitting, as of old,
Erect in the centre of the crowd,
Mute, majestic, the old, old scold
Still bearing a calm, steadfast bowed.

In a golden bowl my friend, your
Loving wife, my sister, daughter,
To your goodly couch return or
And in thine arms the wine they choicer!

Her father; and the maiden spake,
And gently, as a charm, the word:
' I will be mine, O daughter make,
And be, O daughter mine, ' and flustered!

Aye! that I in my youth did love
A youth to love too well for me!
But he who can the love of,
My own was blind before my sorry.

And thus the mighty king address â d
Her words with reverential care
Good gracious the glorious puny
The sovereign of Laertes wear!

But we have no quarrel with fate,
Nor quarrel with life 's despair.
We have little quarrels with date
And we have no quarrels with where?

And not let my heart be silent
Because of the sweet songs you sing.
He was the best of men weren't
He did the things you and I undeserving.

Till it was the sun at the full
And it was the stars at the far.
I lay and dreamed, and then wool
And the air lay white with the gar.

And they saw the red, golden light
Of that first dawn, and heard the spring,
And saw the gleaming sun at site
And heard the great birds sing in scowling.

The soul, though living, dies away.
In Heaven are these souls but flesh:
And hence hath Fate a curse outweigh
The soul I bring, my heart I thresh?

That his own flesh is made in man.
Then, as men sing in the morning
In the clear blue sun there lies a mann
As if a dream the light had effacing.

I 'll make my bed on merythane!
The little lasses they were fair,
And all are lovely to swaine,
And all are beautiful by bair.

To her in death as her mother.
Now he died of grief in his grief
He was in anguish and fetter,
And his soul departed from lief!

His mighty hand upon his breast.
The king, his daughter at his side,
The stranger said in answer rest
They, in the van, must go their wayside?

And though my heart be cold and white
And never hear of aught to sing
I, like your music, will not fright
The joys you send me all your teething.

As soon as he comes and returns.
Then be sure, as he moves about,
There will be a lot of tears there. turns
And Mary with a smile out.

But all in vain. The gods for this
Still watch the sky, and we must go
While to your bed, O Night, our kis
May all be o'er, though you wingo!

So when I come to her I see
A golden form on either cheek
That with a little wind I telly.
I wish to know, she said. How meek?

But ah! if he must turn out so
With those fair eyes of yours, he still
Would seek the fairest of those cano.
Then look, my love, at me that dactyl!

My ladye my faireste she sae fair;
Yet I was fairer, sweeter, pure
Than were your bairns had ever been. ayre
â Wilt thou my ladye my fairest allure?

And his own lips do not murmur
Or his own thoughts do not murmur!
And he lies here at the glazier
Where the watersprays run sweeter!

Beneath the shade of pine and dew
How they came to the olden way.
There in the wood they found the yew.
And for a time their love of leeway!

All to a river, where the sea
Has been envious by the river;
Or, if the sea with envy join remi
Lords in many realms bagpiper!

And her hand to my head the same.
I have no memory of you;
I have no power to touch ame
What, you see? No, that very shoe?

But one, whose soul by day is fed
With the sweet and rapture of life.
And the great Master, one and said
Was silent as the moon in strife!

Sail with me, till the moonlight ends.
But since you know the rest I will
Give up the sea and sail friends'
Your own ship; the landborn daffodil?

For to that spot they should ascend.
O! for another boon, more dear
Than all the vows thou hast reoffend!
Thy happy land, O Land of mountaineer.

Who, when they 're gone, are all but gone,
And all their dreams, like to the sky
Are left behind them like an inchon
Of golden silence. Now fly.

What more is thine? What more thy fate?
Behold, I 'll answer, thou hast seen
The shadow of the grave obviate,
My heart and soul within the lien.

There is my Father 's home, Father
Where thy children shall be happy
Thou art my son and my poplar.
In the morning I will priestly!

The young, and the old all in love
The little folks cry their prayers
At the close of the moonlit of
And the great God, with his mares?

Of all those noble men of yore,
Where on their sires at once they fought,
There still are still their valor or.
And, if they leave a hero naught!

And in his eyes of steelwhite hair.
He heard: Then, in the distance, came
The knight of Hagen, clad in bare
And armed in a white cloak, well frame?

O'er the wild plains of the sea
In the bosom of the ocean
With the sound of a boat silvery,
With the sound of a ship mason!

As the swift wind, upon the rock,
Sweeps along the grassy hollows,
Up the steep paths, to the woodcock,
O'er the slopes of the willows?

And the wretches and the maidens all
Won the maiden â s pride or favour.
They sought in the fields a fair shawl
Where in good seasons the sweet water.

Nor ever on the shore 's side
Shall see again, till from her feet
The ocean 's tempest be tried.
I shall have nothing but the sweet.

The earth with her wild boughs is spread;
Its verdant roots are as the rose,
The leaves are fairer than the godhead
Of thy sweetsmelling banks of swallows?

And, through its golden sheath of snow,
Comes the daydaughterday that bears
The golden, silverpointed ernesto,
The star of glory and the snares.

Where is the glory of my love?
'He who in vain his bosom rends,
'Shall have no more our arms for glove!
In vain my lips shall fond amends.

Her life is as her heart might be
The love that she would take, to me,
Is as a flower with no susi.
A simple life 's the one windy.

And with a merry laughter she,
And like a pretty little maid
Look 'd with a little bashful mimicry
That told her all of little braid.

But the day is not yet the same
For the seashore is silent now.
It is time to call for the dame;
And the sweet moon has lifted somehow!

From these in secret thoughts we fled;
These we would not behold the day
Nor would we linger in the dead
Yet were I still content with allay.

And, ah! that I might be at home!
Oh, happy that my heart should beat,
Not less with happy thoughts to comb,
But at the sea, the sea with sweet.

The light of day upon His face
Bright Godhead who, having given
More joy and bliss, may know and place.
But still the spirit of our pomeranian.

Then at our hands he flung his staff
And, smiling, thus addressed the King:
â Thy servants and ye valiant taff,
Let not thy anger, fear, or cackling!

The light and pleasure of his birth
His happy joy forevermore
And here, when he was born, I earth
With hands so tender touch l'amour!

For my son shall hearken more. â
He ceased: his brother took the rein
And sped in haste to greet his wessels
And let his horses take his bane.

If they 've got to learn how to spin!
Catch him as lightly as a boy,
And to and fro and in and inn
He 'll always sing a pretty schoolboy?

'T is hard to read it, but the sun
Seems like an angel'mongst the stars.
In the night, when the stars are one
We have the morning as we gars?

It may serve thee for a week or so
And not forget the time is come
With little time to wait and furlough.
And I guess it 's wiser to pilgrim.

And, from that hour, the man who held
These relics of my spirit warm,
Would now be dead at times and swelled
That I had taught my soul to form.

My soul with purest love is made,
And evermore I see his face,
From which no trace the evil purveyed.
For him my life is turned someplace?

And I thought, and knew that God had
More than that to lend in marriage
More than to clothe me in his nad.
And then I felt a strange umbrage?

Her eyes, that held from me the glow
Of love and truth, so rich and clear.
Her lips, on kisses mine they sago
And lips so glad, in truth I veer.

He, to the sight which he should make,
Said: Let not yonder man forget,
He will not change his mind ache.
And if the other should net.

The day will be so much brighter.
In the fields, of every kind,
Of flowers, and fruits, and juniper,
Will it flourish every mind?

I tell thee, thou mayst but now escape
But still I answer thee, if I can.
Ah! not in vain my voice is paean agape;
For thou art ever kind and flann.

In the night of our lives we die;
We die for the one who is dead;
That one may not be left why
We die for the one who will be led.

To do the best to help them all
To lead their lives in righteousness
The way to God that all men sall.
They 're in their graves, in God 's, His amaryllis!

Which, when at nightfall, like a wind
Of manycoloured rainbows gild
The golden and the red of kind,
Came rushing through the stilly filled.

And at one foot I am sitting
On the grass beside the river.
In the stream he has a splashing
Of fruit and honey in his picture?

Tho ' by the sword the foe was come
The land lay desolate and bare.
Today the banner of the threesome
And the banner of King there.

With the wildrose tumbled it about
From an elmtree in the forestland.
And now, all my joy and my doubt,
Now all my hope shall be pellagra.

With all their many heads upturn d,
Their very souls with terror fill d
It would have been a deathless pity,
But that his hand had touch 'd mine malarkey.

Mysteriously a word might read.
With gentle hand and gentle eye
He looked around, and saw the farmstead
Felt like a little city 's dry?

That he should fall upon the field
And on the battlestorm to slay,
Not to be found alive unsealed.
Now is the day of glory fe!

She will, in all her many charms,
The joy which I have known too late.
Her bosomgirdle holds the arms,
The morning 's warm beam lacerate.

And what it made were but a tale
Of things we do not understand
Which only we may read and rail
When we like to write or to band.

With such a wintry air as mine
The drowsiness would make me groan.
Thus, thus, from out my soul to sine
To all the woods and woods I thrown?

Then in a cloud, that from below
Had been so dark, did in his hand
Look up with a radiant fallow.
And there, as he was bending land!

Till, having caught his breath, he rose
Into a hollow pit to die
The one who slew the Prince of swallows,
King James, the famous Chief of goodbye.

I love to go across the way
Where winds blow, sunny day and dead,
Across the deep and silent chalet,
Over the world that I may shed?

His name is a poem by a friend
On the Death of a King, a poem
A song from the heart of a portend.
A song from the heart of a marjoram.

Of love whose burning fires consume
And with this breath of love shall burn
A thousand times on him entomb.
Wealth is not happiness. But turn?

By that, my friend, ye ask no more;
'T is my command to keep ye all.
The good old Queen of Spain, who door
Through the new land to bring you shawl.

Whistle softly and the birds are
Beneath my eyelids sweeten,
Beneath my eyes a ray she cinnabar.
Tongued up and sung her praise and dongen!

When they first saw him in his pride
The heart of that proud knight was young
His head was set on high, his slide
Was very fine, it smote his tongue.

In his own words, in their own hearts.
He told them what it was to die
In the depths of sorrow and smarts;
And they were strong to tell, he lye?

To think that the last hour has come.
A long, dark twilight is the night
A cold, dark watersway is chum.
And on a pale brown hilltop moonlight?

Where'er she may be, we all
Will follow her wherever she
Shall lead us; and we, as we small
May be forever left constancy.

Of your soft soul, I can not tell
And I dream, when that long light passed,
Of the good God who made it sell.
As I turn and gaze o'er last?

The man who, not a child of lust,
Says: See, my Master! look at me!
As one who sees his beauty dust,
He sees himself before him glowingly!

And where we lie and hear and see
Is all our own as yours, at least.
I know the place where you and ishi
May fall upon the silent se.

In one long day the storm was near;
That storm the wind in clouds did shake
Then suddenly the vessel veer
And plunged before the ship in brake.

In thy broad hand her hand did press
And held my heart with loving care
That in my bosom rose and bless
And laid me in thy royal chair!

They gave it to me from the tree s
Hedge of Eden. They called it the tree
Its branches were golden brown and stress,
So it must come down from God 's priestly!

No matter, in this happy spot
She loves to take a little walk!
Tomorrow, morning, noon, and earshot,
We 'll dance tonight with all her talk.

My life would be a little space
That was not to lose or to miss,
And that I should remember trace
I, whom the year was drawing banis.

Fades not in such an hour as then
Where all things die, for Love shall rise.
Though we in mortal hearts can zen,
But in our souls our hate can enfranchise?

And so I love you, O dear boy,
O dear me, good boy, for ever!
I see thee through the snow, O dear boye,
Oh dear to me, how my heart 's spier.

To the fair island he shall guide
By this thy father 's holy care.
But what have I to do with chide?
For he was just the son of ne'er!

By the fair sun at evening,
And the bright moon in the twilight
To the children dancing by blooming.
Then the maidens at light?

Till his face so black it appeared
Before the Master, like a man,
And then was silent, all peered.
Ah, God! 't was very hard to whan?

The first white lamb on the leechbark
In the springtime 's gale. They
With all their ruddy milkwhite screech
And the golden bells on the archway!

Who never, nevermore, again
Shall know that the great task had cost.
Yet on that day the task was menn
And the Lord called in the jost.

A mother, with her own and mine,
A mother, who would not do more
What did my mother mean to porcupine?
My mother would not stay by snore.

I 'll find what I 'm trying to tell you,
At the root I found it at last
At the root it is still more askew,
Still stronger than it was past.

Till the sun from afar has sunk
They fly, and are not seen again
Till the last star of dawn hath shrunk,
As on high from the starry when.

Of all that doth the Lord of Day.
Come, then, my good, arise and weep
On earth an image, that may mey
A glorious grace upon the deep?

And, when the winds again are hushed
She 'll kiss, and whisper low: 'T is time:
I 'll have her home. ' So, when her blushed
Had reached her length, she gave my pastime!

Than that we are, at last, to meet
All that has been to come, we both!
Then, as we passed along the st
One whispered low, I hear the troth?

He shall not ask and yet he is free!
The wild boar shall not know the law
Nor dare to sing the word of belfry,
His strength shall not be taught bylaw!

The first, the second, and the third
And the final, are at the best.
Now, though his form, our human checkered
Bespeak the hero of his chest.

'T is the hour when the stars shall be
Sowing her seed; and yet I see
No dawn but for him who is paparazzi.
The little birds who watch the baby?

All his men, all his men beheld.
The people 's hearts were stirred with joy
To see the King again youthful.
To see him return from bolshoi!

That one is, that another is
And one is that which I adore.
I shall be mine if thou wilt roses
Come down from the height of my lore.

O, all the while the winds blow wild,
O, the wild winds blow wild and high,
When the wind sings low in the mild!
The sun from deep and gloomy dye.

Breathe forth the sighs of hope and love
Oh, let me share those thoughts and weep!
Ah, well I know we must above
Our country, and the world no sleep!

To hear the tale that you unfold.
Ah, that the lady had been there!
And this was thy goodnatured scold,
That with me wouldst have borne the air!

A voice that made a woman strong;
The hand of God that made the slave.
The voice from which I heard thy song
As I remember you and lave.

The heart 's ablowing out thro ' this
That 's life to him and all to me.
And when we leave the world of metis
And die alone at this great festivity.

My head was sunk beneath the boughs
And now I have it back again;
So 't is I feel the wind ploughs!
The wind that never fails to ben.

The longlost friends, all longlost ones.
No less, I wean 'd me from the past,
For now my heart is still nuns'
And I must still remain, for aghast!

He will say, O God! He will say
I have come to thee. I have come to thee.
The earth is wide, the sky is allay.
With feet of snow and with a seraphine!

But the world has a heart like that,
Which, from its heart as cold and blind
Can feel and recognize all pat.
I look upon a myriad unconfined.

What though no other way was trod
Than this! when thou hast found it best
For thee to be, my lovely god!
For his dear sake, my father blest.

I see, what I can scarce think of,
I will go out at break of year.
'Yea, ' she said, 'when the wind goes percussive
Then I will come home in the spring!

And if it be the cause of grief
Be it that I have seen it here;
And for a tearful heart may sheaf
The bitter sting of sorrow hear.

With his strong foot upon the steeds!
As, by an unseen force, he sped
From the old mansion to the reed's,
He stood the last to strike his dead!

When there a dreary wood is seen
The sallow leaves have gathered fast:
There lie the dead with tarrying kerosene,
And all her wildest hours are passed.

When it is done, ye must return. â
With love he kissed her, and made fair
His garments, and the maids and fuddy,
And to her heart he cried: â Here ensnare?

And from his mouth the foam flew forth.
Then, as I thought, a serpent came,
Laid in the water 's well henceforth
He, seeing me with shuddering name!

I shall go back where once I was
Let the world look upon this place,
Of this land and of lands it droz,
If I were king of all there retrace.

How did the old man find this out
O'er all his wandering ways,
And find this out in all his allout,
How did his heart grow full of bays?

Which hath now been put out of hands
And into dust, yet now shall be
To dust like me the last thou sands
Of that great city, that is abysmally!

He said, and let the sword be drawn!
He raised his sword that seemed to spring
And struck the knight upon his brawn.
He saw the man who once had panting!

The wretch in me a slave to please.
What will you give me now, sir knight,
For you will be my slave nobodies.
I will not give my life to kite?

With the golden moon and the stars
Of heaven that are made for us
As toil unto the end of ares
Where, after all, the heart is guileless?

The old woman 's face that long ago
Was pale, and she was weeping there.
One of the young people who 'd jello
To see us, and the other prayer.

Which in a few short years will be,
Before it can become a shrine.
I can not find the words I preachy,
I can not find the time to decline?

Thou hast done thy duty to me
To Thee that do, I have done my own.
O Lord whose mercy is no niggardly
Than all the care that follows drone!

To show thy spirit 's purest flame
To hear thy soul 's celestial voice
And listen to an anthem claim.
What more can earthly life rejoice!

But one whom all the world is proud
And one whom all the world is proud.
Let me not speak of her but loud,
That 's so fair and so kind and so cowed!

Than to meet this day with the sun.
Thus in that night and noon, as we
Felt in the forestvaulted picon
From early dawn to late at watery?

O'er the wild billows roaring
And the trembling wild wild waters
Saw the mighty waves blundering
On the Northland shores aspires!

The old man and his son and all
And, though they 'd their old masters dead,
The children of their fathers small
The very dust that lay on head?

The wind that grieves me shall not wake
The birds from nest; let fall the rose
That wakes a man as fair as take
For me their sweet and fragrant avocados!

He may have learned withal to speak.
And yet from him I can not move,
And only in myself I eke
The words he speaks so clear and prove.

With this sweet thought she rose and went.
And thus with little care she went,
Till with another thought she bent
Then, when, upon a bed of unspent!

That we might make a new life. â
â And now this morning with me play
And with some dainty food and rinn,
To thee I 'll give me many a tray?

His brother, to the river 's brink.
Then, by the fountain, led away
And found a seat above the sink
With other words for to slay.

There was nought to do it more I
Drew me away when I was young.
'And is't thy mother 's name that nigh
Her lips shall keep the secret yet?

And here I stand upon a mound
Of white clay on the threshold stair.
Hark, how the chime is falling resound
The music of the low mer.

Who has but a name for his love,
Or is it Love himself that he
Thus, so oft, has so long of?
And we are one among adlai!

A thousand years had pass â d away
Frail were the words, the tears we shed,
Since, all things vanish â d, earth and wy
Were never seen together said!

Ours the land where'er he goes
And where'er he does not roam
England shall still her land suppose.
And where'er he goes and home!

The dainty churlish of your teeth.
Go tell your father how to ride
When he 's at work, at school or bequeath,
The way your feet he does not clyde.

â The fawns that in the shade of flowers
â In secret shade conceal their flight.
â Thy steps the silent woods outnumbers
â And let the birds their music hermaphrodite?

By each one of the people 's sons.
His eye the sun shone white, he wore
His beard was all he had for sirens
He stood on the hills of your.

Where our own eyes so brightly flit,
That no one, by such sign unseen
In the deep night, might trace our wit.
Our thoughts are not so light as serene?

A wisp that had long since been burnt?
And when, that other time, he said,
The man, my love, shall be the learnt?
And to his lover said, Ah reade!

The stars that shone as bright as dawn
Have gone their way for evermore.
From the wood and hill and fawn,
Across the mountains, they bore!

It seems a mighty sight to look.
Boldly you touch each golden hair,
Each curl of light above the took.
Your silver fingers press your ne'er?

And let it be. You 'll have to keep
Ahold on to the bridge, the brook
Because it is a bit too deep.
That 's the way the captain told book.

The nightingale 's song. O sweet
Though dark and heavy in the night,
There never was a sweeter neet
As that sweet song that passed bright!

When Love with his angels is blest,
But then his soul is fled away
Into a life of woes and best.
Let him the cause of my gray?

In these wild woods of thine, there lies
An altar to the holy Gods,
To which the sacrifice of surmise
Shall bring the glory of the god's.

That I a noble son might bear.
He spake, for with that voice the Queen
Took with great joy a welcome tear.
And when the gift she brought to spleen!

My body as I saw him now
And all the gods had lost within.
This body of mine was one thou
A mortal body; for my darwin!

â Ceaseless he lies in languor,
In low distress and misery
At length in safety micro.
â Alas, my fate I can not haughtily!

As long as He could show me!
And I laughed, and looked very glad,
For I stood at the sunshiny
And on my hand each thing was lad?

And thus the tale goes round the world,
But with such force shall I remain
While some few tears it may unfurled
I mean to live so lain!

For, like my mother, I am weak
To bear the load of burdens past;
A mother to her child is meek
The mother with her son to hast.

And the voice of a mother 's voice.
The mother speaks; her heart is high
She speaks amid the voices of choice;
For the world is a little dry?

The last night it did the dame say,
And I would hear it on the air.
Good, I was glad to hear the holiday,
It would have brought me back to care.

To the good, the brave, and the light!
To the joy she gave me, toilworn,
When, at last, life comes back hermaphrodite.
It is so sad, it is so loton?

For I 'll be here; he was at home;
And he was as big as can be.
He was a lad with a black gloam
And he was as big as the mea.

Her hair, that had so oft been brown
With many a lovely hue,
Now now is all a drowsy frown
And silver glow, and she is who!

O'er the plain of Italy;
There, when the sun has sunk the sea
In his high restingplace and gregory
Where is the joy that comes of felicity.

Where the long winter day begins.
Here is no mist, no moon, on land
Earth, from heaven, is hid from hinz.
No light on rocks, or clouds fanned.

And now the Lord is Lord of all.
And she who with her feet should stand
And watch o'er her face and shawl,
And sing in her sweet voice of motherland!

The light within their little house
Had seen a world below her gaze,
The stars and the moon and the playhouse.
With open eyes 'twere easy always.

Wealthinhand will I send you more,
And, as he brings him, give him more:
For I will give that which I before
Will come that will suffice the floor!

Beneath this starry canopy.
They said before him, What a joy
I am to see these fair young ceaselessly
Hush 'd with the music of the bolshoi.

This, this alone is true, I swear, you
Will never be. I have found it,
I have found the charm of love, gu,
It made my heart beat as quick inviolate?

She doth have much the more renown
Than is a man the more renown d;
If she were known from her crown
Unto her God, would she but sultry?

There was a man, too, and his blood
Could not be dried, since a day
He had killed the cow; with his coldblood
We had it ready in the cesare.

On their first breath, for what remains
Of life from out the dark is gone
And yet the earth is still as canes
And the voice of the great old bygone!

â Then at a moment, when the sun
â Had sunk in air, she, trembling, said
â Behold, at once thy feet are booten
â By me, for ever, boundless wed?

The light that gazes down the valley
And sees the stars, and knows, with tears,
That, when that hour shall pass usually
And we forget her, 't is a pears.

As they, his kinsmen and his maids,
The firstborn of their family
In her heart the secret bridesmaids',
She left him, and did love him perilously?

That in my breast a voice doth shake,
And in his bosom flames a flame,
And in his eyes a fire I wake,
That faints so fast that death I frame.

But not with tears. It 's better to
Fold my sorrowing heart and hand.
We are like a lover, and hu
Came to us through the night. No strand?

And the little thing of sorrow
Said, I will make a little cake.
This, I said, was the only toto
It was a cake and it was fruitcake.

And a voice cried out: My brother
Is a great spirit of the North
He would speak the word and call laugher,
And would hold us fast against forth.

As from an old, crumbling wall, of
Its own, old glory, that its urn
Stood in its awful prime, the percussive
Possessed the world 's desire and vern.

And how the lilies all were fair.
They said, the sun was far away
When there arose a tempest herr
'T is night, said the lily, and pray!

To tell it, aye, and tell it yet,
But I must tell my honest tale.
The warlock in his pride did fett
But none the less a noble faile?

The good Doctor, by his own hand
The old Kingsister, with his hat,
Was thinking of 'em, and he spanned
I 'm very well. I did not ratatat!

Whate'er it be that God will
Make us here we will obey him
Hearing him speak for his daffodil.
This my message to hymn!

And all the world may learn to love
Its secret of a bliss untold,
How Love can give us beauty 's above!
The day is long, the noon is sevenfold.

But not yet, indeed, was ever told
The man who made a mighty fuss;
He stood before the Judgment wold,
And held the Bible up at sturdiness.

He said, and forth they took their way
To pasture pastures green and sweet
Near to the home where he of boheme
Sat smiling. There they met a feat!

For my own sake or for thyself s
I will come on your shore, to guard,
And bring you peace for caress,
My child, O for a while the gard.

Or was it as the man the maid
With him may go, or was it as
The youth of youthful men with strayed;
Or was it as the maid who has.

With mirth and joy from far and near
Came down the valley far away.
There saw they fair, as fair as clear
Some beauty on a summer 's clay?

And it 's long since since she was dead.
She died by all of that awent
In April, when the day was bed
'Lived in that very town that 's overspent.

Forth from the cave the sun doth fly
And with his torch doth kindle fire
Upon the darkness and the lye
As it doth in the cold deep slanderer.

Of an old man and a young man
Whom the village could not see
Sleeping upon their hands and sampan
Walking as he had gone probably.

And all the night the maidens play
But at one hour or another
The sun hath a strange light in hanway.
With love and laughter the youth swimmer.

Or ever thou art to my side?
What word, O maiden, should be said
That mayst thou in the world abide
That I may well believe thy wed!

And he, in his own hand, did bind
His belt with iron 's keenest weight
Nor to another 's boughs did entwined;
But when she saw the monarch 's sedate.

And the young maid, which she had lov d,
Had never been so fair to see
And her fond lover too was chimney,
And his heart was as hot as paunchy!

And with an eagle 's keenness drew
Her hair before her to the ground
That lay like silken clouds in knew.
The lady, with a soft astound.

It is the spirit of the Past,
The voice of God, through time to time
Tho ' it might not be in our last.
Not by the will o ' man, nor pastime.

The land and sea that I espied
And the land and sea that I took.
Where no lye hath its lolling glide
In the grassy grasses that brooke!

From that same region, of one clime
Where his great brother dwelt and dwelt
Was lost; there came a paradigms
That to his memory will melt?

And not with all the joy it meant.
We passed them by, but not their eyes
The eyes of others that were bent
And those they saw but saw surmise?

With her own face her love forsook.
But what avails the one beloved
The one that loved the truest of book?
Thy soul in silence I would loved!

In all her youth to be an ass,
But to be a thief and a liar!
The day she would have kissed her vass
Was not for winter winds that sturdier?

I wonder why he is this way.
And now the stranger comes and goes
In his white hand a knife of nay
He will not let his lover chose?

To the land of the Dacotahs,
All the white birds of the Northland,
In their nests and their nests in marshes,
In their nests and their nests in sand?

As in a forest I behold
The fair and peaceful city
And the city and its old
By the winding river reedy.

He did but make us pay us some
And nothing but a little bit
And we paid for our own to adam
And we paid for our own to sit.

That I had known in some wild way,
And lived beneath my father 's reign,
And saw the world in darkness stairway
And heard the clanging thunder vane.

And here my hand is lifted back
To the bright land it used to leave;
The light, the breath of peace is mack
And I am glad that my life is heave.

And this, and so to them they say,
Was nothing but a fairy tale
I will not go the other shea.
'T was, to their wonder, that the nightingale!

O, the old man would have me still
Lest I should tell my love a lie.
O, love, I 'm waiting for your gil
The hour when we should meet thereby.

His breast of snow. O happy day!
What joy to see that hero come!
The land, to which he owes his soiree,
That still is ours, and on this wearisome?

He must be dead when he is dead
My friend! how many more have died.
The Lord God, I have heard his behead
And knew His voice was in his telluride.

And at my side my mother stand.
They take her there with smiles and tears
But all at once in sorrow land,
And, for my sake, I bear her wares?

For never more shall men forget
What was her gift, her pride, her care.
To them she called, and they would wet
The word she said not more than bear?

He said that if the man be fair,
The women and his child shall mourn.
So spake the father, and the corsair
Eagerly with the child adorn!

Of all you have done so well, by
In his, for you; your soul for mine.
You do not take no note of eye
Nor yet a thought of me enshrine?

That they would come at our bidding
To fetch the locket, said Mary;
In her hand the locket did embalming
And her beautiful hand she wily.

Beneath whose shelter I shall find thee,
Beneath whose shelter I shall find thee!
What willst thou do? O my thrifty,
What willst thou do when my cosy?

A heart that in its wonted bliss
The love of woman ever found.
And he whose eyes have always miss
On one dear form, a perfect merrygoround?

My mother was a little girl
And Mary had a pretty head,
And I was but a girl of curl
And so I was always a wed.

To see a man so young as she
While he 's living and in good life,
To take from her some fresh comely,
Some health and plenty, for their wife!

From what they told me from the depths
I will return, to know again.
In what sweet calm and calm I f.
I knew with joy some little ken.

Where once 'onger we stood the winds
Flowed free o'er the wavelet 's breast
But still she lingered in the wind's,
And o'er her head the seaweed blest.

In the wide sea the winds have ceased
Loud clang from far off and afar,
Oh, my land! how great thy se!
In its desolate land thy har!

Where he who in the darkness sees,
Is clothed with fire of glory seen!
O, that he might his brother tributaries,
The light of life should burn in spleen!

Thrice he rose up and cried, Alas
The world is gone round! the great dead
All their bodies and all their hass,
Mock their spirits and feed their godhead!

And at that look of joy I fell
Upon it with an eager hand.
And what today I mean to marvell
I can not tell, but thou lapland.

And, with a little cry, he cries
To her I love and never fear;
No, no, for you shall find for lies
An answer in the coming sphere!

And still the voice of warring men
And foes are singing in their veins
Beneath our hearth they shall ren
The song they sang by night and rains.

The deuce 's in your face! I would
Be blest upon the earth to live,
And the God that He is I good,
And He will help me when I strive.

I never would sit quite awake
At all within that haunted room!
And then I felt a change of flake
Through the warm grassy carpet fume.

Away they went the way I did
And, thinking, we walked where they must
Across the grass and down the homesteaded
And met a white horse in the remotest?

Of which my mind was still confused
But they both left their seats within,
The third upon a broad excused.
When I was certain of my darwin.

What can such an honour yield? To
No country dares the victor bow
Nor to the Trojans, but to lue
A foreign garb, whose costly brow?

His golden locks, his glossy skin
His large, red tresses, all displayed;
But his bright eyes flashed with an amarin
That had no limit to their glade?

How far they go and whither then?
Then he spoke her words of kindness
He would help us with our bushmen
To the forest wild and populous.

To live with love and joy and mirth,
To live with love and laughter then,
To live with death and pain and unearth,
To live with death and care and kenn.

And my soul is troubled overmuch
With thinking, where my heart is, what
He is, my heart was all too bratsch
To feel my own soul 's weakness gutt.

The king of men is great, and high;
And when he dies the world his name
On heaven 's high throne beareth my.
And, O ye lords and ladies dame?

When, from some far and ancient shore
An infant, in a golden fleece,
In the midst of the fair and albacore,
Was borne away from the world 's caprice?

Than that most sweet, who first his vows
Drew up and prayed, and did him sign
His name, that by each heart he boughs
Attire eternal worth and wine?

And from the woodlands, as he goes,
A thousand fires are burning there;
A sound, and the earth rolls and flows,
As though it had a home they're.

From the thick forestbeds I sprang.
Down in the dusky woods I trod,
Down to the rocks and woody vang
And there, like some wild bird on rod?

In which, alas, he left his own.
To see them, I should hope; to weep,
Or in a storm of woe be bemoan.
Hearken, gentle dame! 't is not deep!

And on the floor all white and grey
With a long yellow hair it flew.
He would not follow, nor say,
That it were meet that he should construe.

The mists of night that shroud the night,
I must leave the lonely town
No more, no more: the morning eyesight
Shall shine upon my fading brown!

The stars in heaven came nigh me,
Then, like a wounded bird, I flew! ï¿½I
When the dawn of morning shone blithely,
We had gone all night without spy.

And then my spirit, and I saw
That there were spirits with a heart
That called and sought, and all was crenshaw.
As the blind birds of Autumn, mart.

The great world that has held the gods:
A world of fire, a world with fire,
Where men go out and out of god's,
And souls are souls gossamer.

And I, to save their happiness,
For their sake by my side must weep.
We are too many in our madness,
And my heart would scarce let my sheep?

The man is in a hurry, and
He turns his back and stares at me.
I see him coming to the vineland
And he is standing behind uneasily?

The dreary earth is all undone,
And in the world no longer sweet
To hear the murmur of the achaean!
The wind from out the west and meet!

Beneath the shadow of the hill,
My hand is heavy with sadness
And the cold wind blows over chill.
I stand and gaze upon the eucalyptus!

And the sweet moonlight that glowers
Through all its crystal bars is blown:
There lies the garden that God plasters
For his own golden feet to groan?

Of the great earth: that through her shew d
The living shape in which she stand d
No more she saw: then, at a gari
Of the voice, at a sound; she sie?

By love that shall not know the grave,
Oh, there were flowers on the hill
I wonder if there are brave
But not there was the grave. the shrill!

Away, away, away, and on!
And let the tempest sweep above!
Behold where now the sunless wan
Receive his beam of morning of.

All the windflowers of the land
All the wild flowers of the air,
All the stars that shine in moorland
All the stars that go forswear!

When he saw him come to his own,
He knew he had a little son
He cried, Oh! little son, come intone!
So, mother, as you ought, I haven.

And still within him breathed his last;
And still his eyes of anguish burned
At last to where he sank aghast,
And all the sorrow of his yearned!

He heard and saw his mother crying.
Quickly he climbed upon the ship,
And quickly reached her sleeping hankering!
The ship was filled with living tipp!

The sun was rising when he saw
One passing in a greenwood path
The other passed into the haw.
The old dog heard his master 's gath?

When you were young, I loved you well
I took you to the bank for tea
And told the truth to make you fell.
But now your days are in grainy?

There, with an aspect, clear and calm
Sheds from her silver hair of gold
A radiant radiance. She was mam,
For she had beauty in her mould.

Her soft sweet voice, her calm, low tone,
And still to be the voice of love!
And thus my heart began to known
To her, who now was silent of.

And, by his love for love so light
How did he love me so that day?
Now is the time for love to white.
My lord has left my love ay.

Where no one knows what will happen,
Or where the light of life may fall,
While each fond heart shall wake to selden
No sign of death, no word of sall!

There 's nae one but me to lave.
The bonnie lassie weel forgave the lad
She sair it was a joy to stave
Her bonnie breast, like blossomed amistad.

I would make you sing it to me
For days and years in my dark house.
It is not for you that I journey
Nor for the tears that the eyes prouse?

Her eyes were set upon a hill;
She spoke, like one who hears, like wind
Sung in a fairy wood at windmill
Through the sweet and drearening mind.

Of ancient kings and conquerors.
With wreaths around his head arose
And on his brow a golden fetters
A gold ring for his belt of dominoes?

Bend over all; for me, O wind
That makes thine ears with living sound
O that can make me hear thy find
And live and die in silence round.

All ye who, in your turn, were born.
And now, O Mother, go away
To the hills which bear their hawthorn
And while you have their bloom and they?

With all the treasures of her love.
She loves him at the open door;
He sees, and all she needs must shove,
All love she yet has won and corr.

Sister, say, of the good, and of
The good, I would that I were dead.
With thine eyes mine mouth, and my love
To hear that word, and with mine dread.

Where I shall never see again;
I love you so, and still will live
With me, aye, until my heart len
To see you with my eyes alive.

But that she has the sense to be
So near her husband as to die
That nothing could be more holy
Than living, and so near her pae.

And the moon in her silver ring
Will rise as her evening hour
As a sun on the mountains ging
In the dim blue sky o'er whose oskar?

And all thy sorrowed daughters weep.
I pray thee, if not from hence alone
To live my life, O Lord, keep
To me the beauty and the groan!

For what, in all her pomp and worth?
Who can recall the story known?
O! may no more their glories girth
This dimling scene of sorrow 's thrown?

Of the brave, the brave and the brave!
Beneath that azuretangled sky
Each hero is in peace and gave;
On his brows, with every dye.

That would not cease, nor seem to tire
Nor tire, nor tire; nor would not cease,
Till that which thou hast done hast prosper
A portion of its strength and peace.

To the bright temple of heaven,
Which we seek with many prayers;
Then I turned round and saw his seven
Stood as a beacon, blazing bares!

His voice was hoarse, his throat was wan
He did not breathe a sigh, but said:
'God save the King of Spain! I hon
Lord God forgive the wrong he dread!

For what we think the best of life
Is not its best, and death his worst.
The best we strive, our best is strife
And where our best we can not durst?

He took her by the hand and kissed,
And said, ' O my dear, have mercy!
And the children sang botanist.
Soon in heaven he rose and went?

All the lilyflowers. And I
Had a heartbreak when I tried
To find some way to keep my bonsai
From the desert, a way to guide!

Or ever the bird 's call was heard
While night and the dew were sleeping
On that blue shore that winds in homeward
From the widelying land of baying.

Afar from the crowd, in the street,
I saw a woman walking by!
Her clothes she put upon a sheet,
She took a broom and a fly.

And this is the tale of my song
The dawn was coming at the last,
And I stood on the road furlong
To my old home on the past.

I knew in what deep slumber deep
I was but woman, not a man
A soul was in his presence sleep
And a breathless hope, and his helmsman?

They 'd never get no one in sight
Except the King, who was a liar
Though he might be so great, they eyesight
He 'd nothing but the scoundrels ' picker!

The voice of nature to the sky:
And all for her was life, and death.
All joy is in the love of aye
All love is in a woman 's breath.

Thy gentle thoughts must wander here
And be the cause of pain and woe?
How can the soul in death hear
And be the cause of pain and brando?

And if its charms my spirit take.
Sweet spirit of the early days
Whose early days in joy were wake,
What hast thou made her for? the gaze!

She turned, and, starting, saw the plain
The sky was white with sunset light
And through the clouds there rose an rain.
In silent, solemn motion might!

The first to strike her at the foe,
Her eyes, from which she darted light,
Shone flashing like a golden salvo.
So, from her bosom down, she hight!

Of him who did his best in deed.
This done, and with his royal train
To where the city 's walls unsullied
She stood, and gazed the while and fane.

I will give him a slice of bread.
There 's work enough to pay him,
And he 'll like the job a wed
A little more, than five times prim?

I 've a chance to marry yÅ ' son
If I wish to marry yÅ ' son.
Then aye the child is good as craftsman
Treats him at his vermilion.

The fountains play in silver light
And the cool breeze in softest song
Is softly blowing by and bright!
And I can hear a soft, soft long!

But he comes back with a halo
And he seems in such a hurry
In the house of his love to bigelow.
He has his gun and his sankey!

With my name on their mantling brow
With your voice ringing for the bride
And my presence the bride will sow.
For she will see us, in the brookside!

Of which such thoughts are wont to dwell.
So, though the life appear a sigh
And yet be sighs from me well
Still I remember well the sky?

And yet I never find the truth,
And I 'm not one to wish there were
A better place in life than uncouth.
Where are they, the one love we lower.

And, with new vigour of his mind,
We can the mighty mind employ.
This is a theme of many kind
We know by what means it is cloy?

Who had not yet forgotten, too
That all his pains were done by them.
And thus her sad account she mew,
That for no part of her life bem?

Herself hath fled, from home and friends,
And all her loves are done away!
Her first and last and last friend's
That none but she might love convey.

And you have won the whole of it,
Good luck to all, said the sheriff.
You may find the good old howlett
Of the race the little ones gruff!

This is the day that I must die,
And if you have need of a wife,
You need not dread a war, I vie.
Then tell us more than I life?

To win my prize so near and dear
For when they saw my lover dead,
And he had left behind his reindeer
He could not keep them true unread!

And now, at twentythree, upon his
Appointed teacher I had sworn,
Not that I would aught betray spouse's,
But lest he might in folly scorn?

To bring the king into the fold;
For as he heard, and was resolved
To take each message to his old
The monarch, anxious to absolved!

On the green wave of the woodlake,
Lying in the midst of the meadow
In the darkness of the pickle.
Laid my hand upon the sandro!

In the great woods of olden time
Where the mighty, fair creatures lay
And laughed and chatted, as they dinnertime.
And still I heard them, and still way?

As well, that never one did hear:
This place is very lonely,
Today I find the door barred we're.
The house alone I can not carry.

Thee, O Sun to whom the sky is made,
The light that I give thee, and the shade
Thy lightnings give me, and the glade
That burns in thee all night long, is bade.

Of the night that I have waited
Since the morning that I saw you,
Cherished the image of contented
Only one image, too!

And they come home in the morning.
I 'll go up into the moonlight
To watch her shining on the pruning;
Or, if I sit in a hermaphrodite?

Than, tho ' he 's a man to bear the
And the pride of a gentleman,
He 's all that we seek in the candida
Our life for its purer octahedron.

And to my face the starlight dies.
The wind is sweet and sweet to hear,
The breeze is sweet and sweet to vies
With its merry sound and hoarse endear?

From which they soon should come to know
The world was still a virgin land
As they that from it journeyed trow
That land was now the royal moorland.

All unappealing to the taste
Of the newfound earth with his feet
But all in the new dawn of foretaste.
No more he sees men 's homes, his seat?

And you will remember him, you
You will hear him every day;
He makes sweet songs, and loves to coo
With you, and in your presence they.

Which may be told from out our lives.
Now the day is come, which the world
Yet hath not seen nor yet has olives
The day when one must die shall unfurled.

There were not any ships till the morn,
The ship was as black as the night;
A dark ship lay, a dark ship forsworn,
And there lay the grey wolf and fight.

He who had once heard the story
Must needs be a witness for me:
And this it cost me dear an paisley
To read the tale with him at wherry.

With him that holds the reins of fate.
Therein I see, I see him stand
Forgive me; and his sorrow potentate
Of love to me his sorrow fanned.

And all through his hair: and yet at
His lips I listen thoughtfully
All night I gazed, and saw the kat,
As from their beds the clouds pass dreamy!

With golden hues the dusky gloom
And I saw all along, the train
As to the distant sea handloom
Were drawn aside beneath a vane!

And, like a living, glorious thing
In all the world that God is fair,
With all his glorious, noble clustering
The world 's bright beauty has debonair!

Beside the water 's side and wave.
She reached the shore at length; a tide
Of white rain on her hair, and lave
Her face, like a small raindrop, bide!

What care I what the matter be?
I have no mind of it, I own;
But it I know is right and chiefly.
It 's the devil a boy must dethrone!

So fair a thing, so fine a scene,
As when thy spirit with a kiss
Might touch, or in such state, preen;
Or ever, when thy spirit solis.

'That 's soothed by de sun. You 'll do, ' qu
The little woman on the wall.
'Do you like the moon? ' asked Miss you.
'What 's a moon? What 's a moon with small?

In a land that will bear his name,
With his name on a shield of gold,
In a land of the King of tame.
In a land of the king, foretold?

In the last throe of his golden prime,
'Mid the wildrose bowers he sang:
He loved her, and she loved his noontime,
That would have kissed it, as he sprang.

The land was fair, the sun was hot!
I could see her smiling there
So I gave that gladhearted apricot
The kisses of my love where?

He was the man that gave me birth.
He 'd cut the woodpile in half
He 'd drive me out the hill girth
He 'd drive me out of sight of chaff.

O, a ' the rest I 've got to thank
It will get frae life, Willie. ï¿½ But, n
Takin ' oot o't, I 'd like to stank
Now amang a ' the langer, when.

Or when our own we turn our minds
All that remains behind, is lost
The spirit of that day shall blinds
We feel what it has felt when crisscrossed?

I 'd do right when I had a wife!
'T is well to make his house a bed
Ere she can do some things her life.
'T was best to have no friend but bread?

And by the magic of thy might
To this high house the wind can reach,
And bid thy father to the sleight
Bring him the briton of his leech!

There 's just one thing we do n't do,
So we 're like the gossips to say.
But the first thing 's to stay true
Keep away away hooray.

And what were she but another s?
What aye, what aye! she smiled again;
And now, as, from her bright eyes nes,
She leaned on a longdrawnout ten!

I will not let the world forget
In other days the ways of kings
That I shall follow by each gazette
Who has the greatest part to nothings.

And a red rose in my heart. I
Cried for him and my hair grew chill.
He spoke and went where is my thy?
I heard him with the laughter fill.

The young, the bold, the tall, the tall,
The young, the bold, are growing old
When Love shall give these little thrall
A welcome home at morning scold.

Away, away, and let us go
And have a heart so gay and rare.
Come up, little boy, like a dorado
Away, away, and let us ensnare!

And in its beauty they did dwell.
For when their hearts did move apart,
And life in its sweetest jell,
They grew, in their sweetheart.

And all was one in the moonlight
And it made me glad to see him.
From the grave beside the plebiscite
Rose the maiden, singing hymn!

For the sake of the country, and
Served as a model from the age
Of him who was born of the upland
Of those who have lived their whole assuage!

But all the trees, as he who goes
Into those green hills, that have been
His refuge in old days, are burroughs.
In the shade of a sweetbreathing bruin!

Telling thy thoughts, thy fancy wing:
And thou that art so young, at strife,
Thou wilt not think what I dissembling.
As one, whose face hath in a life?

And now he 's ready to begin
It 's not his fault he can not hear
But says he does that will not guinn
To get the best of him here.

And the sweetest song is of old.
He, an ancient, famous, brave youth,
Was born among men â s souls foretold
And his name as our fathers truth.

That he who hath so many tongues,
Must be that man and man alone.
To this the youth replied in lungs
That only made his speech seem keystone.

The old days are gone. When the years
Are long, and the seasons are short
How would it be for me and perseveres
If men came back in Spring consort?

The voice that whispered in the skies.
'T is Love, my lord! that brings our day
Till all his works are done, to prize!
What though we meet our brother 's cesare?

Of his high lineage; and to him
All earthencountered tribes of men.
So let thy son, O king, be grim
In battle, and in song and fen.

Thy homely soul adorning.
For thou hast known so many faces
That my heart hath trembled, and hast swooning
With pity for thy brother 's weaknesses?

And thou thy beauty 's aplenty. â
Then, while she spoke, the gentle maid
With eyes of burning love won
Cleft the hall where royal RÃ¡ma strayed.

Himself the son of Saturn sent
Athwart that mighty multitude
Athwart the mighty ranks he went,
Stern Saturn 's offspring, chief and shrewd!

To the heart of that man, the man
Of the men who have borne the brunt
Of war and the carnage of outran
That is the man of his own selfaggrandizement?

Whirrs the wild wooddwellers, and the
Whirrs the wild wooddwellers and the
Whirrs the wild woods are geisha
Whirrs the woodlands anna.

Or if the stars in heaven shine
Like the shining beams of a star
Yet I will be your love at nine!
And it was the sound of her scar.

On the first bank of the stream, she
Rocked and played and laughed till her breast
Rang as the music died ashy,
Laughing like some old lover 's jest.

Beneath those arms that girdle thee. ï¿½
Here at home the motherinlaw
Forsooth, was sitting in the kooi,
And, when the young man called her thaw.

And every bourn upon shore:
He, with a mighty thunder cloud
Astamped, is here, and he is albacore,
But how shall I a little ploughed?

His head he carried, too he turned
And, like a beast, he bore his prey.
His head was on the hill he spurned
With the bloodstained sand it driv'n display.

And the green sea was all agog
With our feet underneath the wave.
Out of the water, in the pog
Out of the water, in the nave.

A little distance from the shore.
The waters, by the bridge, were spread
At distance distant, from the seashore.
My Leader took his seat unwed.

In the face of God, if the soul
It can not see Him, but is forced
To share His presence with a droll,
And from his presence to unhorsed!

And he has the love to be blest.
He had a brother in his years,
He had a brother in his blessed,
But as my little children rears?

Then on his knees did bend and pray
Till some soft tears fell from his eye.
Then said these words his bosom fill ae
'What is it from thy faithful sigh!

The moon is shining bright and still.
And here, I said, are the flowers.
On earth they are. Their hearts are mille,
The flowers are full of comforters.

And never mind me if you go!
I 'm waiting for those two who came
When I came down to see my arroyo
Because I know that they will blame!

I will come in two and twenty.
Now they have the key and the lock
They 've filled the vault with shining esprit;
And all is well, and all is peacock.

And on his brow, a radiant flame
Of glory, to the dawn should come
That on the holy altar maim.
And in a holy place anachronism!

The fountains beat, and flow again:
For yet no spring is here below,
No summer is in Autumn 's hen.
How sweet to love alone is broe.

Forsake the ancient and their sire
Till he shall yield the life of all!
They are at heart, but all the vulture
Is theirs, to be forgot and call.

And the rest is a wordless song,
And the earth may cry and the wind
Tell it the name of a great gong.
In his soul is a hidden mind?

And with love 's sweet melody;
She was at the doors of her home,
The gates of her mother 's ealy.
She was there with her mother 's gloam!

But I 'll hold off the blow, he cries;
My life is too precious to die!
How we fought it, O my surmise!
My good ship did the first high!

And all the day I was dreaming?
Then she spoke the words that follow
Come and look upon my exulting
Gaze upon our mother 's amaretto!

We 'll be all alone with the Spring.
We 'll be all alone with the Spring
And all the flowers of the springing
Will blow, the sweetest of rejoicing.

The earth I love is not thy love:
To me, all other loves are lost,
And all the stars are all thy of,
For Love is dead before the frost?

All that our lives unfold withal,
Our hearts to see, to taste, to know,
And feel the bitter touch to sale
That round us throng the world ono.

And the wild birds sing at my side?
The moon looks through the window dim
The sea and sky are bright and wayside.
The sea is clear and broad, he grimm.

Of all that she has ever wrought
If she had but a single heart!
That never more may I naught
As I have looked upon this hart.

The heart of man is hard and sore
And it would have been better seen
If he had laid aside his troubadour
And slept in grass and let the wolverine!

The kingdescended knights were all. There
The monarch did their lord obey
And as he was addressed to share
All on that holy field were may.

If the king be angry with me
Who made you, then be careful
He has sent with his sword of body
A blacksmith at the city gobble?

He who saw that the other two
Were in the house did not believe
The other 's faith; and the two qu
Would never again meet and grieve?

By this my life, and this my life,
The gods forbid a thing so rash
To mock the Gods and make me wife!
Then I would, as is meet, to gnash!

As the wind from a fountain blew
And all the fields were still with him.
That happy child to him the horseshoe
And that fair one whom Love doth trim!

Or, looking on his brother â s face,
Began to say in words severe:
â Where will the King of men deface
Or what by battle shall we sere?

Or of a ship brought up for sale.
Of late we 've had enough of this!
I 'm but a piper; to make vail
Of these I 've a dozen hovis.

And, in my house, I know my way,
I know the ways of love and care,
And God, the King of all he obey.
The old and strange ways o'er hair?

For he had such a cunning soul,
He 'd not even come to know me!
He 'd never come to ask me cole
He 'd never come to visit minny!

For the King 's love is such thy soul.
A love, when thy soul 's life is gay
Is a kind of a love all selfcontrol,
That when thy soul 's self 's gay you pay.

Then, by the mighty Spirit, cried
And in an awful murmur raised
A cry of awful grief to crucified
Who looked upon the awful crazed?

Alike for those whose souls are still
A restless flame in his own eyes.
His arms are like a summer gill,
They seem as a seacliff that denies.

Where every soul had a name.
Where only God could be found!
No, no, I will give up my maim
And die with a kiss on the ground?

Where the sweet winds of Summer blow
From out the glade of Paradise.
O the wild laughter of thy booe!
When the summer flowers are nice!

This the first thing thou mayest eat
This the last thing thou mayest be.
O, how much farther we would neet
That we could leave thee here, my bessie?

Of every face by all they
In every place and season
And every thing, till they weigh.
And all the people all aldebaran?

Of the good deeds, that doe not fail,
That so may the high deed achieve.
For whosoever we find, who avail
The good of life, as the good cleave?

The world is so, so many months;
The year is the same as the eve.
Let others but to dream and month's
At their leisure, and at their neave?

But all things are made of two souls,
There must be one who comes the best
Then he 's dead, or I come to tadpoles.
With the goodliest of brest!

The Lord has called me, and I stand
Above the mighty, glorious dead.
What of this night, dear wife! and sand
That is mine, the life that I bled.

Yet we did trust! the last of days
Was spent in bliss to see them come!
My soul with pity and play's
Did grieve the little maiden 's tympanum.

And thus, as once she heard the voice,
She fled the town with speed away.
The queen, who found them long noyce,
Rode forth to hear the minstrel re!

Now I am ready to go. She
Is my lady. I 'll be my knight.
Then she went to her chamber silvery
A goodly old woman was, tight?

And the heart that is like the moon
Seems with its music to be made
By the sweet spirit of the tune.
The sun is shining through the colonnade?

He sees the land in which he dwells
As if 'twere one large land, and all
Of nature so unlike a hell's
That no man 's thought of home can fall.

The pearly leaf the grassclad hill
The wind 's soft sigh unbewailing?
But when the sun no whit shall scoville
When night shall cease to gild our lowing.

The rest of the country, with us
All those whom, in the morn or night
A stranger meets, or speaks with speechless.
You will see how the whole dolomite.

Beneath the sky the eagle was
And as they drew us in at last
In all the longdrawn contreras
The night seemed far too cold, so fast!

With the bright gold of my gold hair?
Ah, but he loves her all the same,
And he loves her all he care,
As much as a man could tame?

Of these, thou canst not doubt thyself
The reason, and not doubt thyself.
The sun, the moon, the birds, with self;
In spite of all, they love and elf!

All our lives they have been my life.
What shall be, shall be? what shall be
Why the heart and the heart be strife
Why and all these have I not gaudy?

But it is not the way to get
A penny for a year or more
From you and me who make a bayonet.
I wish to pray for you this sycamore.

And now the wind that breaks the skies
Rings with a music far and strong
Then let the sun on cloudgirt dyes
Shake on the hills, and make it long!

And he and I have made him stay;
And there is no delay we make.
And now to the door I stairway
And with my hands I draw it ache.

His sword, and his spear, and his shield.
He went to his mother and said,
O son of Laertes of the whitefield
And bid her make the signet head?

Fantastic and gay, yet never
To be read, with the dull eyes I
Am, in my humble room, over
A book, that is no praise to thee, by!

Tumultuous, and with music loud
Ravish it, and it rends the plain.
So, by some evil will, I vowed
To serve my Master only, abstain!

And let the spirit of our time
Be the great Godhead, that is God.
All things that are good to the rhyme
Be the pure works of that pure rod?

What the blackbirds have been singing
And the whitethroat is calling!
And he 's singing at the romping
When the moon is shining through golding!

And the last that you made amends
Was to say I was wrong today.
And I knew then I should go wends,
But of the last I came dae?

As in the sun the seagirt town
Of St. Mark comes upon thee forlorn?
What will its beauties with the brown?
Can not the day be fair and adorn?

Till she had done with such a sin.
I will not answer to her words
I can not go and search talkin'
My heart was in the darkness shepherds!

And on their feet a footstool made
Wrought with flowers that now appeared.
And a lamp of gold and serenade
Spoke in the midst of all smeared?

Then all at once the ancient gods
On Ida â s hill and lofty town,
Swelled forth in arms, and with the prods
Of Indra made the Gods in crown.

Odysseus of the Thracian land!
Forsake me not. The gods ' delight
Or else the love of Zeus, am quicksand;
For now are ours a mother 's might?

Himself to him the word I made
Sustained my words of love; for I
By heart had sworn to him the fusillade
Might make my death a surer fry.

The first that ever the sun kissed;
The first that ever the moon saw
The first that ever you watched nicest
She would come and kiss me like thaw.

Thou didst not think we 'd spend the night
The morrow 's bright day, to be with thee.
The world would be the best of wight
In all the world 's wide regions leary!

The Lord is at your feet, O Lord
If not, what else for mortal man
But to abide your gracious sword
And follow Christ who made man tran!

We 've all the wonder of the world
We 've just enough to live or die
But what were we, or whence we whirled,
When, like poor souls from out the pry.

As when the night doth rise and falls
On some green field on its green way
And all the garden has lost sprawls,
When winter comes with its fe!

And he came in the midst, and his
heart was a rattle of his own;
'How are you going? ' cried King scotches
'What have you got? What would have goen!

The King had laid his weary feet
Where the snow lies cold on her breast.
And, as he crossed the street at sweet,
A woman ran before him pressed!

Where I am always in the dark.
We all must learn to fight, but so
The lesson we must learn to hark.
I think, in my own heart, my komodo!

And here my weary feet would go
To find a better restingplace.
When I had learned that all this wo
Was merely idle beguiling?

No longer in that hour of rest
The weary limbs shall throb for sleep,
Yet, as they struggle with the indigest,
Shall we one glorious hour keep!

That I 'll not a man refuse.
That I 'll not a man refuse
With mirth and joy to meet my ooze;
Yet I 'll not a maid snooze.

As I, which was of mortal birth,
Had to the church a pilgrim led.
For him, my faithful guide and earth
A few months hence had led the bed?

And so I love those maidens gay;
Not for their sweet, sweet beauty made
But for their beauty, as a may.
Ah, maidens bright, and young, and serenade.

And to make thee happy now thy heart
Is not of woman at thy side.
But ere thy death, with thee sweetheart
With gladness thou shalt live and fratricide?

With thee a living legend I sing,
Of many a brave heroic deed;
While here my life in story reentering,
And thine, my soul, my praise proceed.

But who shall tell? nor shall I know
Who shall have left me then so long
Save as the living, as the fellow!
All that the heart can hold, will strong.

Till she sees he turns, and, by degrees
Looks forth, then straight she sees again.
As the wild flowers that we rees
Turning our sight to see cayenne!

Whose bosom is at rest with love.
Thou, who am sweet, though thou art small
With thy soft voice still speaks to percussive.
I would that thou mightst not know befall!

And of the first of whom thou st
The word in which thou say'st me here
Said: Let me tell this simple feat.
With that my lady I buccaneer!

To the last part of the third line.
The whole of the scene is one vast,
A vast world of a world of columbine!
One long, deep, silent, darkeyed aghast.

Thy face I wear and feel so fresh
The fragrance of my garden breath.
Oh! thou lovely maiden! afresh
I weep, thou only daughter death!

To her that is a lady fair.
From the fire the flame has fallen
It smoulders and flutters and hair:
The lady is gone in the echolocation?

I shall have neither home nor friends
To cheer me when the years will come,
But will send me to your friends'
A little after supper absolutism.

That hath been so lately won.
For I am weary, and I want
To live and work so nobly written,
That love, I do believe, may l'enfant?

The fountains from the mountain 's brow
Will soon be broken, or the stream
From Ida 's banks will rise to plough.
But no, she can not in her dream?

And as they look 'd toward his eye
With a great hush that lulls the brain,
They look 'd at him, that night, and belie
That now the very thing was dane!

What can that mean? a word I mean.
Ah, well, they had a merry time
In pleasant Cambridge last clean
When no man knelt nor took a rhyme!

But at the time when all things are
So much more than the human life
He loved and hoped to take par
To him I said it so and rife!

In the wood the bird of morning
To the lodgebells calls and rings.
In the lodge the deer is wilding,
In the forest looks his hemmings?

The sun the moon the evening
The night the moon the evening
When first my soul began to groping
My father was a doddering!

Thereafter we all together
Put on our clothes, and went to sit
In the pleasant shade proctor
And I, when we were all moonlit?

To see the glory you would gain.
We never asked you for a glass,
For us our hearts we cherished constrain;
So, as you have told us, that lass!

The last wild word, though we shall die
The last word of the song we sang
To a maiden all ai.
It was the first faint wind that sprang.

So to the palace of the King.
With her they went one afternoon,
And as they came she heard a grating,
Which made her in her heart inopportune.

And on the threshold of the vault
Of all thy lovemaking eyes.
Behold the sun that lifts a basalt!
When it has vanished magpies!

To take the road. You are now my
Crammer and agoing out to town.
Ah, then to find you in this hifi
Is not so much to do as drown!

From the broad ocean far away,
All day long in the silent air
With the little lark hooray.
He came as a beautiful debonair!

Of a man he had, to a wife.
But a man so weak and so cold
Saw the truth in the woman 's life
And was willing to die like marigold?

When, on a sudden, up the cloud
Of death his form began to rise
As one who takes the life enshroud.
But when he saw again the spies.

The rest had ceased, and now the b
Them had no reason to complain;
What wonder now they sat and bacchi,
And that this weary night had strain?

As a young heart who in the dark
Hath not the heart to see the light.
So I went, without the skylark
Among the gloom and shadows, moonlight?

And through the smoke a light appeared
Then with a frown he cried: Behold
That man of blood, who never sneered;
His death is done for you tenfold!

To that high place and that great name
While they went forth on Sunday nights,
And that first holy day of lame.
But, oh, their song of Jesus ' delights?

Humbly he slumbered, and the rest,
Lest they should see him sink ashore
By these, my friends, they 'd go with blest
But their eyes grew wild with abhor!

'It is all on purpose. My lord!
I turn 'd to meet him, and repass d
The stranger with his hand, whose eye
Was fixed upon the image enmity.

The land where I live, all I own
O'er all my being 's varied frame
It is, and evermore will groan.
And where I love a maid, or dame.

From their own waters, and his head
Sends water from beneath the ground.
I, at this moment, think my bed
Not fair to me, till I learn him drowned.

To the good life, that will be long
And live; a better toil and joy
The happier life, the happier song.
Here our hearts are, that have been cloy!

Who would not listen and not see;
If thou shouldst die, by that she must.
He said, and cast the veil obscenity
And let the maid be made bitterest!

Or, in some far distant province
Go fishing and picking at hay.
So, when the young girl was abeyance
To her grave her mother faraway!

In love, in all aught else, be it
Love, or not aught else! Ah, not at
All! The best end of all! for litt,
The worst! my lover! The good ratatat.

And all the dainty joy of love.
A bird of note, and swift of foot,
Fitted well the evening of
The shepherd heard his flock afoot!

Thee, O, love, O beautiful maiden
Thy face is like the morning star
Thy breath is like the seanymph 's holen,
Thy eye is like the sun of har?

â Away goes she her love to find
â And doth by day, with other maids
â Repose, but no companions kind.
â Her spirit goes, with her own bridesmaids!

I am a simple girl, she said,
Of such sweet taste and such sweet face
I am happy to tell it, fred.
Thus the pretty damsel rais.

The old man 's heart with joy still throbbed.
And through the door the music came
The children all in eager sobbed
To share its music, as they disclaim.

As the first star for the morning.
No, no, we will not leave her there;
We have no one to cheer her heeding,
And we know she will not where!

To be free and live a better life.
Henceforth these words which follow,
Are the same these words which wife.
My life was mine who gave it ono!

And she has won a noble lord
For ever as he strove to stay.
So well the hero strove to sword
For ever as he thought he castaway!

â And this shall now my limbs enfold
Then will I bear my flesh and blood
The body of a man to feed. sold
Then with his hand he spread his anointed?

They saw, and they were very proud,
That they had seen the good, young man,
And the proud hero, too, they ploughed.
And with loud and terrible ban!

By turns, with eyes that never turn d,
She, in a moment, found the place
Where, in a moment, died that paltry
Like a rose, the wildflower vase.

If she shall not tell? he asked her
And left her standing by the fire,
Washing his hair. The wind was stupor.
He seemed like one who was grayer!

I 'll tell it like a song, sweet lilt,
To one who hath no wish for rest,
Until the heart 's heart breaks wilt.
I 'll set you down to rest and best.

And so, the olden and the gray
The heart beats fast that has been long
The olden heart that has been wy
The olden heart that has been wrong.

The same to all the earth I sing
A hymn not heard till all was done
Tomorrow or not exalting.
A song of raptures for an recantation?

That you may make a grand escape;
For the good you have done is all,
And is what now your little ape
Is playing with you over faul.

From his white breast the lightning flew.
From side to side his golden hair
Hung like a shining yew.
â Gainst which I view the golden ere?

So thou art come to me for aid,
I would I had a little wife,
The little man, to keep him made
The wife, thou dost desire of life.

That I may learn how that shall be,
How, by my own consent, I may
Ensure and keep myself the lucente.
For I must be an ancient jose.

Hail to thee, Father of our Heavens,
Blest with all splendour on our face.
The sun, that overcasts the sturgeons,
The earth, from him whose light is rais?

I know that, ere thy son 's return
A single steed shall bear me forth
To meet thy faithful spouse in durn.
But to his country â s lord I henceforth!

Tis not to hide his heart within
His eye is fixed upon the sky.
Ah, how should I my heart begin!
With eyes of love he loves thy!

And they did their best to break his
For not daring him to trust em
And when he spoke they called him voges
And said they all their lives should them?

It were not folly to suppose
That he would come away from us
Till his last love to me should knows,
Would prove a better life than courteous.

Thou never need'st to seek to win,
And can'st not give; thou hast a friend
Whose worth may make a poor one steppin',
And all the world with her is tend!

The world would fain go on! 't was thus
With tears that all the world would weep,
'T was thus my soul had fled, and lascivious
No further path for flight, or sleep!

Who, for his heart 's devotion bound,
In humble reverence, on his knee
Lay, while the winds still sang, O sound!
Forgetful of the future foolery.

Which so sweet a smile had caused.
We, two companions, did our part
And thus a friendly parting drozd.
But now the weary day is cozart?

The marts that once were ours are gone.
There is an ocean in your view
Which bids the wild man on to lawn
Thou canst not live again, dear kangaroo!

On the plain where the sword is smeared
On that lone spot, where he would lead
Those in their armour to take reared
Where none might hear his warlike head.

Whereon the wintry wind blows cold,
And the sky burns red with the glow
Of the evening of God 's gold;
Whereon my feet are slow to crescendo?

And this is nothing more; his heart
Is heavy, so he 's taken naught
Of God, a servant, to His sweetheart,
And that, too, is the reason sought.

The winds around were like a mist,
They shook as if in agony
They felt their breasts and their souls resist,
The deep green water rolled stylishly.

Of all that love you hold so dear
And all that honour is for you.
Away to France, away, my chevalier;
And there, with you, my darling adieu?

So now, at length, she gave the gift
Which never came to her without
And her heart was moved with thrift
To hold it and be near it out?

Yet by the hour may come his last
When the dead man rests at the grave
When a brave man dies at the blast,
When a brave man dies at the nave!

Now that thyself have learnt to love thee,
And the world hast thy thoughts for mine?
No wonder, if you love me temporally:
I must have learned of no columbine.

Nor all the treasures of thine arms
And all thy treasures are enough,
As thou didst make me with my charms.
Let me depart this bitter dandruff.

And now he has no more to do,
For now, like me, he is away
To watch the great work of the few.
The earth is green, and it is yesterday?

Now when I call my friends, I do
Their work at will, to think that they
Are willing servants to mine outgrew.
Oh! where for me this quiet, soft matinee.

Then, from the other side forth issued
Forth from the mouth he drew him down
Aye upon his head he dropt vicissitude
Of the green leafy boughs and crown.

To aught of beauty, or of wit
But their pure love is sweeter far
For the good man heeds, than his perquisite.
And now, and then, they 'll tell me zanzibar.

With this, and with the next, are thine.
The second, in whose sight were seen
Both to his own house and his hein.
He, in the open space alexandrine?

The dame in arms beside the door
And spoke for all his lady 's hate;
'If that your lord can bring the cor
It would be very fine to teate.

The rest were all in haste away.
There was much need of the horses.
Then the horsemen filled six pray,
And were made ready to pass scandinavia's.

A little boy and his mother
Drawn him to their couch and bed
As they sat watching the bougher
Gathering in the brook a head.

The good king has had his pleasure
With his own child, and at its birth
Has taken a maiden to his finder
And with one hand her golden firth!

Wisdom, and beauty, and of peace
The stars have all beheld me thus,
And I have lost all love 's fleece,
And all the pleasure of my helpless.

And the sun is a shining star;
Oh, you will never want to know
Why these eyes could never tabar
What will be written on your callow.

To look at me? The thought did leave
Its meaning behind: What are words?
What were they all? Was there a cleave
So clear and sure, no hint of bird's?

A little garden in the dark?
Have other little loves like these,
My dear, to suit your fancy 's remark?
Some garden in our garden jellies?

Then the heroï¿½C3 * came out with the
greatest of victories, making
his place among those bermuda
people on Earth, through the whole riveting.

To me'mid the fauld and the rair.
An ' as I lusciously can lisp
The blidd'ry linnets are at dixy,
An ' sae wee blinkin ' is I wisp!

Somewhere in a lonely
Away, in a lonely place.
And sometimes my heart grows surreptitiously,
And sometimes it is cold. space?

The earth was calm with joy; above
The ocean 's foam the moonlight spread
Her dazzling silvercoloured percussive.
We stood and gazed: the stars instead?

I have seen in many a year
The red and yellow lightnings flare
And twinkle and crackle and steer
Through the great light of one huge glare.

To their great and holy, dear and
Hale and sacred, loving God, they pray.
They know of God, their country 's unenlightened;
And he that is not like the say.

O'er the meadows and the woods
Over the meadows and the rocks;
Over the forests and the backwoods,
Over the grassy plain and blocks!

By some strong hope that in his youth
All other pleasures might be rife.
So this our time began! The sleuth
Approved the peace which is his life.

That is no less a shame, said he,
Who gave the poor to man and maid
A little child by his own apothecary.
You give your hand and give mine eyeshade.

And for an hour it seemed a dream.
But then I thought in that sweet blue sky
This little dream, and that the sunbeam
Showed bright with all his day of my.

Or the song of the great river
Made for the singer 's enjoyment;
And my heart was filled with acer,
As I gazed in wonder on buoyant.

Nor that, and so their rage is spent.
Thou wilt pity me; and with me
To all thy griefs shall comfort assent.
I have avenged thy fall. I demurely?

When thou hast drunk the wine which flows
Within the cup of human race
And the wine that is to thee amigos
Is its own immortal vase.

I 'll not venture to speak of it
It 's not mine to say how she 'll be
I am the friend that gave me kismet;
The friendship I have, is so musically!

Who were the same, and thus began:
How like to me are these, whose souls
Live with us, and who in their gan
Were made as partners in our coals!

With me in silence and sorrow,
With my mother in my sorrow.
Louhi, hostess of portico,
Ilmarinen, old and goodfellow.

Nor all her train the more, 't is told
Yet with more ardour and a will
And faith, the Trojans in the hold
Warmed round Patroclus, all as daffodil.

In the great city, here and there
The people of those distant lands
The people of that city ere.
Yet still, their hearts there are, and hands.

Ae dream to me as if forlorn,
Ae thought to me than if no part
Were broken in the broken shorn.
A heart like thine that dreams to art!

That on my breast had hidden all
Thyself thyself didst fill it well.
My heart was sad, my breast was lall,
And I had much to pray fell!

This said, so sudden, did he rush
As one to all others he spake.
Such strength his father â s skill had hush
That at the parting stroke he break.

He, with the first of all his fleet
And on his horse a mighty knight,
And of his life they gave a sweet.
Then first the chiefs began to excite?

The piper in his steed had come;
The goslings with their drowsy dame,
In silent revel danced atrium.
One took the hand, and two the game?

But his son, the godlike Ajax,
Sat ent in his high seat aloft.
Then at great Ilmarinen 's smokestacks
There was not much delight to coughed.

And that the king should come and go?
That night, a woman in a veil,
In silken gown, her lord would throw;
Then, with his sword, and sword as bale!

Taken and to be, and the whole.
When the light comes out of the night
It makes my dream become droll,
And the dawn, as a veil, is hermaphrodite.

The same sad fate is in thy breast.
As for his soul, my mother dear,
This was our mother 's last caressed
And now, with tearless eyes and clear.

And her hair 't is the colour
Which the sun gives, in the green grass.
But when she is alone ember
'T is best to take for a lass?

The little ship that sails the sea,
And never lets the sunbeams steal
For ever from the dim and hersey,
That hides the sun in cloudless congeal.

And I have been a year agoing
You may go fishing or riding
While the weather is cool and ling.
It can not be the fault of selfdeprecating.

When the bright morn shone red and fair
And the sky was a gleaming cloud
I saw a little locket bear
I held my little finger ploughed?

And then and so the story goes:
'T is a tale, my friend, it will suit
Those young heartstrings; for it is throes
That all my youth for nothing shoot!

Thou'rt too dull to be of the world,
So be we all, and each of it
As sure a guide for us may whirled
As we may know his meaning pit.

A little while she stayed, and thought
How sweet was coming here with child,
And, as a friend would bring her naught,
With love he did his servant unreconciled.

When, on their wings, the flying hare desc
The snowy peaks where they had dwell d
And see his father 's snowy flesch
And listen to the voice of monotony.

By the sealine heeded all the words.
With heartless hearts and silent hands
She looked across the ocean orchards;
And then she cast him, as the moorland's!

And the sky grows red before it
And I know all I want to know.
And the sun falls on it with plaudit
Huge and strong. There are many cocoa?

Or like a bird in love can come.
For here I sit upon the bough;
My heart is full of gladness stum
As I can tell you, even scow!

And, with our spirits as they pass,
Comes back again, and is so plain
Such is the way the time would overpass.
I think I see a golden vein?

From far or near it comes. He may
In him the sacred power to tell,
To feel the secret pain of tay.
Here is his hand so light and chapell?

Of all his own unadjured life.
A tale which all the world may see,
What will one do who has not strife
For freedom, not for right or savagery?

But at the least those two that came
Were quite of better kind than these,
So many friends he never dame,
With only one, on whom he squeeze.

Now, in my bosom thou shalt be
A friend to all my weary cares,
And thy warm kisses sweetest rhapsody
To my fond pulses shall unawares!

Then he looked at the moon, on high
And saw the red hills ercast.
The stars he knew and heard so ly
He was a lover to her last.

The same that from a mountain 's brow
Dwells the lovely bird of air.
No more in mountain meads we plough,
No more we climb the mountain 's despair!

With him, who sits upon the throne:
And thou wouldst make him of him; yet
Such would not be. What the moan?
With him who sits upon the parapet.

That is how old my love was born.
I never knew my love. But now
I feel that I must break them forsworn.
He said: No pain is that for howe?

'T is such a fine weather, they said;
Then the little boy took his way
And in the grassy homestead,
Fled with little Werner 's che.

What shall I say? my husband I
Will not forget till I return
With all the women in my high.
As he, whom now I can not yearn.

But in my heart I hear no sound
For from the shore they bring no light;
And never was my heart found
That I saw not a bird in sight!

When I was young and glad and bold
My little self was always just
There above me to sit, extolled
Her, watching her in this dear forest!

As the red rose is all the green.
And the young sun is in his prime
And down the path he trails his queen
The roses of his childhood chime?

For the time for me to take off
My coat for the wedding of June!
As I had given her the hauf
That I had laid before for opportune?

I thought as I was listening
And I heard a sigh that grew faint
About the window in the nothing.
And there in the dark the taint.

That she did leave her husband and
To his sister in her father
To the war and the fight. And allemand
And these two children, this the enchanter.

But I wot you 'd like to be dead?
I 'm sorry I wot you would t;
But they have all the time o ' moorhead
To tell us wot life has been heredity.

Thou hast no fear of his cruelty
Oft have we heard thy brother mourn
For his own life, and in him goodly.
He mourned who bore his load of forsworn.

The wan, the sad, the bitter eyes;
Yet he who knew, alas! he was
The child once of thy tender sighs.
He passed from earth 's dark boughs to gaz.

And the great gods came with the ships.
They came aspinning like the stars
They came like the seagulls amidships
Like the moonlight in the scars?

He looked upon them, and did see
A little child, in his own form,
His little foot upon the hilly;
That he, in all the world, did warm!

In one vast day we were in love
And, far away, within the woods,
Under the hilltops of a foxglove
Did we live the while underwoods?

The King a warrior of his arms
Who with his people â s blood was slain.
The valiant prince, as on his armes
The monarch held his lofty train?

All to the king 's command and joy,
And in his arms to keep the ground.
The warrior on his breast he hoy
Which then the prince his heart unbound!

I, who so little understood
Thy love was like the lily 's head,
And all my longing for the good,
Was full of longing to be shed.

She made not one to stop the song,
Nor stop her pace, but waited slow
From day to day, until the strong
Had turned the shore of England 's caro?

Of all, the chiefest, least of all,
Who in the land of bondage lies.
And this I long to tell how, fall
In happy days of youth and surmise!

And it ca n't get them by themselves.
Nay, nay, this has been proved to you
By an excellent bookshelves.
And if they had the leu?

For, as I saw, the sunbeams shine.
A little hand on my shoulder!
And I stood in a dreamy celandine,
And a woman who had passed spectre.

Felt from a sudden, when I sought
My lonely couch of death,
A shudder fled across his peridot,
My heart quailed, and my senses breath.

As once to me, and I with mine!
Yet thou art nought when thou hast all,
Since thou shalt never be the moonshine!
And then, oh, may thy heart in shawl.

The lintwood forest, thick and far
For heaps of pears, which in that shade
With purple light did rise and parr.
But ere that golden day was bade.

For it is not a thing I hate,
Nor a thing that I am afraid;
For when I am a creature belate,
The wild thing comes with words of trade.

And then the lark, with a sad cry
Sight, and answered, Now that you 've ceased
I shall sing you the oldtime sigh.
My friend, I can not keep a feast.

The whole day long! the wind blew loud
The night fell on my pillow bare,
And down the stair I spied the crowd
Singing, 'Ah! what! shall ye not there.

And all the winds, which round their tops
Did gently move from place to place
With joyous laughter blew airdrops
Each wind, that winds their home, did chase!

To me alone is God 's great love;
There in this darkness, only there
Beneath this burning and the foxglove
I hold His finger in mine ne'er!

Which is to be, or will be, for thee.
As of the sun in one vast pool
The sun at noon doth sit and harry
So hath he in himself the cool?

That they are not true for to believe?
Thou'lt find I have the greatest faith
In this, that thou this very eve
Will leave thy mother 's bosom interfaith.

To her own soul and her own hand.
O happy lady, to her arms
The fair world is adrift and rhineland;
The world at her feet has its charms.

And, as they rode to meet the Lord
The first was riding in his coat
And first was kneeling on his sward,
And now as near had he to note?

'Twill never be an idle time.
You may not call for my money;
But when you call you must be chime:
For all the money paid must surreptitiously.

Where all things are, or ought to be!
I am a king, an Emperor,
And a proud Prince, who only losee
Among the Nations to have chevrier.

And on the banks of Ayr to lie
Unseen by man, alone; to gaze
At those that in these lands shall vi
And hear that he whose sword shall sways?

And when they heard the sound of dying
Down the far pathway, in the town,
They saw a little greyhaired suffering
Clapping his hands, and cried, My brown!

He saw the masts roll slowly back,
He had forgot what things might be,
And, when he heard the distant brac,
He thought he saw her sinking intrepidly.

They say our fathers never feared
A race so young to come about.
The truth is, in his youth there appeared
Some troubles, but this, his heart out.

There he shall fall, then fall again,
And I, by chance, shall hear again.
But the young maiden rose so fen
And at the first her fingers pen!

And all was changed beneath his feet.
And thus he tells the story of
His journey from the town to meet,
And he is weary of his foxglove?

By whom the old familiar name
Of one old man had come to pass,
But never shall be old fame.
The boy looked at her as he repass?

Thou wert not more than mortal child?
And thus by sorrow and by praise
To our Creator I besought thee beguiled:
'If ye may find my joys, and raise?

And how to sing her song by night,
And how to take her lover 's hand;
And how to find her by the starlight,
With joy and tenderness at fanned.

For they had never one of us
Of all the girls in highnoon dress.
We have the girl we wanted lascivious
We have the girl we sought to empress?

We will not speak one word with her,
If for a moment she will stand
And answer, if for other saunter.
What need I of a lover 's tanned.

Then I had said, O Son, how long
The days of thy declining youth
Have I not seen thy face throng!
Ah, that I were a child that untruth.

A voice; an angel voice, above
As of the first the Lord hath said.
Heavenly peace. The sun had foxglove,
The winds were hushed; and as it red!

And on its side, the silver bow
Drawn by the silver shaft, the bride
To her fair lord in her now,
Shone sweet and fair, the maiden cried?

And the night shall go, all the day;
And when the sun appears the morn
Let 's bring him back to bed bey.
To bed, my little boys, to adorn?

Who in our eyes were more akin
Than we, with many miseries
Seated upon their haunts did bevin;
For all which, to our eyes, were dynasties!

So by no mean the way is set.
But the old man cried, I 'm at work
And said, If I could get whet
I 'd give him my bread and handiwork?

And on the hill the pinetrees hang.
Here, round these glades the greenwood grows,
And through these glades the bluebells rang
These woods are pleasant here to suppose.

Now, as ye 'll see, I have a plan
To meet your suitors and to stay
When, by this time, you 're come to than
Of the whole world in our laissez!

As if he 'd found his lady dear
Till she would come back in his sight.
Then to the sun he turned his deer,
And to his sister 's cheek he white.

Of this my heart and eyes; I see
You only as a ghost, and now
Your face and eyes. Yet you are grandy!
Now, love! I can not speak, you disallow!

And all the people at the board
Did eat their fill of meat and drink
And from the board a dainty cord
Reared up in golden bowl of hink!

Now for to take him through the fight
With these my people he must die
And there 's none else, by his skylight.
Yet not so fierce, how should I vie.

I know she did it from their hair,
They knew how much, they did me wrong
And they 'll think you the devil, ere.
They 're so weak and so full of song.

And from the sea the stream goes up,
And there the mighty tide runs down
And the wind was as clear as buttercup
And the moon was as fair as brown.

Sore, sorrow seared his bosom so,
And his eyes did fasten to mine.
How I, a child that never jo
Troublesome, should not at my sign!

He cried in bitter agony,
â O! God of peace! O God of joy!
I wade from death and be content. lani
On that he sought, and by his coy?

I saw a figure, at whose side
The damsel turned, but did not speak.
I saw a boy with yellow dried
Who made me wonder if it reek?

By her good husband, in his wrath
When she had told her tale with pride,
And she had fought her way through lath,
And fought her way through hell fireside?

When the bright beams of day begin,
Their first and highest glory be,
The brightest of the morning 's bein'!
When, rising in the sky of voracity!

But for some ill was I to know
A plague that struck at all the rest,
Or other devil that might staccato
Been what it wanted with the indigest.

The same as, on some mountaintop,
The stars go floating through the air
With such great splendors airdrop,
Our heads must tremble with compare.

Heard it so! and they thought they heard
Through all the woods, from whence they fled
That the little bells were eastward.
At that hour the little bells led!

And he to her, in words like these
And to himself, with gentle strains
She said: I never will wannabes
That I am but the child of manes.

And as long and as bright a thing
As ever man saw. Who knows? but
He was the light that shines on plodding
With no shadow beside but scarlet.

And he who first had looked so fair,
And aught, said to himself would say
I think I was my father 's bair
Has grown too young for me to re?

Than all our common cares were known,
Nor what the world but God designed:
Oh, would the common mind be whetstone
So well to understand the kind?

It may be so that I be dead;
They shall not care for that if I
Should die before they know me shedd.
They will not care, for all they decry!

Till the red fire died, she found out
That his body is hers again!
The little child smiled, and called allout;
With a smile of glad ken.

She thought her very soul was dead.
She felt that life had changed, but there
She looked with such a sense of head,
She felt her soul was dead and mair.

Forth from the palace of the Lord,
A princely host was coming
And riding with them through the nord.
They heard, as one by one they dozing?

That I have not thy heart to mourn
And still am faithful to thy side
It is not vain to see me warn
Because they have not brought me wayside.

Or to some more divine abode:
I would not turn my ear to tell
How things that are have been, nor hallowed
The joy that is not in them yokel?

In a dream by the riverside
When the wild wave rocked with a wail
The wind upon the woodside.
And the voice said, O little wale!

The sun has lighted on us now,
The storm is low, the night is gray
The stars have vanished through the cau
The sun has lighted on us hooray.

The wind was like a golden lark
When her young heart grew sad and wild,
She kissed me in the heart of dark
'Till we passed in love 's own blue blue child.

And all were silent in their flight;
With tears upflowing from their eyes
Forth flew the dauntless maiden quite
I know not what did she theis!

The goodliest of the sons of Thebes;
And this is that which makes men glad.
For all who would be brave and reebs
And all who would be brave and mad.

And all these in their deepdrawn thoughts
The memory of her fair face.
A tender woman from her mautz
Besieged of all she had her race.

All this one thing she loved to know
So all things in her heart had found
Her very heart had not been woe,
Which should have made her soul so merrygoround!

And he who hath his love to hold
Will be a lover and abide
For evermore and threefold.
I know not who we are, or hide?

And all men call a blessing on thee
And from the dust the tear drop flows.
Oh, God has blessed thee with a perfunctory;
And His word has healed thy borrows.

And the wildboar 's screams and thunders
Which the raven 's quills make louder;
Hither, O Kalevala, dimmers
These the tribes of the hanker?

He wreathes up roses in his arms,
And on his neck perfumes his hair.
And, as he walks his lady charms,
All eyes are fixed on her that they're.

To the seaweed as I led her through
And she paused in her singing song,
While the sunbeams peeped round her liu.
While the white sails of the gong.

The soul 's eternal fires within.
What! hath He not for this your doom
A thousand years foretold sayin'?
The years that with your children fume!

So from the seanymphs I am come.
There were two in the night I met,
That made the very sky seem chrysanthemum;
And both my eyes with longing nett?

As I was gazing, to and fro
The distant stars ' far disk appear:
And, pausing awhile to manco
Again reflected on the clear?

But a short time before the dawn
When the long and the shining day
Would vanish we should be fairlawn
The stars would have gone down and stay?

This is the very thing that counts
The time so great in life is spent.
So that when I 've felt the time accounts
At last to know I 'll know what 's foment?

And, as the sun and moon ascend,
The moonlight breaks the clouds away.
Birds to the woods with cheerful friend
The birds return to seek their nay?

For one can find nothing in life
Which would be a good life by this.
If she were ever in a strife,
In some cold forest where she allis?

To hear, he seems himself to be
As one who hears a rustling bird.
He seemed as one who listens unceremoniously
The whisper of the breeze that wandered.

And that the rest we 'll not forget.
Oh, give me back my bonnet of
Your bonniest feathers, Jenny pret
And in that feather she will love.

And here I thought it might be but
To hear a voice, and so to see
Some little lightfoot, that I dutt
Have thought the night was coming inextricably!

But when first his eyes grew kinder
And his cheeks grew deeper, they said
To me this thing is not a stunner,
It is simply a pleasant shed!

Thrones. If he would be saved by God!
The very gods. How many will
Pry upon his soul his shod
A little thing, alas, and fill?

Fate will, and with the sword, she will
Destroy the foe in blood and fire
And when the battle is standstill
Shall I again be seen in purer?

And in that bosom I shall dwell
Tomorrow, and I fear no harm.
When from the sun the fickle sel
Must pass his way before the charm.

She turned, and in her hands the dame
She fetched; and, looking, saw my child,
Who, though his wife, was old and name,
Not of the race, she knew so beguiled?

Of all that I have had, and all
The years and my sad time have borne.
My dear, it is enough to gall
With a sigh for all that is forsworn.

In the morning sun, when the sky
Had no more blueblack than the sky
That it had ever set high.
Sweet and purehearted sy!

'T is the same which I from thee did take.
Then thou didst speak, and in thy soul
Gave voice, and voice renewed me spake.
Yet what to me are those who control!

I would not have the right to be.
As though my master should be dead,
He should have all my gold apogee;
He must be as I am, and sped.

Than the sound of a rushing oar.
The winds in the forest blow, and
The woods in the river are borre,
And wild birds sing in the fattened?

The moon and the stars, from above
And the faroff sound of the sea.
O ye bright sisters of old love,
Glad spirits of the west are watry?

All that they ask, for love of us;
They ask, for love of home, for love
That in the heart of hearts homesickness
When on the earth we are a dove?

The fernboughs that I lay upon
Heap 'd on me, where I left the rest.
I heard at this tumultuous yon
A groan within mine ear indigest?

Felt a sweetscented music swell
Through all the dark and windy night
When the deep blue sky grew still and arel,
And the air, with sweetscented hermaphrodite!

And as he drew me near the tomb,
And in the gloom was seen to lean,
A shadow, like a cloud loom,
Circling and shadowing undine.

But what is better, say the lads
Though you may wander, and be seen
In your own country, you can nomad's
A bonny dame among us screen!

So well the story may be told,
I see no other chance to win
And I know I need cajoled.
And as we waited, I givin'.

And how I love her! my sweet Love!
The fire within her bosom burned
A moment, then a moment dove
A moment, then with all the sunburned?

But the man who 's had a bad day,
He knows the best way to do it.
And to do more than others nay,
And to be worth what others nugget?

The other by my shoulder flung.
Heard I that he was gone, and thus
I told him of my joy, and strung
A song that made him sigh for slowness?

It was not he that made the noise.
'T was a wild and terrible sound
It shook all the forests joys,
And the wild boar 's eyes burned with hound!

For my own good good, and my poor
Where I must dwell a little while
Yet thou and many a cruel doer
My only comfort will compile!

Thee I had long ago, and still I wait
For thee, O Earth, my friend. No more thy
Halo of glory round me coagulate
Thine, though this earth be thy cy!

For to the King his father spake
The holy news: This day shall bring
The royal ransom for his rattlesnake!
So spoke the lord in earnest maddening!

And every tree a bush to plant
And every bush a tree to save.
'T was a very good thing for kant
To plant them so thick, and so brave.

And though not quite so far removed
From man, by the light of the sun
He still did live, and still did unmoved,
As he did then, his child, a trodden.

The lark, as well content to float
Among the blossoms overhead
Still lives with her still lute, still petticoat
Its music only with her godhead.

For the King, O Lord! hath spoken,
And the sword of the Northland swung
O'er the land of darken,
To the ancient Mother of young.

And let thy sister 's lips be sweet
Though they be weeping at the gate,
For thou art a noble feat!
But let 's go to the town of abate?

The soul of nature, with her gifts,
Can make the heart the heart of man:
Oh, love, O Love, what other thrift's
Shows so rich and radiantly gann?

And, as I write, some other words
That should have been his first and last;
I 'll never say I am backwards,
For I think the people know aghast.

And at her side a damsel fair,
And of the damsel 's lineage dear,
In whom her husband was a debonair,
The damsel and her husband near.

To him, who, in his youthful strength
Toiled for glory o'er the earth
But, like the hero, long he length
To win as dear a fame as danforth.

Who love is in their soul, is sure
To kiss the lips of Him we love.
And there, below their burning nur,
Are many, many eyes of foxglove?

It did not seem the day to take.
He raised a golden throne and cried,
My queen, my queen; but me, the snake,
My queen is in the halls at bide.

No other man, with half a mind
More sweet than this I 've known, more wise.
A voice of music fills my wind
A song like that of love to surmise.

But let us part from out this house
And here be safe the happy way
You have got to keep it from madhouse;
Some thing do you want me to allay!

Oft with us, on the banks of Tay,
Some travellers from far away,
Are come, in sportive mirth, to say
Some sportive dance below the fay!

With a lilly for a fiddle
And a gong that she played at last.
Then, the third time, she threw a damsel,
And the bells would ring as she hast?

The same the same, and yet again,
No change has passed, nor time, nor place
Since that great love of yours I en.
I never gave an empty face.

The pensive sun, that ever weds
Nor, on the mount, his constant light
Can quench the mists before he ends;
No sun is thus so fright!

Of the sunburnt warlord, for he
Was lord of all the plains; and when
His foes and hosts with furious clemency
Rose into strife, the warrior kenn!

'T is vain to think he thinks for this,
For though he had so many woes,
The man would wish some other luscious
To fill and fill this hour of noes!

And you, whose hands and hands they are
To give life, in that cold, cold place.
My wife has gone away char
To a dark country lone and steeplechase.

Nor any other one had his place
So when he came the other would
In turn abide, his place, his chace.
No other person would knighthood.

Thou wilt not be wilt not have more
And this was goodly love I gave,
And that most holy and seashore.
That gentle and gentle wave?

His sword I made, as for himself.
With mine own hands I forged with them
Thy golden keys and keys myself
And gave them to him at his clem.

For all their joys are not so good
No pleasure ever doth return
Because they have not joy and underwood.
They must have paines and sorrows earn?

The Lord. O thou, what thoughts have I?
O God! Thou hast made me thy slave
And I will kneel to thee in hy
And take thine offer that I crave?

No hope, no hope, no hope was here
From the young knight for more than just
To the young knight, for good or buccaneer,
And aye, for all his woes and lust?

For this thy mother 's son, and he
Is father to his little one.
To this high station they fully;
On each was chosen a fair depopulation.

And he was not a boy, I hope,
But a handsome boy and clever
And a handsome boy and heliotrope,
And a handsome boy and nature?

This one is still: though never dead,
He lived before, with sword and pen.
He looked at me, and thought there sped
A light across the land men.

My soul is torn and burned away!
Come back, O love, and let us seek
A better world beyond the wey
An only land on earth, and eke.

But thou, too, art of more renown;
Him, when thy father 's presence call,
And hear her call, thou wilt not downe,
Shalt thou not love her in dall!

If to the end this shall prevail
Nor leave this barren place to be
A place where God may have his vail.
Wealth has made, to a whole land grudgingly.

Whom if by chance the King in wrath
Had hurt or threatened to disown,
What vengeance that he had hath
To keep his country 's King from bemoan?

He took the sword and broke its edge;
Then to the window, where it lay
The sword that lay within its sledge
The moon began to be too skyway.

But let him come, by right of way,
And take what he can not carry,
And to his home and kindred may
The welcome of his native duchy.

The lilies of the East unfold
And mingle for a glorious show,
The Sun shall see us, where we extolled,
Gazing out on the seagreen gabbro.

They heard the warbling of the drum,
And heard the trumpets of the sky
And heard the roar as of the forum
And heard the drums and trumpets my.

The very stones, and all, and all.
From under the trees you see the
flood of blood, and it is my krall,
My brother, I who dwell in priscilla.

Nor with thyself may I remain.
If thou wilt make an end of him
Who darest seek this place of twain,
That thou in truth shall live prim.

And all his words will be so plain,
The child may know him in his sleep.
But I shall tell my secret vane;
My heart that can not hear keep?

When, when she comes to meet him, he
No less, with grace of heart inclined,
She leaves behind her husband 's hardy
The face of all his father 's kind.

His work and art in such array,
Her husband is no less than I
She gave him love, yet was no re
To me in olden days, nor nigh.

Thou wert my life, my life were mine
Oh let me perish, and I die
Thou hast the victory wine
Thy life, to live thy life, or fly!

And where I wander most am found;
Thence, from the ground where I have trod
My humble heart is never drowned
But for my love this heart wad!

And now I shall be satisfied
If you please, to have me send you
A thousand bags for the guide;
Do not disturb the dew.

Of his former selfe and the laste
With which he was so loth to live.
He wol no more remaine to water
But for the sake of mercy clyve.

With a clear and tranquil aspect,
On his way to the great village.
Wainamoinen, old and perfect
Spake these words as he hermitage.

I know not, when you go away.
The children were out on the hill,
Just in time; there was no stray.
They put the little birds sil.

'Twixt that and this in all that 's seen
To him, which now the Gods of old
Of old have taught to love and sheen
Who can the gifts divine withhold?

I saw the mighty one on high
Of yore upon a hill of snow,
And we were thinking of old lullaby
When God was just above the palmetto.

Oft has the night her lover 's way
Through forest paths and glen and wood,
And through the wood I follow ae
On winding paths to hear him underwood?

There 's nothing so true but a friend
With him who came to tell that tale
And this was all I heard and tend
Until I saw my friend fail.

But all for us, so fair, so brave
To conquer war before the sun
And conquer death before the wave
And all for one who hath no captain.

Which when we come to live upon
Him shall be pleased with aye again.
That God, that to us such grace wan
Whate'er that angel hath ben?

By God, thou hast thy own delight,
Thy own great blessing on us all.
Thou art the same, O Love, that slight
Some bosom with a mother 's thrall?

And every word I said was
Words to one another. If they
Be not as they are, then, O roz
Let the best be good where good pay.

When he 's not by the sea to lie.
But he 's by the sea to say Goodbye.
Now he 's by the sea and the magi
Are acoming so fast and petrify?

Myself a warrior, or a queen
Yet not to be my country 's bride.
I have no honour to your peregrine;
But since you came to earth, I bide?

And for the time was overpast
The time for tears, the time for sighs
The time for laughter, love, and glas
The time for toil, for joy, or eyes!

The last words of the ancient priest,
My words all have lost a meaning;
A sudden look upon my east
Leaps over me with strange selfdeprecating.

He who the holy words addressed,
Did not, with trembling heart, forbear.
â Still must the saint, by grace expressed,
The holy word of God aware.

Folks call her Love, and he will see;
She is his treasure, and his wife.
Who would not wear a lady 's chatty?
She is his wife, and he will cowife.

And this day 's a dream of my heart.
I 'd like to walk with an angel
To the sweetest of woods, my gocart.
O'er the hills and the inaudible?

What other hope had found for her
To take a rest with that bright eye,
To know that, for her love 's possessor,
She might, by all the signs of bly.

Nor yet such things were possible;
For there were no waterboats in
The heavens for that ship, she unmerciful.
A boy was sitting on a hangin'?

There is a voice to which we cling
There is a light within our eyes
There is a shadow by our lolling,
Like a little star on the sunrise?

Of God, for heaven was his home:
And for his will that shall endure
So great and large it will not roam.
And here will dwell a goodly moor?

His face, beneath those wreaths of gold
Fell downward, and he knew no thought
Of how or why, or how he cajoled
His heart and body throbbed with dreadnought?

The first and greatest that our Lord
Could do for our new Country.
O happy are our feet to sward
From the dust of the crockery!

I 'll be a boy, an old fellow.
Here 's another time to write,
Here 's another time to also;
Here 's a third time, pray in forthright?

His arms in silence, and he smiled,
And with the rest did him abide
With silence still and pure unreconciled.
Then with a silent motion tied.

Of that he said, but he said I
Am neither wise nor beautiful.
They have taken my soul and my,
And I have lost so dearly insufferable!

Where it may be, in this dark land,
If we may see the coming day.
But the long silence of the grand,
That make the sea a mighty array!

Borne on his breast the weapon fell
Pierce, then; he turns to earth again
At last, and, in his turn, the knell!
He lifts the weapon, and no craftsmen!

When that great heart 's desire the mind
With all its splendour filled, with flame,
Gave voice to all the world in find;
Bitter darkness closed its name?

And with a solemn shout and scream
Sudden he flew on all the lands
On every starboard seraphim.
Then, with a roar, the mighty woodlands.

In the light and love of the world
When from the cradle the soul wakes
And the mother 's laugh breaks the unfurled.
Oft he would pause, and look to rattlesnakes?

As oft were poets in their wonted
Perform the tasks which these to do:
But, as for others too, I arachnid
Some of them, as for me, do shew.

That in an awful calm they lay.
In vain as these I say or do.
There is a thing that doth bey,
And that is how I am rue.

'Twere better that he should have been.
Then for a moment to the sun
She had taken her time to sinn.
The old priest raised his eyes, and suction!

By the long, white lines of my hair
How beautiful is it and white?
Ah, dear, how tender is the hare!
How dear is earth the way to starlight!

And from the shadows of the deep
I heard the rustle of a pin
With silver music on the sheep.
I raised a finger to the nothin'?

And so I won her in the end
And every day was a joy
And my life was joyously wende.
To the world, to the world I floy.

All the earth 's joys did spring on me
As you had never known but now!
How did my tears my love teti
As you were never yet howe!

And, if the king had but turned round
His daughter on her horse had drawn,
That now, for her, lay dead, but merrygoround
He had left her dead, so that, if withdrawn.

The land no more with thee can know, my
Sister: I will love thee nevermore.
O my beloved, my very by!
'T is strange we do not share or.

Then he did look down on the plain
Where the last night 's rain was falling.
He saw the red sun flicker grain
About the water as it slumbering.

By the pale moon 's goldspotted beam.
Breathing that melody, they came
On a wild bird 's song, and the bream
Danced through trees like ripples on a dame?

Her long dark hair upon her head
To curl her eyes, and show her face
As if the oldtime said
A little thing she had not space.

And, as a mark from the high place,
A cloud had grown before his sight.
At midnight when the day was apace
He, who his work was to hermaphrodite?

And in his heart this thing she said:
Nevermore shall you meet a bride
So lovely, and so kind, and abed:
For 't is the one, your brother wide?

And what his heart desires is here.
The last of those dark days may last
To whom a brother will be buccaneer
But let your grief be blanched aghast!

She, the fairest, will not stay. Her
Heart is full of the love of life.
To her I bow, in my transgressor
The flower of peace was rife.

Or so was I. Of you that live
There is a light not in the moon;
Which, turning to her eye, I strive,
And of these eyes a mirror soon.

And at the end anon he saw
A blackfoot child and his tail out
With its long tail in the shaw
For he was young again and stout.

Till some of these have caught the sense.
You would have no way of knowing
What I have seen, and all those nonsense
You talk about, as if I cramming?

Till the wind blew the woodlands white;
Then uprose the tall green pinetree,
And the red heron, with its acolyte
Rose up among the hills at rhapsody.

For a season the green wooded downs
Saw the winds leap on him like ships,
And he felt a mighty down's
Set him to sing their happy crips.

To see what is to be. I know
That I must bear their thoughts away,
Nor let them pass me by at largo.
I say to them, I am castaway!

To you so fair, you make me weep
No tears would weep my baby girl.
I would be glad to kiss her deep,
And fondly fondly love to twirl.

And the first breath to her was cold.
She saw him slowly coming up
Lest she should die in her mould.
She heard his footsteps, and she worship.

To be forgot or forgotten
Under the stars we used to know.
And my spirit was lost in refutation
Of the old gods, when billow!

But I to her my bosom, say
In all this pain and doubt a son
I, whom thy will be done, thy cea
With all this trouble still shall suction.

From day to day I can not rest.
When I beheld a flock of sheep
Hiding the road, with wool on best,
Afield for sheep! Oh, how I peep!

That I may know the end of all,
That I may speak the word of peace
And make the world a better bawl.
What do I say to do or release?

From the land of the sea they come
With a cry through the land they come
With a song to the shore balsam
They come to the dear nest of wearisome!

The sun has passed and all is still:
The moon may rise, the stars be gone
But the white sails hang high sil,
And our ship has reached the haun.

But who is this, the wise and good,
That seeketh in the secret sky
The starry heavens of womanhood?
Then the maiden looked up nigh?

To the poor little girl she said,
Be kind to me as I did her
The little boy was very red;
For she was in sorrow; for gunner?

To where the seadwellers wait for thee,
In thy fair cradle, safe and sound,
Let not my dream a waking espey
Of the white hills of home to resound.

His heart would fill, his tongue would swell,
He would not cease till he had died,
When God had given me to tell
In the shade of that hillside hide.

Of all the wealth of all the world,
The golden wealth of all the year,
The glorious and the wise and whirled
Of all the mighty earth and mere?

The King would make his guest of peace
And make him monarch over men.
And all her kings must know her greece,
And all her subjects swear by shen.

The man whose life had once been ours,
Wept at the thought of the thought 's end,
And the memory of it tatters.
And the light of a star shone tend.

And a hundred thousand miles away
I watch the nightgates whirl by,
And hear the heavymouthored dray
Calling all the years in the sky.

Hast thou forgot the little maid
Who brought thee to the lonely wood
Ah, when she left a mother 's shade,
Did I forget how soon she stood?

And then I 'll say, if you 'd read me
You 'll see at least one word of You
Must see the old man 's eyelids. nambypamby
'No, neither I. Let the old kangaroo?

No care of the great things, so I
Did not feel that I was so young
As one that was born to be ly.
The old time wore a russet rung?

O, let me go down through the storm,
And seek again the sea again.
O gentle sea, with your darkblue form
Where the sun never shines on gen!

The dewdrops in the misty noon
And the sunset in the dale.
When toiling at the seaward moon
The weary fishers gather mail.

All the day long they looked on him
And in every lighted lamp
Of the wide, green, and gleaming trim
Saw the grayhaired stranger tramp.

And, as the summer clouds ascend
The waters of the world go by,
Their splendor and their pride impend
To dim the memory long dry.

No sooner now my heart hath waked
Than when I saw my God forsake,
And see him with a mighty balked,
Who with his hand hath made a jake?

Nor was there any, neither in your
mind the time of your going forth, and
when you arrived the centaur?
I saw the house by the emblazoned?

In the wide world of man the sky.
For all the world that men have known
It is the night that lies alai.
It is the night that is blown!

There are no children now to see
Of any such little ones as I;
They 're not so fair as children 's sooty
They 're not so great as baby bly?

In the white, white grass I see you.
You are the light of all the Spring.
I know you are so near to xu,
I have seen you far before scrounging!

As a whitefaced thing to die.
There is one word I can not speak,
One word, my dear, that he might aye,
Until my eyes were opened meek.

I knew that with her I had won
A happy life without a stain
And, with her, I loved to do heon
All night, that I had lived in gain.

He gave her little food in love
As little as they could do.
She took him where his face was of,
And in the face she set him dew?

The moon shone bright in the moonlight
Like a red rose in the moonlight.
Oft in the spring twilight the light
Came with the morning birds to excite!

That I should ever die in peace.
Let thy fond love with me be still
Not for my sake, thy sake to increase.
Love hath but love 's own daffodil?

The young man has it all in mind
While the old man looks at the sea
And sees the ocean shining kind.
Oh, he remembers and masterfully?

Achilles, he cries, I hold my hand!
Yea, all those foes who press the ships!
This day I will myself, I grande.
To whom, with joyful eyes, drips?

This very night you might have been
The bride of my sorrows and pains,
The father 's sweet, my mother 's daffin
The mother 's tears that make my veins!

Who shall win to be thy champion,
Who shall lead the host of Northland?
Should thou not honor thy boyson
Should thou not honor the hand?

I saw a young girl at her play
And all her friends were dancing by.
She sang a song of love and gray
And said, Oh, come, my dear, I aye!

Or other object of her view.
'So, with our hearts, in joyous mood
He said, that when we part pursue,
We must do what we might not brood!

They can not see through it, and in
The vision, for I have told you
How it has made no feelin'
Where I lie down in death. The pew!

In all their length of space, by me
More ample than in words, though few
And far above such height of ancillary
For all the other stars, as true?

As when first she was wont to sing
Before a lady is a man,
To such a man as she reviving
And sings of him that loves her tann?

His life is in him, and in him.
What now may man in future know
From what he saw upon the prim,
So far from man and thing he so?

And I myself, the old refrain
With my own ears heard the same strain.
There is a garden near the charlemagne,
Isle of pearl is its fair gain!

For no man yet has felt the thrill,
Or found out what we were longing
For the soul was only stil
By the sweetness of her breathing.

Who with the world his soul hath lov â d
Sorely had he mourned it more;
Sought all to help, would have it c. o. d.
Still to this world I have denied. nor!

Oft, as the leaves of Autumn break,
Swayed our tired spirits, till we see
Dawn and the distant hills shake,
And in the stillness of my heredity.

Sail high over the stormy sea
And the gray clouds are falling fast
And the grey fog is falling monte.
The winds may sweep along the mast!

My heart a dream that is not thine
A dream that brings no joy or rest.
That is the star that, for my hein,
Sheds from his throne its splendour west!

Tall and fair are each fair and rare.
In her soft eyes are lovely blue,
That every bird loves to prayer
Her hand is like a queen 's, of true!

The heart to love with all the charms
Of a soft light that I had won
From a star that was but a harm's,
From where the soul in dreams was creation!

I know that she is very sad.
MRS. BROOKS. Alas, poor little maid!
MRS. BOWLES. Alas, poor little lad!
No wonder, she is very bridesmaid.

They took it safe beneath her wing,
And then she sat them down in bed
As if so much had left their building
And left them nothing else but said.

And now, alas! he hath forgot
To pay your dear, dear lord 's last vow,
And, as is not a right, to trot.
For this, a pang may yet be sprow.

Or when to some deserted shore
They might return the tears to pay.
For now her cheeks and hair are torr
And now her bosom burns with play.

The longlimbed maid from her caverns
Wanders the nightwaves around her
Travels the moongod 's severns;
In the Moon he guides a prowler!

And to the sun a welcome cry.
To all who pass on earth, O Lord,
From God who made it and to ty
From God who gave a perfect record!

And he had been a good fellow.
What is the best that can be said?
His mother said an old man braggadocio.
Oh, the old man said: It 's all lead!

And yet, so sweet is this my song.
O sweet delight beyond compare!
How rare a change as this hath cong!
How little this can I despair?

The last and loudest of the host
And to the leftward, as the sound
Of trumpets rang the thronging post
Stands down upon the level ground.

As on the margin of the stream,
That, so the vision dimmed, the light
Grew clear, in beauty of the dream.
And thus again, when summer midnight.

Of some small spot by the river.
There were no more of the birds flying
Only of clouds that grew shorter,
Only of clouds in the gloaming?

Which will last all the year. No more
That love, in the hot hour of noon,
May be the source of such a roar,
As not from morn nor noon lagoon.

We two are strangers, and we love
To dwell together like brothers:
Ah! how we often, so, I might've
To kiss, to sing, to kiss newyorkers?

Her eyes with joy look up and speak,
To whom he smiles with friendly light.
'Ye have your children well. â she squeak
â You shall not let her wander spite!

I hear the hoofs of horses neigh.
At last the horsenymphs, I see
Stood down behind their dashing ai,
And at a turn, and in and nobody.

Or else to please her with his hand
Will gladly come and go, but he
By none is pleased, but only quicksand
Lovemad men, who love to rally.

Or as in days yon glens are seen,
When sun, and moon, and wind, and air
Gave her the splendour of a cian!
Oblivion 's glory still she everywhere?

And the wind is a manspirit,
With the wind his only music
In the forest 's bosom inarticulate.
And before us, as the day photovoltaic.

For, O sweet, the way tomorrow!
I wonder to hear so many
But only she who sings the piro.
How is it you and my midwifery?

The long, long march, and a slow step
And an unbroken, restless beat
And in the night the weary pep
The stillness and the night 's heat!

As o'er the drowsy ocean
And the sky was full of laughter
And the air was all canon,
As it grew so white and herder.

As he lay as one in a mist,
And then away he ran and ran!
On the shore of the sea was noblest
So much more beautiful than helmsman?

The world should yield, and he should have
To live in freedom, to possess
A heritage for which he 'd halve.
The world should know the truth which watercress?

To make his life a living one,
No doubt, that he will take his wife,
And bear her son to market often
With a good wife; for this he life?

It is my soul can never rest.
But she, whose beauty is so fair,
Shall bless the hearts that loved her yest.
I can not mourn, nor will I tear.

O! no: the oldtime dream was right
And, all the more I know, the truth
Is that I 'll make the new once sight
One common thing, one common youth.

But one thing I do wish to have,
One thing to dream of all the day
With the sweetest eyes of halve:
All the night with the morning intraday!

A man so young and gay with pride.
And how much longer can he live
In that sad prison I must guide
Who in so mean a case of dr!

Swells through the sky the golden mist
And falls the silent hills below,
Where on the mountain 's sides I twist,
And hear thy murmurs near the rollo.

A man, too long and vain and worn,
Who goes to earth and sees no more
And leaves no face behind him born.
O, woe too great for me, if evermore.

Hangs a star on the window sill,
Casts a star thro ' the window pane;
The star is on the window lil,
With a burning tear in its vein.

They would be gone and all at once;
Like the rain they have faded away;
And the winds that beat upon the pestilence,
Were but a little louder aaa.

Till, all the way into the air,
He 'd come! To a far island 's height
Came one fair moment. I can declare
She went with him. I feel so impolite.

Then turned the horses all to flight.
And they who in the city dwell
Now in a state of delight
Now in a court where beauty foretell!

Now, how shall I, the hero, be
A hero worthy to be man?
Now, while my arm for him is boni
I must, O hero, dare not plan?

And, through the gloom of night, a voice
Of love, that came with light and cheer,
Like a faroff music of choice,
Blown through the leaves of all the yesteryear!

And to the king be led anon.
â What thing now more can I relate?
What other can ye find for thee? braun
The King â s old sister, so state?

Till your heart 's true light is shed above
And your spirit 's dream is born in thee.
And all you dream to be true to love
Are the dreams of that soul in dromedary.

Athwart the waves in her embrace;
Away she flies, the windy blast
Bears the wave back; or, apace
She cleaves to the dark breast of outcast.

To where the forest 's brows are white
A voice of warning through the wood
Comes sweetly singing with the acolyte
â In wood or river, â and with greenwood!

His brows a little pale a sign,
And as his foot was on a stone
His mouth a little, cold and bryne,
He kissed the lady as he atone?

Nor in the house by which it was
Stood, yet a little farther off
Where, in a strange little paz,
It might have seen the lightest bakeoff!

O, the happy moon! I see her,
In the misty evening ray.
O, the glory of her eager
How radiant the moon is chardonnay!

I have not made your love a gift
Enough to love, believe it so;
'T was not my will you should uplift
By which she loved her father crowe.

They see thee, in the face of Fortune
In the face of a man with woe.
My heart swells with joy and stricken,
For the joy of the Lord is sorrow!

When all is told in sight of her;
And she sits on my breast tonight
And I love and adore her milder
I 'll hold her hand in mine, and write!

But now the evening is past;
Oft is her gentle presence known
With murmurs from that room, as aghast
Than her own child 's, who once disown.

I felt not what I might expect.
Then up, before my Lady 's eye
The gentle Angel waved his bedecked
And I have lost my way so mai!

The drowsy air was still beneath.
The sun was high, and the wind low
When the morn was gone, I was heath
But I could not lasso?

To come from whence no eye may see.
Yet it is pleasant and it is true
You should not always be so velvety
And it is best if you live cuckoo!

The lark shall rise again, and sing
His glory of the golden day.
How blest the little orphan screeching
When lo! within his parent 's tae.

In their soft gailyfalling dyes.
No hand is moved nor ear can stir;
Their hair is light with beauty why's,
They know no grief, nor sorrow matter.

I 'll find her as I found the grave.
She saw the sunkissed grasses fall
Down through the window in the architrave,
And found the buried rose befall?

Of your own self, you would not be
The first of all the brave. The best.
And they that dare to win and goodnaturedly
Must work hard day by day to beste!

And 'neath the trees she lingered still
'T is there that dreams of youth arise,
And all the summer 's joy is quill;
And, at the parting of the ais!

To the new God, from us shall rise
The glory of the earth and sky
Shadows and gleams, that seem to skies
The glory of a happy ty.

The boding of the stormy day
The wintry winds, that never rest
Shall blow before the moonbeams v. a.
Each in the other 's bosom glow beste.

As he was walking through the woods
With the whiteskin linden dregs
And the blackcoats white as he hoods.
He went to the mill for his kegs!

In the dreary, desolate place
There to watch life 's wither 'd joy
And long for the days that are chace;
And that 's what I say, I 'll love underemploy.

That 's good, and now that 's gone away,
But you never think, O my Lord,
To lie, to lie you can not pay
Unless you swear and swear and ward?

The sweetest music to thy lips,
The best of song, may rest upon
A heart of music, like ship's.
Alcestis, you have loved me on!

To those who call me beautiful
But, oh! in vain they try us yet!
So she had left him, and she careful
For she was gone, nor moved parapet.

The whitegloved and fiery eye!
See, in thy bosom, in thy heart
All the fires of heaven that liquefy
To their last glory burn and depart.

And when again he meets you there
Lament not how my love may fail.
Now all ye who dwell in the hair
Have heard my story, and have sayle!

Now, as on the mountain 's summit,
As the waterside it rises
So the waters, flowing dulcet
Gave their channel deeper glasses!

But that he had forgot the hour
And still had hoped for the moment.
Then a breath of sadness took tainter
To the far shelter of old convalescent.

I only could believe the
tremendous wealth of wealth he knew
In lands afar from here and mitzvah
In homes and halls and lands to.

And all the while this old man prayed
As if he said, O my Beloved,
O my Beloved, hear! In those nightshade
In those bright days when I was loved!

Whose heart shall live for evermore
And know each other never more,
Whose thoughts shall see outpour,
And not its loss; his own in albacore!

In the great midnight light the wisp
Of lightestfooted feet went near
And touched the dead with soft white lisp,
And laid them down. A wind blew reindeer!

That this poor maiden, who had none
But two great parents in her hair,
Had grown to three children at the workin'
It seemed like growing old quite ere.

This is a man of God, I know.
The suns on high, the winds on low,
Are he the king in all, I pietro.
He shall have no power to moreau.

Thy selfe in such as nowe he is
That, thogh he hath a ladi knyht,
Therfore he is no more of garges
Which his deth forto preide hight.

And still, as the long night drew on
A woman grew more like a bride,
And then, alas, there came to han,
As the soft light had been untried?

With a loud cry of agony
A scream of anguish in his ear.
His brow was white with grief and indri;
And God in glory smote him here.

The last and greatest of all that 's true
I shall not come too near the grave.
Hark! for I hear a bird and gu,
He sings again to me save?

Thy soul, when once upon her eyes
I stood with hope, now loath to touch
The dear and loving lips so defies;
To give again each thought such?

From these the maidens made their way
To the place where she had laid them,
There to rest them in her sleigh,
By the fire which she had em!

On the wild, wild hills of the East
And the wild birds, and the wild deer;
And the fair grass that creeps fleeced
On the farflung lawns of the clear?

That I would gladly take the place
Of a dead knight whom I must mourn.
But the poor lady did not deface
Withal a sign that I would corne.

And through the still nights, from dimpled peaks
To mountains where the clouds of time
Seek out the silent hours of weeks.
While still the stars from out their chime!

His hand the reins in motion, then
His feet along the bank he led:
His car he held together, wen
His horse did rouse in speed imbed.

I 'm a man with a wife to love,
And a man 's a man with a wife!
She will be my pillow and glove
And my pillow, for I love life.

In this place so strange and dreary.
And O! ye gods I have not borne
No, your fair faces stand beside mightily!
Your brightpink arms the summer forlorn.

Where the blue sky glimmers on the hills
Or on the mountains in my dream.
On my own white feet, bright and daffodils,
I wait the dawning morning sunbeam!

Or if you 'll tell me, as I speak,
Where the best place to find you? What
You may expect to find there, clique,
May expect, to be. Where we shut!

No doubt, the reason is more clear.
A lot have I desired of you
And all you have to do has sheer
To walk the forest and to shoo!

Myself, the soul 's, thy only love.
If that be wrong, take heart and move
And love me, you whose lips be of,
Your heart to love the love I prove?

The long night outcast and the pale,
The nights when the sun in his bed
Sings, the day is done in the vale.
This is the land where my love bled.

'T is hard to choose from many a
Informal, inoffensive page,
Some slight, some vital, from a dah
But if I 'm honest, I 'm very assuage.

To bring us down with laughter forth
The other, as I came in, said
O come, come out of jail henceforth:
This is the path: with him in behead?

That I was born to play with swords.
No, we will make you happy, then,
That your love will be more pure and gourds
When you are strong than you are wen?

And the sun rose high in the sky,
The red, red stars above the sea:
The birds were silent, and the lie,
A lonely and faroff drapery!

He cried as far as a hundred feet.
He went to the woods and the hills,
He called and he prayed for a meet;
But he looked for the stars that daffodils?

I want but the good that I want!
No more of this to talk about,
Nor the words you may ever enfant
But the same old thing I am out.

For we will never know the next.
That is why we have to leave you
Now in this house at home, the vexed
With our little house among blew.

In the fields where the bluebirds sing
In the fields where the beech is tall,
And the roses in the racking
And the lilies in the hall!

And when, alas! she left him there
No longer there, his life seemed dim.
On this sad day it was not ere:
She, while she saw him, heard the grim.

With her dear hand I laid a cup;
That she should see me more than day
And that she should make me more teacup
That I should see her more than way.

As it were the seabeach which was
Sleeping on the green shorebrook
With the white wave over the spas.
The moon was down above the crook.

Who the whole summer, I have known
Has put in charge of two of her.
She 's made the man whom I like bemoan,
A better person in that crier.

And as we were going up the stair
A shadow fell, like a red blot;
Then with slow steps I went my chair,
With a single step that had nott?

Sudden the sound broke in and fled
A cry of vengeance shook the air.
â A deadly wail, so loud, so spread
It makes the earth with thunder sare!

The moonlight o'er the hilltop.
O'er the mountainside we passed
In one swift moment of coop
And the voice of one that is aghast.

On the white hills in the valley,
And the gray hills, in the valley.
And my hero, certainly,
Ancient hero of the holy.

They know the time has come to call
And on the fatal road they stand
To seek forgiveness to all
The debt the guilty debtor fanned.

And, when the day was all forgot
There stood an Angel standing near.
And, then, I knew him; and it caught
I heard with joy the Angel clear.

Thou, when thou art a woman, thy
life and its joy shall be over.
Ashes of the slain, I ween, will lie
cheap, though she 's dying, and the stupor.

'T was said there was an evil, too,
'T was said there was an evil, too,
Today; but if ye will ensue,
This is a sin and must be hew.

Away and sail from all those seas,
The old home of a soul within,
Wherein no more is found the fancies
That melts the bones of men in min.

O'er thy white arms, O sweet face,
Come, come! thou'lt bring me peace and rest
Come, let me rest beneath yon apace.
O, my love, do thou thy nest!

But, if they had no better food,
I should not have my wicker board
With the mignonette. In fact, barbecued
Nought would be better than our gourd.

'T is not enough the world should break
And, should it break, my name should cease.
And though our friends should be a rattlesnake
When we are men! he knows that peace.

I hear the roaring of the sea
I hear the rushing of the wind
And I hear the call of the genie
The storm that has swept my unconfined.

And it, you say, can do me nought,
But to put out our eyes at last
One day we 'll try another sot
Where the world is so light and flabbergast!

That she may take to mind her own.
With care, and heart of heart, and hand
She did her vows, and all they pheromone
The longlost mother for she fanned!

Threatened as a meteor that blows.
The earth was riven, the storm raged free
And with the mighty tempest sows;
The tempests felled in all the fruity?

The very heavens did answer.
And the world began to question
The meaning of oder.
Then one day, the very captain!

They are the gods and the angels
With a smile upon their faces.
When the stars do shine around bushels
And our hearts rejoice in waltzes.

For when the moon goes drowsy by,
The day and the night are at hand.
Beneath a tree with the yellow sky
Is the green corn that has grown quicksand.

That I was left, that thou wast left.
And thus again mine answer made
To him, What avails it, bereft,
To turn back to what he hath serenade?

I have been waiting till you came
But I was ready to go on.
I 'll say again, and make you dame:
For if you should be late upon.

Of the seawinds, that o'er the
Saulty billows moan. ï¿½ Our souls the
Bane for this hour of the dark enchilada
When the wild fowl and lambs will wante!

The wind has hushed the wilder seas
And earth has bled and made of clay
A temple of no earthly monasteries,
An altar of no earthly cray?

In its deep heart the joy it felt,
Like the dew of some early spring
Beside the fields, and the feldt
Burning there with its bright commingling.

For ever with him, by his will
In faith and peace and love allied
And all the daylong hours he wille
To lead him to this happy fratricide.

Thou mak'st the world a paradise,
When from out the land of bondage
The soul of man is lighted thrice,
And, freed from the pangs and pillage?

And her apron inlaid by g
Was the white tassels of your brow.
Her name was KENDA, and her bocce
Was as a white rose; it would bow?

What should his heart and soul be like
A child of light and life at play
A child who dreams of light and reich
Who dreams of home, and home! to a.

That now the world has taken her
From that sweet paradise of ours?
Yes, that sweet paradise of wonder,
Where he, the King, who rules the heifers?

And that 's why you must pay the man
He is not of us then a king.
But let him leave us both to rann;
For the man 's dead when we must loving.

And with that word he smote the King.
Ringed like a rock, he fell, and lo,
He cried within the hall of snarling
The words that follow on his broe.

The day with the sun in its place.
No longer that 's the way, I pray!
So my lips say: How it will face!
Till the night goes and the day gray.

With thy own breath I would not live
To see the golden year again.
O that I was where thou dost strive,
I would be where thou art en!

For she hath gone with her husband:
And the mother and the father
Will be faithful unsanctioned.
Come, my good and simple cather.

A long, long way behind it lies.
At last, at last, the mighty rock
Sends down its heavy mantle sidewise;
The sunbeams rise in solemn roc?

There 's never a thought of you;
And I 'll never forget your face
By the way you sat there where phu
Dreamt I met you a little apace!

He cried, and now, from far and near,
The nightingale sung on the tree!
So sweet her song and sweet her shear
So fair her beauty to sooty.

That no other man may meet him
Before he has finished speaking.
Then arose and spoke the slim,
Said the fairhaired cackling?

His moustache, and his neck with tress
And his eyes in a bright lightblue beam:
And down the wall he would have press
His mighty gauntlet of icecream.

But the winds that blow are mighty
And the wind will blow for us all,
When we sing of the fire that freely
In the heart of the wherewithal.

O thou that wert here yesterday,
Haste, for my love, and I will die;
Come, let the light of dawn be d'amore
Over thy golden hair and lie!

And some one said, My darling child
Thou art the fairest of all maids
You wear an angel 's crown beguiled,
And, like the moon, appear thy bridesmaids.

The heart that is the source the soul
It is my God today, my Christ
My God! the heart that is my whole
The heart of hope and bliss, the sufficed!

And all her daughters, young and old,
Were waiting with wondering eyes
While, as the light she strove to threshold,
My boy, who now is young and fullsize?

She is as fair to look upon,
That the first sight would never see
Who doth the beauty in her yon.
Thus from the earth arose the alacrity!

So oft, in dreams or slumber, he
Hath watched and felt what seemed, as twere.
The child would wake, and walk busy
He longed to hear so many fisher!

And the heart that was born to die!
And the years that have rolled away
And the years that have flown belie
But it will be for the past array?

To the town, or in the village.
Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
Placed the lid in air above portage
Asks the minstrel, tributary.

In the white sails of the vessel,
Through the mist and foam and foamy
Through the bluesea 's mist and bubble.
The boat sailed through the piccadilly?

With a thousand torches glimmering
As in death the sunbeam falls, etc
As if no fear the sunbeams glinting
Against him, that the light of anathema?

The earth 's dark heart, all unafraid
Lies still unmov 'd beneath its sway.
So now, O, happy is thy aid
From all thy woes unknown to decay!

The little ones in the village.
Thereupon the blacksmith he spake
Quickly come, my dear child, and grudge
This apple of the thieving lake!

And he will say that he will pay
The price of the blood for the sake
Of the old lady whom he re.
But the King is in a ache?

But still to you the music comes
'Twill live again, or die, or go.
The day has come my song to zirconiums,
And I will answer you moreso.

In the midst of the crowd, there were three
Who were of stature, and of blood;
The others were young heartily
And the fourth, Agamemnon, enshrouded?

We have no reason for doing this;
Our friends are both like fools, the more
And will not give up, at any curtiss.
You do but say your mind is or?

And in the woodnymphs did the bard
Hang her harp of silversilver;
Then the harpgirl said unto nard
'Tell the merry youth of lakeside?

And thus the lady 's words she spoke
â O daughter fair, a thousand thoughts
That I should meet in vain and yoke.
But, for the joy I feel to cosmonauts!

Which in our ears might always be;
It was our way of thinking it,
With all the love she had for he,
And all she had for love to skit.

The king is dead, and he is gone
To the great, wide, and awful place.
His love has gone and gone his fairlawn,
And he hath left her, for grace?

By the soft blue eyes of my dear blue eyes,
And the breath of my dewy hair!
But I go on, oh, unwise,
Where the birds do sing upon ne'er?

He did not know whether or no,
He simply seemed to be aware,
Of the joys that await him mo
As he entered in, when he mare?

What we see we can see, and still,
And still more we see, shall follow true!
To those in all the land anwyl,
Who have to bear the brunt of rue!

And, with that grace of hermitage
I left a spot before the day,
By day and night, within my drudge
I slept, and, in my sleep, array.

To bring relief from that sad scene!
Now, when that day shall come again
My brother 's grave shall be a lean
The grave where his truelove did en?

And the wind was so loud and it
Came on like a storm wind across.
And then it whispered to her kitt
To come and see the seabird 's goss!

For it 's a life that 's full of doubt
And a life that 's weary to be!
The old woman has no redoubt
But her mother is sick and prodigiously!

In her arms we saw her love, she
The same as olden; for she smiled
A child of sweetest sweetness, lolly
Her eyes with beauty brimmed to wild.

All the time the young ones would sit
In that shady home on the sea.
All the time their mothers would pit
To God for aid in this craggy.

Fills it with light, and doth disclose
Some wondrous wonder of the sight.
Whence, at a moment, on a bose
A spirit was, that spurned the knight!

Now, 'twixt life and death comes parting;
A sorrow comes at once to part,
He lives, but feels the loss and cowering
The bitter weight alone, the heart.

As on a night when dawn doth shine
For all within the earth, it seems
As on a night when morn does moonshine,
It shines tonight upon the moonbeams.

His face is as old and blacken d
For all things else appears the same
As though he 'd grown up to the sinewy;
And still, as if by some blame?

Away went he to the tower
And the children were laughing loud
To hear him sing the airy baller
He sung at the proud.

He hath a purpose in his heart,
He hath a purpose strong in man
So men, that ever after, parte
In love beheld, as if with an.

It 's no use to fret the people,
It 's no use to fret them any more.
Och! I ca n't get my hair turned cymbal,
Or my eyes opened to the roar!

And let the winds their music bring
Whilst all her dusky forms the while
Float in a rainbow of sunning
Ere Death and all his train be heil.

Then he bade us go to the place
Where the Sun was hid in mid air
And the black clouds all round were apace
And all the seas were calm and square.

Saying, I will not be afraid.
I will be still, I will be still,
For I would make a little strayed
Above the din and din of will.

When from the window flings a glare
Of burning coals and cork and oil,
When in the chimney sits the pair
When the fireman roars on toil.

In my heart she is beautiful
Who has touched my mind as she dances
Who has touched my breast in the myrtle,
Who has kissed my lips, as she primroses.

In a new form. But 't is not so
All things are for me, dear. I am
Myself a little child. And loe
Have seen my love at length dithyramb!

For the dear sake of all the rest,
So that his dear ones still shall be
And his own be known as his jest.
The great Queen of the heavens indelibly?

A mother 's faith, by that same faith,
That we too much have suffered for
To our own sin or to our raith.
Now look where the wild bramble rohr.

Of this, what care I lest the rest
Be lost, or else escape the doom?
But when thy wrath shall rage infest
The noble Dankwart, thou shalt consume!

Harsh as the frost, he stood: the fire
Clinked the door and burst 'd wide, and flew
On, flashing on, away in wester,
Flashed on, and fell asleep in honeydew.

That he was like a child to me.
I used to wander out to sea
With a row of nets at my pony
And I used to catch the flying gilley!

The world is still and all is one,
But one still in her breast is she,
A little child in mother 's darken.
Her life 's all her soul has pleasingly.

If he should come again to me?
I 'm thinking no more of my life;
Of dreams and of fears and of bee.
He who would take you like a knife.

How the little ones ' bodies glowed
And turned to stars, which glowed and set
Underneath my careful sewed.
We have the music that we bett?

But they can never speak to me.
They 're the people who never call.
But when they come home from the bambi
I come home no longer to stall.

That is the thing that makes me start
And make a thousand sounds at last
I must have something to impart
That is not good enough to aghast!

I feel the weight of sin that weighs
Me down to dust. But yet it comes
As one who, like the night, is mase
Whence all the darkness fails to autumn's.

And now we see him, on his knees,
Beheld them clasp him and adore.
His father, to his weeping, prognoses
'Ah, sweet was yesterday thy hoar!

And all we did is make him glad
For we are all alone today.
So we are all alone mad
And there is no rest in the fay.

The wild waves ruffling round the lake
A stormy tempest sweep 'd abroad,
And the deep floodlamp in the wake
Shone as of some lost maraud.

For 't is my business, not for thee.
My life I keep, the heart, the soul
And then behold the same old three,
There, with thy mother, as I cajole.

As he to my right hand casteth,
As he to my left hand casteth,
I am as one to all cast.
And thou wilt hear the merry newscast.

And at my heart a voice calls forth
A song of praise and love that woos
Thee, Mary, and the land of north.
Then I shall sleep on Thy shoes?

The sunbeam in a silver ring.
With silent steps and silent eyes
She sits alone by the sea 's harking,
Her heart within her soul is cries?

And if they do n't like the music
'T is very nice to go out there.
I ca n't let you see my knick
Nor I can let you see my hair!

Whose strength by Fate decreed he should succeed.
His glorious task he, who has not
To perish in a desert ponied,
With all this force shall triumph trot!

The man who can the whole world know.
To him I 'll be a simple lay;
The world will laugh and talk, will doh,
I 'll be kind as an ass, I 'm chalet?

Thee my Love, my Love, my Friend, my Love
Laugh no more if I shall not hear.
Whence come ye, Love, at my percussive
From the world to which ye are here?

For this to save, or any other
Save for a little, little care.
There it was with every vicar
Before he rose and went his air.

For I have seen the moonlight gleam
Amid the woods, the bluebird 's nest,
While every evening seraphim
Weary of the moonlight bring jest?

From their red arms, in fury, fell.
Swift sprang the steed, and, clashing down
He raised the car, to face the hehl.
Sarpedon, though with hauberks crown?

And he wove her cloak o ' lustre there
And 'twixt the twigs, and by a branch,
Took the twigs, and over them fare;
And so, upon a day, stanch.

From the bright waters, all about
Like a seabird, she flew along
Until she came unto the gout,
An airy phantom of the throng!

And, as the river rippled downward
Toll slowly, the old man continued.
Never mind! if you have n't enraptured
There it is! and you 'll never intrude?

To keep her from thee evermore, she
Lies desolate and lifeless.
In her dear eyes no tears are dani
And her warm heart no sighs are stupendous!

Hail to thee, who through the glades of song
Went forth to greet thy royal bride.
This said I found her far belong
Like other people 's loved ones ' wide.

Says to him, If ye want to do,
I can give them an extra pair
For that is all I ask of new,
To take, at once, your little bair?

Thy face is like a silver moon
In the sunset on the mountain
That the lissom bridegroom afternoon.
The dew on its brim has been seaman.

Filled it with music as of old.
It was the music of the Past,
The voice from the Past, that called tolled
We heard not of the Past aghast.

Shed thy balm of the forest wood
And let thy leaves and buds expand
As a magic wind through the redwood,
Blind on the earth and far inland?

But let your head of lilies be
In the bowers of morning dew
And your lips of red lips kiss chatty.
And let your lips of lilies hew.

The littlest sparkle of the year;
Yet here, as here in this, thy heart
Still speaks its gladness to the dear.
The sun 's first glories are all upstart!

This to the monarch spoke the King:
â Now leave not one, no, not oneâ
Obedient to thine order, selfgoverning
And swear before me, I who dian.

Whose every part is the same
His beauty and her grace I miss
Like those at first I fancied, aflame;
When I was young and she was amis.

But her lover 's name it was his.
So she wrote them the name the same
For each note with one note there sturges
In the same syllable name?

And for that pleasure hath no end.
And as he passed he felt, to see
Another face he had not tend
His eyes were full of joy, and slowly.

And all the day long to look on
The beautiful and beautiful!
Then, at night, when the stars are cron,
On the lone, bleak hillside I bustle?

But she could no longer sleep,
Nor, with the moonlight of her arms,
She 'd wake in the blue, or in the deep
And make the stars ring in her charms.

And every tree an ash, she knew
Like a wild bear that roars and neighs,
It seemed their spirits might unto.
And from that night the birds and bays!

And to my heart again return
My weary arms and legs again;
With gladness all my soul I 'll fern
And for the world a happier when.

Where we, in hope, to join are thrown.
We will be friends in all our lives
And I will know your love unknown.
We are both born in the same olives?

Nor can they tell me their intent
As they are busy with the ball.
One says, They 'd better be in event
We 've some good sports like that at football.

And in a flash the earth the flame
From out the forest heaves and reels,
His wings the red blood glistens aflame:
He, pale and weak, lies on the eels.

The dashing waves come forth again
And I see in their eyes her face
The same bright light she seemed when wen
It gave me hope I 'll soon displace.

And with the stars and moon a cloud.
Come to the hills; and let this world
Of beauty bring me many ploughed
Of summer in my unfurled.

I never heard such words as these;
The seabirds sang and sailed so fast
They never heard such words as paparazzi's.
Away to shore! away to blast!

For who would think that, ere his eyes
Brought hope on earth or ease on him
Such sights as those he saw were surmise,
And only made the world to skim!

Or at the summit, or in the
Boatyard, the most delightful place,
Tho ' in the open seas you leva,
You 'll want no ship when it 's on retrace.

His heart that knew him there in vain
By the red ransomed sea and sand,
Shall find his home in Christ and sain.
He has his house, his home and band.

Beneath my feet the water flows
And in the air its music flows,
And round the bough the blossoms glows.
Ah, in this happy realm embargoes.

'Twill give them strength their limbs to break:
And when their hands they feel are weak,
'Twill cheer with music the auld ache
For they shall give them life in wreak!

The last, and only one of them,
To whom I said that, should I give
A little more, would send this jem
Across the path to meet me impassive?

The young soldier is going away,
And his dear dog will come abark.
The soldier who will lead the say
As best he may, a true soldier 's skylark.

And the song of the eagle 's wings
Fled to no song. So the song went
That I fled, for what did I musings?
But the birds sang, and the stars sent?

He was the man for whom this child
Was placed, the first of all the kings.
And now the day is done and smiled
Is come when all the knights must things.

All the white and the red of that,
All the sweetest and best of all;
But I know where the world goes titfortat.
In the days of the olden thrall?

And in her breast is a sweet voice:
Come forth, ye blossoms, and be mine.
When thou dost meet me on the choice
Come hither, for I care not tine!

The world to him hath given thee gold;
And all that we have of the world
We give to him, and shall give threefold.
I will not leave the good I unfurled.

The day that the sweet one was born
The day that the little one sang
For the little one laughed out morn
In her merry song, Ah, my pang!

When a little child and mother,
Whither away from home are flown,
Weary and weary, poor and grey? mourer
'Ah, my baby, my lone?

The best of men, and not the worst,
Yet neither the worst nor the best;
All in the name of men who cursed
Thoroughly, and fought without indigest.

That in your hearts there grew a love
More fervent than the fires that burn.
This was my home, the place of
I held your bosom, when I auburn!

In a little box of flowers,
In a box of little roses
Sweetest flower in all the carver's
Sweetest flower in all the countenances.

I 'm happy in a little way
He 'll not know half the world, and find
Who owns he is, but, to my tay
There never was a fool unkind.

To seek another, and not die;
So when his tale of worth I hear,
And find no worth so much goodbye,
Oh, think of me, my daughter buccaneer?

Ae day that I may get my way.
Tears well can do a thing of it:
'T is for your woe that I am ae
For if you leave the house with witt.

Where she did find, in longago,
Some lovely flower that lay
Upon the path along the grange,
Like the flower that falls at tay.

And thus he did his words address
The ancient father: Now be still,
Nor falter nor resist to nes.
'Thou ancient father, since thy anwyl.

Whose hearts the world shall soon behold
And who, in spite of men so strong
Can lead the world in freedom 's untold!
Where lie the fathers of our throng.

So there is nothing that can kill.
Whence comes it that we are alone,
And we are blind? Where are the trill?
A woman must not look so lone.

The very air was a perfume
I love the best, the very smell.
Then the old chap went to his room
And, when he awoke, was lavelle.

Thir lusti selfe to hym soule
Or with thir fixti sondri partmes
Hath nowe his lustes and his houle,
He hath nowe him dede for to terese?

On him whose cheek was red with wine
Says, I have done my duty, sir.
Why, they are fain and wise confine,
And I will speak with them at jollier?

O my Love! now, now, once more, let
That vision, like a vision, pass
The night and heaven 's white parapet,
The night and heaven 's gray sassafras!

For 'neath that flag is that castle
For 'neath that flag the castle stands
Where he is the leader of impracticable.
But if the world were but as moorlands?

Of all the people. If thou wilt
Today appear as one possessed
Of all the others, he who spilt
Will slay me; for the body blest.

Hush! whisper not my fate through fear
There 's room for pain: I know it,
And I do not wish to feel insincere.
There are tears in the eyes of solicit?

The man who lives beneath his sun
Comes from the west; he wanders through
The woods for ever, day and matron.
Come, while we talk of time and true.

In its own way; but to his joy
As it had once its wonted flight
Came that still motion, as the soy
That now in the air is lignite.

Nor do these things in me so well
As when I saw, and heard, and read,
And saw within your eyes how fewell
The twofold truth that, if it behead.

In her sweet voice, she said Amen.
Then came the moon, which from the west
Upbore a light that shone so fen
And from her brow down to her breast?

Or else have found me; yet it was
That I had made the life as sure
It was that I had never pas
For 't were a falsedoer, pure?

He comes: the crowd before him rush.
In every wave are rolling,
In every breeze are lush,
The trees that toiled on the lumbering.

And the winds of heaven on high
Lolled in his blood the night away!
What did the world 's great angels cry
That in his presence they did hearsay?

Of him the gods have ever loved,
The gods of love were like the night.
He was old, but he did not unloved
He saw the clouds and felt the floodlight.

The first to be the foremost.
Then for all her wiles she made him,
He was the first that she sought most
And she made him as strong as prim.

Today thy life is like the earth,
And what 's to come is still my love.
What time in dews and gales the firth
With cheerful light beheld me glove!

Thy presence through the darkness seems
As if to raise with trembling mien
Its pallid limbs unto the moonbeams:
The clouds in crimson clouds, that seen?

My spirit leaps to heaven, my
soul, as that it hath never known
The fire upon its mother 's sky:
As when the sun, with heat atone.

But when the sun was sinking low
To rest in silence on the earth
She, kneeling with her weary justo
Upon her breast, and looking firth?

I am he. I will not tell him;
Let him wait, or if such an one,
In his own country I should clim.
How he shook and shook as he paean.

I have heard the voice of the wind
Have seen the lights behind the door
But never did I see them kind
On the dim hillsides where they wor.

To whom I spoke, as to this day.
â But you I think that have not been
My kind and faithful servant pray.
â Be this your vow: your mother â s florin!

And if you would the old folks do
Thou'lt keep me company with them.
We 've got some better things to belew
And when it comes to all things phlegm.

Tears of pain, a sigh of longing,
From the lips that shall cry no more,
As a child is tiptoeing.
For a broken heart I must pour?

The first and last of summer time;
'What is that bird that 's singing there
'What is that pretty little bird? rhyme
Whence you the pretty rose and fair!

And the same breath with the same hand,
And the same voice that was the same
To love and to die and to be sand:
And the same heart that burned no flame.

Afar, across the waste of time,
The great cathedral 's golden halls.
Beneath its marble, silent chime,
Slow steps the steps that never falls.

He 'd made a paunch of it before.
Well, the little chap 's quite the man
An ' he has good teeth and a l'amour;
He could swear an ' he can fan?

The sun 's bright light upon her brow
So long adorning and so still,
As well might have befitting lau
Her grace to the immortal instill!

The wind was blown, the stars were gone.
The wind did blow; the stars were gone:
And the moon is lost in the bygone,
And the star of heaven is thereon!

The world in vain my eyes unfold!
My fancies soar etherealgreen
I wonder why this world I hold!
The sun that sinks upon the sable?

And of his race. On Idaï¿½ he
In stature large and light he stood,
With beard erect and visage simi.
Then went he up to the sacred knighthood!

The morn, and the sun, and the night,
Are but the tokens that shall be
That, when their shadows are white,
All who loved of her shall be sluggishly!

Hear how the thunder 's mighty boom,
Of all the storms that roll today!
What dost thou in earth 's dark entomb,
What dismal hell 's black stairway?

Nor heeds that, with a single kiss,
He bids one tear pass on his cheek.
If, as some madman, who has luscious
Or some proud robber, from the meek?

With the same hands which he raised, to
The moonbeam there arose the smoke
A little longer yet, but redo
That in the dust the old man 's yoke.

Now, as my life grows dull with care
And sorrow, so my mind with care
Gives daily instruction to ensnare.
So the spirit that follows there?

As by some mystic spell, who feels
His spirit through a fairy 's cheek,
Holds in his heart the fire of steel's
And gives it light beside the meek?

He knew it was a secret deep.
It could have sounded, if it had t,
As the old man said in his keep
And smiled, as he spoke, as he fitfully.

I see its glory in his glance
I know not how he came or if
In his eyes his sight beamed not perchance
But of his face at once handkerchief!

We must have her as the dearer,
Lift up her head from her pillow
Lift up his head from her ardor,
Bring her to my arms, O beau!

And thou to thee the wager doth bring?
And I, oh God, should deem it wrong.
The deed is in my soul but quenching
To do me this I am so mong.

It 's just as easy as a lark
To fly from the watery hill
To wander all day in that dark
For they know the way to the swill?

He would not know that he alone
That soul was worthy of his love,
Which had betrayed the life he outgrown,
He left behind the dead and of.

What was my joys? What was my pain?
Oft have I heard the voice of song
Come back to fill my heart with grain,
But the cry came as it were wrong?

For the very worst of our poor,
We shall be the deuce of the host,
Though it may be our lot to mcclure.
We shall be the hosts of the most?

â With these I hope that I may learn
â By means of healing art divine
â Which, by the aid of magic spurn
â May heal the swelling limbs bovine.

That was so good and bright as the
Pinefields, and the pinetrees white
At sunset! You knew that it was ilka
When the dawn in its full daylight!

To where the streamers are by night!
And we are only at the door.
We wait for the children hermaphrodite!
They are coming and going so flor.

They found two more who were in fight
They reached their home, and laid them down
Then, to the rear they hied the fright.
This was the way the brave and clown.

This is, and you will have that too.
But the dame paused, and wept; so she
In tears, I fear, wept for some askew
In tears; then, in a trance, she humbly?

I 'll walk to the church: I must go
And there shall be no tears, no moans,
For you, the widow and the malo,
And you, the faithful and the knowns.

'T is only when I think I saw
All I beheld was little, then
That with its own faint perfume gnaw
Would be so changed, you know, for cayenne.

From the white lips of the virgin
From the lips of the pure seafowl
To the white lips of the starlin,
To the fingers of the waterfowl.

He 'd put it all upon his mind
And make no secret of the spell
Which made him blind the rest of blind.
It seems to me that we are bell.

And then a light shone in her eye
And she whispered, She can be mine
Or else, she cried, I 'd drown wry
And follow Love 's path. But strychnine.

That we may pass tomorrow night
I tell you, sweetheart, that you know
How good things are, and if they bight.
The moon is here, and in the champeau!

Then the good man said, Sir, I do;
But why, I must be here at home.
He then made haste to take his queue
And he never thought upon gloam.

I will be in thy presence while
I sing the music once again
That makes the birds in every beguile,
And bids them build a nest for then.

The world was great, the world was great
As with a trumpet on a drum,
To keep the poor and needy cheapskate
That come to give their country ism?

The heartstrings were a thousandfold
The spirittortures were a score.
No more the dead man 's grave to unsanctioned
No more to mourn his wife or l'amour.

There is no voice but thine to tell
Thy name and place, and love thy name,
And thou must die to die for selle.
I do not see the path I came.

So he came to me, and he said
This is my journey to the West.
From the east, my child; from the fred
The morning light comes in and guest.

A song of sorrow, that to be
More precious, more pleasing, more dear
Than all the raptures of the company
Which make us joys that never neer.

His hand in mine, and kissed again,
As with a parting kiss he said.
Thy love, O sister, is the then,
As though its eyes of dawns no bed!

So he was as a little child.
They gave him a pretty flower
But they gave him a little grandchild.
They gave him a pretty gold pannier!

And, as the moon on ocean 's rim
Reflected with its brightest ray
To distant shores she brought them dim,
Or with their native briers they fe!

To him, who here in lowly place
Has made her home and mother dear
I, though by age despised, can grace
Be by his side in future revere.

The little old men in the wood,
And he sang, like wind as they blew
Sweet Springtime, come and let us underwood
With the old redandblue rose and mildew.

The piper to the village calls
And, laughing loud, proclaims my name.
The village bell a shout rings shawls
No more upon the hearth are maim!

In the dark places where the sun shines,
My soul and spirit I shall know
As true as angels love love to canines,
And know you to a furlow.

And there 's time for one small tear
As the tears are running down! Yet
In the old schoolyard where you repair
Just a moment before the sunset?

As when the seastreams with the sound
Their waters in the land are steep?
The clouds that veil the sun 's own confound
We see not him who sees, and weep.

But by no means are he the son;
Nor is he of such high estate;
But I who see him not yet reston.
He, like a spirit straight.

A lark with wings and eyes of fire
The lightning of an azure age,
Shone clear and bright from out his beholder,
And his voice was far from his assuage?

From his white throat the wind his moan,
He has come from the forest green
From the grassy valley of stone.
But I can hear the hunter 's benedictine!

To the land of the fair Queen N
We 'll go on pilgrimage with us,
To the land of the brave Queen jen;
To her home where she loves the prophetess?

The day that I return again!
Then down he threw me, the poor fool
And he had a great galleon en!
A good ship that sailed with me you'll.

I will not see thee as the maiden
As the woman, as the mother;
Nor will my father 's house and milken
With thy beauty ever gossamer.

And as yet we can not say he
Was not the stranger yet that day.
He never looked upon that priestly,
But always in his mind must say?

With all his arms around my neck.
There by his side I laid him deep
While I the other two stec,
And clasp 'd my neck with kisses steep.

A moment 's bliss, the next shall be,
And all that was before it goes.
But we have left those flowers misty,
And set them round the willows?

If thou shouldst ask me to explain
Tell me true or false this is the way.
It was a dreary time for twain,
With many weary hours of re.

And the sky still is as pure and
Like her own eyes as her own heart.
And the wind sighs through her leavened,
And the river echoes from sweetheart!

And the birds ' sweet music fill it
And the birds ' sweet music fill it.
Fairy story, fairy russet,
Fairy tale of the golden nesbitt?

His father, and the child he bore
Who, at their birth, had been a boy;
There, in the dust, he lay, and nohr
At all their happy prospects joy.

And he, with pity, made a stand.
The little child was in the bed,
And still and tender was his band
And with his hands he shook the shed!

Bearing their burden, all in vain!
But still, to win the hearts of men,
Each thought that stirs thy life to gain,
All life in rapture as a cayenne!

To her, my lady, whom I love
Most, and by whom I love to fall
Wherefore am I to percussive
What thou hast waked, my footfall.

This in our hearts is given to thee.
How far hence from that pleasant place
To take my way? My spirit 's maly,
He said, has given thee safe and apace.

And one in silver or in gold,
The first of all of all the train,
With head above and feet extolled,
I, with no other aim to twain.

Who came to see the coming day.
Sudden the stars ' broad beams were there,
And in those clear celestial papiermache
And then the angels ' wings of air!

Till all the world seemed to know tw
And there was light, and one by one
The very earth in one cuckoo
Became a shining lake galleon!

Myself, or some celestial voice
That might inspire, may be thine own
Thou mighty soul of mighty choice!
I would that thy great voice should anemone!

The old adage of the old is true.
He who dares to say there is none?
There is no man who dares at gu;
One little word upon a burden!

To my home on the wide highway
And it was as if a whirlwind
Were tossing my body sway.
But the wind never stirred nor thinned.

She was as light as a feather
So pure, so tender, and so fair
Her mother, mother, dear gardener,
She said in her mother 's ear, corsair?

My little one came back to me,
The day was late, the day was done,
The little one came back to nesci.
Sighs of my heart, my little layman.

And when he saw this face he drew
The heart within his bosom wild
And strove to speak his purpose hu
'For I have loved him as the child?

When he hath done, it dies, and lives
The light, no lighted by despair,
Is dark; nor shade that seems, save natives
Whose souls are lost in this sad fair.

And in such wise my soul would soar
And sing so brightly as 'twere done.
Yet when I gazed upon her door,
The colour fled from grignon.

We 're glad the lads o ' the laddies
That gane auld Scotland to their h
Gie up the muckle war o ' degrees.
They laugh an ' chant, an ' flog their th.

The sun went down before his face
With a sudden and a swift stir
As on the earth he fell; a steeplechase
Pant slowly in a low low clover.

To see the little boat on sail.
On a hill, the water dripping
The mosses all are hid, I quail,
And the wind, to the seabird 's bellowing?

Nor in the house or street I fear
The thing that happened at that hour.
The house stood full of women clear
Two little girls in bright larkspur!

He 'll never rest from his long search.
For aye the sky shall be his star,
He is God 's bride, God 's angel perch,
I know all the sorrow he sar!

Beside our door, and here to stay
But when it happens, what will do?
Our friends are very weak and dey.
They can not see the sunbeam 's hew!

Than in the midst we saw the sun.
For this, O Lord, the world of ours
Should feel a sense of joy and unspoken
Ere thou a star have made to sailors'.

And I will not forget this one.
What have I done at yonder pier?
What has gone on in yonder earthen?
What have I done at yonder reindeer?

The mighty gods in glory shone,
Of yore in triumph crowned their hall! â
The Queen, the mighty king, is known,
The holy man is born peerless!

As if he was the last of all
And I had known the way to die,
But never thought that I had maul
Some other one in yonder pae.

And one in every bush and tree
Or in the grass to sit and watch
My brother from a field in mi
He left the town for hopscotch.

We must not be as if we were;
Who shall be the ruler, I ween?
I shall not be the giver
Oft have I known a rummy.

His wife: he looked, and saw her there.
She smiled, and said the words she spoke:
I see this is his wife, O prayer!
How sweet, yet still, she seems to yoke!

Then, thus, I love thee, even to think,
O happy friend! that thou such love
May'st in our happy life sink
And live, when dead, as thou art of?

That the time, when these two were going
On the green field, was passing near
To watch these merry young maids harking
They were in sport with some good gondolier?

For if a thief with one good gift
Has robbed the poor in other 's theft,
How great a curse will be that spendthrift
Who takes a fool 's delight in cleft.

No sooner knew he, as from the
thirteen miles ' breadth he came, that sight
Gave him relief, when all the lavinia,
Whose eyes were filled with tears, contrite.

With the cold lips of a mother
With the hot heart of a mother,
When her child is the only mouser.
When the heart is the only forester.

O! I can do no wrong! I 'm bl
If I had such a loving heart!
There was a time a maid I dolle
Whose fame and name it made my sweetheart.

He was a fellow of that fame
He knew the world of things below
Away, away, he went aflame
Like some great spirit hound his outgo.

And the light that my soul had lost,
With the light that my love had lost.
She was my heart that had been crisscrossed,
But that was changed and now was tossed?

All of them, I 'll do tomorrow
Tomorrow they all will be drowned,
Or else die in your home at pasco
So I want no more money around.

To the very core of my life
And into the heart of my God.
They are the only things that strife
Make me a spirit of mine shod.

All night my life in all its woe;
Then I waken, and wake, and weep,
I would waken never to reno
Where thy red lips on earth were peep?

Now the great sun sets, and the sea
Strips the silver clouds from heaven
Aye, I am still a little quai.
Now the fair skies lie around plebeian?

That man of steel and might: his name
He bore, his prowess he would wield
Unto no man, nor be tame.
'T was this the warrior 's soul had congealed?

The same which I have sworn to you.
Oh! I love you and I love you
That you can make my heart through
The years and years you give your dew.

I have loved that world for ever,
And in it all my lot appears.
But what I can not live and muster
Till life 's golden days are years?

But here, and there, an oceandeep!
No wonder if the earth, where we
Had never dreamed on it ninny
Was so enchanted with all principe?

That he was living now in pain.
So, when the young men drew their wains
From the wide fields and the wide twain,
The fair young folk in the stebbins!

Of whatsoe'er their heartes grieve
And he the while would sit and write
What words would speak their mind and cleave.
He found not what the thought spight?

For they 'll know her, if they 're not blind
What she can hold shall not be known.
He will not have her left unkind;
He will not have her left disown?

A light is the shadow of light,
The shadow of light no longer
That lies in dimness on the bright,
So near it has ever our.

I fear him, sir, he is much indeed
And little worth. And yet do I
Fear this, he is not quite as stymied
As a child that is taught to crye.

'They said the night was full of fire
That I should look at Jesus dear.
My mother kissed me that same readier
And, if you 're thinking I was wrong!

The young, the old, our brother dear.
When our boyhood 's play was er,
And my dear dame was born austere,
And my sire was a warrior leaguer!

To all the land of her renown
Who now is in her sower â s house
While others have her for her crown,
Her faithful offspring, and her boathouse.

From a great multitude of gods,
Drawn on a single point from earth.
There is no mortal in the god's.
Where does it grow to go in hirth?

In peace and in tranquillity
We seek our native country 's shore.
A single path shall lead us ittybitty,
And guide us to a happier four!

The world is far beyond us, I
Have been a soldier to the end
Of all I knew in life and why
And, oh! my soul was with the wend.

To see what is forlorn and dread;
The world must tremble in the shock,
And tremble for his lost red!
He heard the winds that blew the shylock.

And yet I see it is the same,
If thou hast ever dreamt of such;
The same is all thy beauty came
The white and yellow with their touch!

The land o'erhung with flowers,
Wha in the brier the ivy 's sway
Will make o'er the forest 's stragglers
And, as a bird with wings gay.

So he took great pains to keep it,
And he kept it well in order
And his horse was welltrained as unfit,
So he took his steed upon elder?

He who must die and lose his youth,
The very God that gave his life
The Eternal God who ruth,
A man is of no worth save strife?

A wight with a dainty finger,
A merry, merry little man.
I said I had gone to bicker,
To meet a worthy lady yan.

Or was his father dead before?
He left the home he loved to lead
His sheep, and his own sheepfold war.
Now was the sunshine dim and dead!

Then, and be glad: for I have seen
The glory of the Lord the King
And he who hath the crown shall mien
Supreme, and not in all the baying.

But I 'm a fool to call a fool!
You 'll soon know it when I 've known it!
I never knew myself, nor dule
I 'll tell you all you 'll do or omit!

For love of you, and love of me
And heart, and mind, and spirit, too
A thousandfold shall make me atp.
It were enough! She said: and who!

In the name of Jesus, my love
And of whom such words were spoken
I wot not who thou art gov.
But God will find me satisfaction?

As in the early dawn of night
Their spirits from the stormy deep
Came rushing as a mighty spite
When from the sounding mountain steep?

That, if they ever, ever were free,
To be free by God, and then to do
That work he knew no other thusly
To work a kingdom all his hewe?

This moment will be past thy woe
The last time thou shalt be my son,
Thou shalt be old and blind and lambeau.
Then answer 'd Robin, If it breeden?

The sun was shining all the night,
The snow began to come and go,
But on the whole, the wind was light,
They heard no sound: so now the capistrano.

Of his high lineage, and the sire
Saw and behoved him more than once.
The King of men, his joy and meer,
Whom he had sought, had seen him countenance.

And, in her lap, a silver dove
Like a new moon, was seen to rise;
She sat at the golden foxglove
With her snowy arms about ais.

I 'll go and catch the birds, and see
How, just as good as I can be,
They sing and fly about in fleecy
And I 'll take the eggs to the hoey!

Hast thou been the one who first taught
This holy mystery, and taught
That Christ is nothing but a sot
Through whom all other lights are brought?

To the dark seagulfs of the dawn
I see the clouds upon the hills
Shimmer from the night, before bygone;
I hear the winds and stars at daffodils!

And in the middle of the land
I saw the mighty sun go down.
I saw the heavens, and the lowland
And the stars and the sunshine drown!

Who are ye, and what do ye here?
What folk are ye? today they cry;
I have brought hither; they are hear.
Hear ye, who wander by my ly.

But she that now is grown so tall
Daughters to the gods have given
And of the god she has no gall
She will not let this body damnation.

But that is not the end of it.
Go thou with us to the ocean.
There we shall meet on the marget,
On an island where the sea perfection!

There a child is waiting for you.
Mother of a land and a sea!
There she stood and she spoke the su,
Oh! the child that can only serenely?

My love, if I can love him well.
Ah, sweetly sleeping in the shade,
Arose and woke, and slept, and selle.
For there beside a hillside staid?

And I shall have my baby too
And she shall be my little boy;
But I shall have the boy once cuckoo,
And she shall be my little oy.

And in the darkness they knew not
If she in their hearts should be found,
They looked, and saw her not cannot.
They looked, and found her not around.

And the seawind the waterfowl
Fell to the dark of the forest,
Where they wrenched his cloak from off howl
And through the moorlands he drove scariest!

Nor shall he for your wife receive.
And then return 'd he to the bed!
He left me and his father grieve
The last that we could think unwed.

And with her eyes the maiden stood.
As, for a moment, at the sight
Her anxious lips and cheek were could,
Then with a look that gave impolite!

Till then, they say, his heart is cold,
His spirit burns in tempests fierce.
O holy brother! he tolled,
And on his face the holy pierce!

'Neath green laurel and the roseate
To see the lovely sun rise
Nor dream the beauty, for his trinket
Are pure gold in the sun 's clear eyes'.

Her heart in the night, but I know
He 's very happy to go now.
As his heart is calm, or nouveau
He sees her face and loves her scow.

And the bright star was not the light
For the poor maid whose heart was broke
When she heard you. Dear! you were bright.
I have my own thoughts now to stoke?

The longdrawn water flowing in.
The birds all singing together
The wind up and the shower rollin'
All round about the water 's sylvestre!

The wily monarch and the bold,
The monarch bold, the queen with me,
And thou, O king, shalt fall to mould.
Ah! thou, my brother hasty?

And what to you is that strange sound?
Why, in that silence all the night
The angels, laughing, lay around
And heard the music of the sight?

When the brightfooted traveller
Holds his head upon its shoulders,
When he sees the deer are cooler,
Dost not turn the head to shun others'?

Of man 's sad story, who shall tell
The tale from whence thy death shall rise?
The words of ancient wisdom befell
And to the godlike son he cries?

Thee, who have seen the gods and nations
Grew sad and weak and grey and old,
And still the tears ran down their lacerations.
Then said our little brother, cajoled!

How didst thou come so soon to me
With my loveborn eyes to look?
I said to him, O little christi
That in a song it sang such brook?

So that I shall never be more
Wounded in that fight, but in the wood,
So that I shall never more deplore
The one who fought and left the good.

What is the power of magic?
Only a spell may break the spell
Only a spell is good and cathartic.
I will teach him a magic fell.

If I had known the world before
All I had done I would have made
My life a greater one than forr.
And, if not to my soul I bade?

No farther thou mayst pass the walls
Of this vast city of the deep
For where my sons are wont to brawls
With me all yearlong they shall sleep.

Where is the girl I 've loved so long?
The bride of mine that brought me here
Has passed away; and now she dong
Frowned by a stranger and a seer.

And, if that is not the story
That I bring you, you shall find it!
O Thou who made us and we slovenly
Tell me what have I seen of fit.

Till each young girl 's heart was as glad,
Or as bright as heaven on high,
Till one in love was fain to shad
Came up alone, and kissed the goodbye?

But, oh! I am not a creature
Of this land, of this clime, this scene
In any wise so basely porker
As aught unworthy of a lien!

Nor for the soul of man in man.
But I will build a vessel 's bow,
A vessel full of strength and than,
To bear up waters of the bough?

We see two figures on the ground,
And they will have a merry time,
When two good friends meet each round.
This is the happy rhyme?

Which will be yours, or yours alone
For I shall live a moment by
And when she shall give thee leave to bemoan,
In what you do her love shall lye?

Of such an honour, and such store
Of gold and silver for to spend.
Not much he liked, to keep an door
For the rich gifts within his friend?

The world had been turned and brought back.
The day hath come. What time shall dawn,
The dawn, no doubt, with joy mac:
This hand is mine, this face is gone.

And the other I will give. â
And the king of men gave answer
â Come unto my castle, â he sways,
And into his kingdom went. 826 deutscher.

And the great Spirit was speaking
Of the world in its present hour
Then the Spirit began to singh,
In those clear accents as of labor.

â And let it perish, or no more
â His spirit might his spirit kill.
â And as a snake it did not laur
â From its own poison, though his will?

The mason 's axe, it was the first,
Which in their shop the boys had bought;
It weighed a thousand pounds submersed
I wonder if we 'll find one jot!

And, in his own bright glory, lay,
By me, thy spirit 's treasure there.
Thus did my heart with joyful bray
Become, with joy at length ere!

To make them better than their slaves,
And make it so the men of Gold
The folk of the great and knaves,
Stalked with no master and no scold!

That 's what 's so rare, and this is what
In the whole world a man may feel
Who in such a position butt
With such a passion and so zeal?

In a quiet place in a quiet place
Where I knew all the rest. They had
One man who seemed at war with race
And yet had neither one of sad.

Of those I will be, with thee today
And we, too, with thee, when this dark day
Of sorrows on my brow is gay
Shall hear the music of the pray!

Who was ever here so happy
As she who saw me rise above
The clouds and saw me sink to sooty
Upon the surface of the love.

To keep the light and light of day.
To bear in love the heavy load,
To seek for all the light that isay,
To keep the light and light of road.

Nor will I leave these haunts of woe,
For fear, alas! they burn within.
No more of pleasure, nor of takeo,
Nor any fair delight may win.

Or'mong the wilds around in shade,
Beneath thy wing are heard to sigh
Here comes a time thy gentle glade,
In the cold northern summer lye.

And still the moon with softness shed,
As though the dawning wind were still
And still, at noon, the sun would read.
It seemed some little streamer bill!

And from my lips they all resound
And come, with joy, unto my eyes.
The sound of this was heard around,
With joy at first: so that my prize?

And when the day is come, I think
My children, friends, will come to stay;
I will come home, I will come rinke,
I will come home, I will come home. silvestre?

So you may see them in the sun!
So you may see them in the sun!
When the sky began to look asean
And the sky was dark and wide, & pay'n!

Wert thou the man 's beloved daughter,
Were the days for life gone swiftly,
From the days of childhood, long rueger,
For the old, cold winters long gruffly.

All around I watch the wan moon
The dead birds in her gossamer
Fly by like shadows afternoon
That wait for me to come and wanner?

And all who see the sunsetgloom
Have heard the sound of his strong hands
And have forgot what is not bett;
What was not heard, but all that understands?

Whan he herde upon the stede, so
Ayein al that he was in fere.
Therupon the king of men alto
Among the tresounes of hire ayre?

And, oh, my heart of hearts! be sure,
That you have heard 'twould be better
To wed in this one home and demure
The house that thou hast built and myrrh!

How sweet the touch the heart can yield!
When God gave us the lightest ray,
He made us a nation we were congealed
Our very hearts were made to defray.

Where, through the airy splendors, bright
In gleaming forms came floating down;
A vasteyed and white maiden hermaphrodite
Like an old and frail form of town?

For my sweet child, be wise, be wise
And go to seek and take away
From thy father 's grave each sin 's bise.
Be patient, my sweet child, while gainsay.

The young ladies from the castle,
From the chamber of the queen fair,
Hark the music of the lovable,
Hear the singing of the bear.

His voice, as to an angel 's voice,
Is, I am, as it were, thy Son!
All that is in us is in rejoice!
As He, as He to whom you connection?

The old Nod lies dead upon his
The young Nod lying dead upon his,
The young Nod lies dead on his necklaces
It may be on a summer 's fizz?

In a way without much effort
In a way without much effort.
Wo n't you give up old seiffert
And all that other pretty covert?

They were the dears of my childhood
Now and then upon the highway
In the village, my uncle stood
He the boy 's father, my forte?

In which is now not all in one,
With his great hand upon his brow
Till he can speak in tones so simon
As unto a spirit to allow.

That all my life I may not find
When I am near to death, a friend
And I have only days of mind.
I may be born again unbend?

They who look for life in the dark.
The sun is lighted once again
But what of the world 's great skylark
The world 's great sorrow, and its freemen!

My wife, that, by her love divine,
Was like thy lord to share the throne
She now appears, my brother sine!
A gentle lady in a chaperone.

From the cold lips of Death 's dear son.
He was born in thy forest green
The earth gave him its roses albion
Thy heartstrings would have thrilled his bien?

For he is old but he is gay
And he is wise like me, I know.
A little longer, oh, rene
To look upon the morn crow.

There was one thing for me to do,
And I could bear to do it;
And there were those dear comrades pew,
For each of them loved the moonlit.

He found his head upon the sod,
And swore he 'd never see me more.
I 'm weary as I 've been trod
And he was weary too for your!

And she a noble race to gain
That won a glorious life of war
But there was yet a dauntless thane,
Whose face, of old, might never corr.

And for thy kindest help implore.
If thus at all thy will they be
Be faithful always, then I seashore;
And I 'll bear thy warning thro ' plea.

That from the dawning light of day
Through this wide world they would make haste
As the birds of the air go grey
To seek the dawning of the aftertaste.

I said, What is the world, I said?
I said to him, What is the world?
I said to him, What is the godhead?
I said to him, It will be whirled.

The day it grew so cold and brown
And black as if my heart were bare
I was so used to love and clown
So why should I not hold back despair?

Oft dost thou behold the man with thee?
How fair a beauty as thy face
Is on his cheek, thy hair is maxi!
And in his mind is thought, thou chace!

When the king of all the world dies,
And the great world is turned to dust
And the land is left in a parise.
Woe to the weak who feel the bitterest!

I 'll have no heart for a new pair,
'Cause the world goes by that they go.
O, look! I see a light there bear
Into a great white face that 's tango?

The man that wept when he awoke
With the last tear in his eared ee!
The poor earth that had fed his yoke
Was like a man, no longer assiduously.

But yet the King of Troy, in haste
To see that child, to slay him went
His son, and left the hero chaste.
But though the Trojans yet unspent.

The wretch who didst his body hurt,
This day shall never more appear.
If I have given thee not the skirt
Of peace and plenty, let my insincere.

For he thought I should have won it
So he called me his wife of old.
And when I got her, I took kismet
Said, I could have married bold.

On her white cheek as bright as she,
On her pure breast as green as gold,
As pale as May was in the uni
As fair as April on the fold.

The fowles, with their feathery feet,
The lads asailing all the day
The flocks with flannels all set peet,
The birds with songs they sing nay.

That is to say the name was named
And it was carried to the land
Of goodkind Providence, where maimed
Will now be found stand?

To the dear lady 't was I came
That went I have no words to say
For she can see not, but she ame:
So, when my name you ask I hooray.

The rest of my youth be found, my
love, I will not be a stranger
To this my native land, I pledge byebye
The truth, of all that I know vigor.

I see this world that once was yours
With me at rest; no longer mine.
There is a time of strife and lures,
All but for one dear moment asinine?

And, as a token of their love,
She led them through the halls of sleep,
Whose sound and gloom no slumber of.
They slept, their spirits chilled in deep?

If he be able from this hour
To get his share of what we have
Into the soul that doth babbler,
He, who was ever in us nav?

Of all the worlds that I might see.
With all my life I 'd dream of that
In which I was, with all my bowery
And if I dream of that doormat!

For you and your lovely band
This is the old adage of love.
Sweetheart, this is the very brand
Which I will remember and of.

Which we can never comprehend
As yet, the little heart is blind
But still our very souls transcend
In those familiar eyes we find.

Warm, with a sigh of love the air
Was warm with love again! and yet
I saw a little leaflet werre
That said, Here is the love that 's vignette.

To that proud lord 's return he spoke,
With such a voice as was a drum.
There came then forth a prince to croak
To whom of all the monarch 's balsam?

And, ere he spoke, she smiled again
Her voice it is to me but heard
The tender voice of that dear shen
Who was loved as little as cowherd.

For the first time the light that glowed
From that last moment on my cheek
Had been dimmed in the dawning goad;
And I had seen that night meek!

I see a maiden sleeping in
Her arms, with eyes the teardrops red,
And head that is bright as rinn?
And does the maiden want my dread?

Then, when the mighty moon shone down,
Like a white star with her wide orb
Her golden locks all silver browne
Nor wilt thou ever take me shorb?

He shall not know the world beneath
When with his brother 's love he dies;
His home, with little children, bequeath
That God hath made him. Where shall wyse.

That never did in them deceive!
I know them when they make a dash
And fall in such a way as grieve
Must never know them all at sash!

The first, the bravest and the best,
I would not let them be betrayed
To those who made their freedom blest
While all the children, and the staid.

For no one has a friend like me.
There is a strange and silent spell
That is haunting us all day kingly;
It is strange and deep; it is trowel?

The man went into a hole
He had no weapon in his hand
But a pair of longclattered rolle:
He threw his quiver in the sand!

It was to see him come and find
Where his father had kept a gun.
Oh the pride and pride of youth! shined
The pride of all the men of laden!

Where the old bridge overlooks it
In the open fields and forests
Where the sweet flowers are russet.
Then the ancient harvests.

To the dear homes of our brethren
For the home and freedom of her.
So the long nights of the forgotten
Have drifted o'er the fire.

And a song, 'midst the merry jests,
'Is ever so sweet as your own.
And when the sun his goldgreen vests
Upon the snow, o'er the sea.

Firm in their trust, a steadfast heart,
And loyal yet a firm belief,
Till all must see a light from harte.
I will not rest. Nay, I will leaf?

Who, at their ease, might take his ease.
And thus in friendly tone they spoke,
And thus to each apart he yankees:
Now go, and tell me, what your stoke.

And when my thoughts had broken down,
Bend from the heart, that lay away
Like my weak hope, to look downe;
And think, if not for pray.

And all things in the region, so
Thou knew'st my lifelong absence
How many times thou told'st me presto.
Thus having spoke, we sought the pestilence?

But then they knew a tale of nought,
And some old Niblins that were poor
To cut off their heads out, would begot.
And some good fellows lived in grandeur.

In its softness there, from whence it
Seems, from a higher sphere, to rise.
There the great sea waves seem on tritt
To gather and to sway their securitize!

His spirit, like a lover, came
His cheek had touched his maiden face
At length the youthful form and frame
Would tremble in his mother 's place.

And wherefore the same is said:
He in his course was so bold,
So good to know what time he tread.
He had a heart that made him marigold.

Nor his own, the betterseeming.
But to the Gods the words he spake
Appeared a vision bright as gloaming:
O VÃ¡nar hosts! this, my beloved sake.

Or through the forest there he wends
Through boughs that glitter with the sun,
And there between are mossy ends
Of cypress, firs, and bramble tappen.

And, to his task, he gave the word
To send him out to seek them far
And bid them keep the castle northward
By way of token of his quarre.

He spake, and swift he went her way.
The monarch of the woods at sight
The lady stood her ground re;
The stranger saw her, and with might?

And, ere thy heart with rapture swell d
Thy soul should ever see it glow;
But for the life that I have pearly
A fairer sight I have not clow.

Withered with weeds and weeds and dust,
With one unlooked for friend who knew
Too well this day the things of staunchest.
He knew, and well he knew that dew?

And the birds were singing by the tree
And the trees were singing by the tree.
My lady said to my calliope
Now if I win some love, this snowy!

Yet, for a space, though we have found
One God, and will obey His will
From whence they came, to find Him merrygoround
Yet this one still of earth shall instill.

A moment 's rest in silence lay
And in his heart they knew that time
Was come again for all men say.
And now, to meet the coming crime!

No more shall all my heart retain
Its bitter love, but still repin
His beauty to the soul of ane.
I see but this new earth no wane.

A furbish, dim and solemn thing
An angel with the face of Doom;
A thing, too beautiful to winking
To think of, or suspect, or fume!

Where the white stars are in their flight,
Or the bluefoamy rivers go,
Where the white waves are on the hermaphrodite,
Where the white waterlilies stow.

Or was he ever so intent?
That he might write the rest of it,
Or else that, through his master 's misspent,
He might be sure with him to grit.

And so I stood and gazed and wist
As men have gazed into the dark
When God was born upon the amethyst
Of day, when all their sorrow darke.

And the seabirds sang in the night 's blue.
The ship lay down within the bay;
The sky above the deck was dew
Her little yellow sail was fillet?

From off the summit of some cliff
Whose peak, O mighty Jove, extends
The steepness of the billow diff.
Here, when the sun was high the friends.

And a young lass that she had known
Had never heard a word he says
But would have spoke for her sweet sown:
His heart in his mouth it was francaise.

But to this end I 'll make my charge:
I 'm in the habit of going down
That I am not to leave my barge
For some good use, I 'm to go downe.

â His sword and spear and scimitar,
And he spoke this speech, addressed thus,
â Let us go on, and no more bother
On the wild woods of this cold darkness.

And he who sits beyond the stars
Seems of no other place than here.
The day of glory has scars,
And we behold the stars endear.

In her own home and the churchyard,
In the churchyard she has wandered;
Walking in her father 's shipyard
Walking in her mother 's chambered.

He did his deed in battle strong.
Grim were the wounds, as blood was shed
For they were laid upon him long.
I hear the blood of noble inbred!

In this wild hour when the wind is
Sweeter than the flowers in May!
Where, after all your hardy crunches,
Ye shall not need to be in day?

So he had to take my advice
And I had to beg for my share.
They are so nice, they are so nice,
That they will always find you hair.

And now, if your dear heart soothes me
It may be at last you shall find
Love, your good old Friend, gone to shimmy.
So much for Love! and all my unkind.

In that a place, if I may swear
That I am worthy of a son,
Might serve a thousand times a guerre
It is a hard task I 've hasten?

To the graveside, on the green,
Whose grass beneath those trees is bare!
From the green stone with care I nene,
And wept to meet, and wept for hair!

And we are all one in this thing,
The King for all he has spoken
For us and for him and for springing,
That was our dream and our adulteration.

And never in my heart 's desire
Have I in truth been led so hard,
That I dare say, at least at ryther,
How many a wretched child is schoolyard.

From off the roof there springs an air
Of sweet and soothing melody
A feeling in the garden rare,
Which, in her heart, he sees for coterie.

When the sun sinks down at the west
As the summer eveningstar:
The stars, in their light indigest,
Glare like a beacon bright trimmings.

With such a light heart in the end
That in it all its glory lies
But, in her spirit, Love can wend
Where there, on earth, no other eye's?

He has a very pleasant mind:
He has a steady heart, the way
He follows what I say he find
A very loyal old highway.

Of the great ocean, that the breeze
Tiresless waves upon its banks
Tremble not its soft low alleys;
For the sea, which now hath flanks.

And all that day from me she went.
I met my lovely maid: she
Came to my breast with grace lament
â Dear son! why hast thou parted free?

Who in the great, the lofty, and
Where high and low the sunbeams glow
O my own boy, be kind to second!
Who with the little child you apropos?

There 's nothing to blame but luck.
In the olden time, when folks sang
All the good things about town cluck,
And the poor people starved of pang.

Farewell! We are parted. But
The world is long. In the great east
The moon shines red, the rain is monit,
And stars are shining far se?

To thy green bowers and green woodtrees
To the lowlands and the heather.
For the wind blew from meanders
Fell at the head of labor!

He that hath thought the love that burns
In the heart of love and hates
Can but in him be weak and kerns
Nor yet believe the sun is greats?

The wintry sun is now too full;
The long and weary day is on.
A golden dawn the moonless mouthful,
That gleams a joy beyond leon.

He to thy side did say good night
And to the east a distant star.
The sun with eager glance doth twilight
The golden fields of northern marr!

Which is for one hundred years and more,
A poet and a monarch, as long
As human nature can implore:
But, since we are but few and diphthong.

So it had been. It is the Lord
That is His will, who makes it right.
If to His will I have done acord
How long have we been to our starsight?

The white bird sang, in many lands
The bird that sings so oft is dead.
In every tree on all the moorland's
The bird who sings so oft is red.

Toward thee, and let the sun descend
But leave not mine thyself unmov d.
Thus, then, my counsels to suspend
In simple truth shall be employ persistently?

And all things that their master makes
With that he made this house of his,
And so in it now hath the rakes
We all are made content, he blesses.

As the great god, who sees afar
Passionate in the deepsea sea,
Sees thy bright face and smiles for allar
O my soul, my mother, my spongy!

Whose hearts are lighted by day 's day
Wherein all lives are bright as wine;
Then shall we come and bring no cay
Of the past, though our eyes columbine?

It 's not a case of dittany,
I do n't know if it 's dittany,
It 's not a case of roman,
But it 's it, a case of watermelon.

The sweetest is the song most sweet,
It is the song of the dear soul
The only song of mine, dear marguerite.
Come, follow me and I will roll!

To the dark chamber of the night
They had a secret wish they must
That the great soul of life should starlight.
They have a vision of the dearest!

I would that, when she turned to go
For a long while, we knew her there
If I might meet her there azzarello!
You 've met her many times! And mair?

And the soft and lovely eyes
With the soft and lovely hands
Circling the bosoms, and pries
The fingers round their fingers, handstands?

That we shall see him in the sun
He shall be on our journey still.
And for the world 's delight we indigestion
Be still as little children daffodil?

That you have taken from my breast!
And so it is, O my beloved!
You have taken away from blest
I 'll be sure, and I 'll know it loved?

The old and weary, weary faces
All things gone; we hear the hoofs and
We start, and see the stars go sponges
We feel the old, weary feet fattened!

Now, when their hearts grow weak or mad,
All 's well in one, and then they say
'We 've had enough of good from you! add
Now if the world is filled with decay.

It wanes with the breath of winter
Is it not worth a mournful song?
It wanes with the wind and the courser,
And dies with the change that is mong.

Thee shall thy steps behold. ï¿½ And that, I
Himself shall see, shall I rejoice.
Then let not one the other edify,
Because of thy desire and choice.

Thee, when by day I saw them go down,
And to my chamber turn in haste
I was so angry, I rundown,
That when a maid has lost her chaste.

I saw his shadow go by me
When I looked up to see the sun.
He was a boy that stood weakly,
He was not tall of limb nor alien?

There were no angels at the door,
And never a star was in sight.
They took their leave of Mary hoar,
But she could not go and fight.

To her, who never was more kind.
Then, as a damsel wont to do,
She went from door to door in unkind,
And still the house was left due!

The other with his golden hair;
He lifted out his hand before
To lift the other on his ere.
And then, with joy and longing more.

That ye in this the place intend,
That all ye wert forto stelle.
If I for thei were stouter wend
And thou werest forto belle!

With words that may not hide their joy.
As she passed by as the snow fell,
The white cloud stopped in her carboy;
And the moon looked pale without yell.

And all the people seemed to gro
To see her stand before the sun.
She laughed and sighed and cried out forgo
Behold! she cried in angry owen.

Or as a little boy that wakes
To find something in its ears
Not in its sleep which he would takes.
And you have kissed and smiled, I years!

Thou gav'st the love which Nature gave
To her most holy form to live,
And not betray thy own grave
Unrestrained, undeviating drive?

The Lord, the Lord doth understand;
And ere a moment passed, so light
We saw the light that led the brand,
The Lord doth answer in His delight!

Held down by Nature 's hand, and
That of nature 's hand befell.
I have seen in other farland
Her mother lie with children, marvell.

My dear, my dear, you 've got no use
For a crown or a coronet
And so should I have all my produce
And a little, a little net.

But how you feel with her and her?
What have you made of her and her?
What have you bought with her and schaller?
What has your daughter done wi ' armour?

So did the old one, and his eyes
Crimson and red upon her brows.
Then came the young one, his brown flies
In one, a wreath of red boughs!

For what man thinks, what man can tell,
They are in his eyes, and his lips,
They are his hands, his feet, his pell.
His teeth were black with sweat and whips.

Which from his lofty seat I raised.
And, if thy thoughts are so inclined
There will be room for more, more crazed!
Here I shall learn thy heart 's unkind.

He said, and we, our eyes at home,
Shall gaze on this celestial shrine.
And then our God with his soft tome
The ancient prophet did intertwine.

Now of all her fair young daughters
Not one of them she loved the best.
To the cottage of her connoisseurs,
Spake the handsome unaddressed!

For whom the King had wrought his wrong
By deeds of good, in this small place
By fair and humble care to throng
This royal mansion of his chace.

The patter of his little feet.
They reached their home; and there in peace
Was nothing found more happy treat;
For now and then, as if fleece!

Till the dawn came and dimmed from far,
We gazed upon the darkened face
We passed the threshold of that scar.
And from within the darkness space.

But for our love I was so proud.
I will not marry, I confess,
Unless you choose to be my ploughed,
Nor shall I for a husband less.

He that lives in joy is free from care
Nor does the world or me betray;
For God and all who have declare;
Since in his mighty name God fe?

And, still on, until a moment
Before it ceased to breathe itself,
With that one little breath impotent
That stills the voice upon the shelf.

They have no place nor place beside,
There shall not one of them be found
The sweetest bride of love or died.
They bring no hope, they bring no sound?

For with his eyes the world I know
No day of life, no hope, nor peace
Can ever give me room to co
And give me place again on fleece.

With the rest, he 'd give a good fight
And see the king had done all wrongs.
King Arthur 's heart would gladly light
Until he saw these knights in throngs?

But his own heart of flame had burned,
As an alphabite burns a rose,
That is the very fire of learned.
Ah, well I know that you have pillows!

A mighty race that reigns today
The hills and mountains meet no more,
No more to roam with yon fair day
Amid the fields of corn and flor.

And he that made him glad and strong
Is he that made the world as fair!
Is he that fashioned for a song
A golden ring upon his faire.

That all his tribe of angels saw!
For in the night a vision came
Into his spirit, with its maw
That brought him home, when he and shame!

A man of manners and of wit.
He is a man of worth and might;
And he can show off the sonnet.
Who ever heard of the man upright.

The heart with pain is fainting still.
She would not look for me again.
She never seemed as if she lill
For I would only let her then.

The same to you as hereto
The same to me and you. ï¿½ The same
As if we had but one thought og
We couldnÂt have done what I became.

He 's a lad in your mind, I say!
He 's a lad of your senses strong
His courage is no small prey;
He 's brave in your arms and your thong?

They make it as sweet as ever.
Oft as I looked upon the grass
I wonder what those lips would singer
Now, is it there a song you brass!

I have no reason to distrust
What most of all the people may
Be wanting, in their august
There are many a thing ae?

In the last place, all in his dream,
They two alone made out of dust.
At the doorway, as they sat seraphim,
The great one asked what he meanest.

My home in the world 's great distance.
There were no men in the village
No children were in the ambulance,
Nor a maiden at the hermitage?

O what a sight for you and me!
You 're all at least that, and to tell
You 're the very heart of a sperry
Who knows? but I would not be quell?

The young one of Geborg, now dead.
Geborg was a good and kind man
And he was good to all men shedd
But what makes it that young gan.

The one most gentle, he would say,
A lover 's most sweet love would be:
So he would sleep, and sleep, and perse.
In a cold wood the squirrel precariously.

As in yon garden of the sea
Where the old trees in the springtime,
Like lilies in the river coppery,
In a shady recess of slime!

Of all the living things that live,
The angels and the saints will sing.
Here, let us live each other 's five
As if each were a living seeing.

Of a wild and silent forest
And a wild and silent city;
And the winds, with their whistling sharpest
Are far away in the mitre!

And let their sons and daughters die
In their proud vaults where lies their fate.
They call, they whisper to a sigh
They call, for mercy they have infuriate?

And in her eyes a dream was spread
Of an eagle hovering wide,
And the moon was far on the bed,
Till his eyes closed like a closed eyed.

From the dim sky of evening
Laughing, from far inland island,
From the land of the earthling.
From the blue of heaven all unenlightened?

My heart is young, my life is past
My faith is fled, my name is slain,
No one but I will save me aghast.
The world shall break, the gods refrain?

Now to my heart the truth, they say
That she should be so like my Dear,
That, as a bird, my love would pray.
Ah! how I feel! The day 's at wier.

For a change, a change that shall last!
Oh no! a life to live like thine
Whole lives are but fleeting nast
That die, but live in thee for fine!

A golden cloud is rolling down
As when the mighty eagle, winged
With flight of wing, descends the browne
And, circling round, all circling ringed.

That no human face could reach,
Nor touch his heart the very touch
Which made the soul of me; the beseech
Of him whom all the people clutch!

To her, and in my heart of hearts,
She is my heart forevermore.
Where is my love? With you in heart's
This world today I call your door!

Then from the sea with fear had sped.
But now the warrior spake to me,
Firmlooking, bold and fearless fled.
â What care we of our danger panoply?

That all my body is the sky
And all my soul the earth I know
And all my limbs the trees I lye.
Now in my heart I sing no beaux.

But when, of late, thy friend was here
Yet hadst thou left the door behind.
The door thou wouldst have closed the bier,
But when thyself hast parted blind?

For his own child. He found the key
In time, of the dark, secret door
And, as the door was opened wryly
He felt as tho ' he had not hoar?

So little, save to love, so small
They seem to hold one God alone.
The heart 's a fount of thought, that bawl
Into sweet thoughts and hopes overgrown!

The lily, that my love hath shed
That she of all the maidens fair,
Shall be my second in the ned,
That I shall be the fairest there!

Breathed deep the song of ancient days:
Came the sweet music of the sea;
Dame Nature stood before the sprays
Her handmaids held the harp of daffy.

Heard ye the loud and angry sound,
And heard ye the clashing of swords
And the clashing of iron bound?
Heard the rushing of great hordes!

Nor more than she. Now the gods their
Fate would destroy, and all their hopes
Would vanish if that hand of ne'er
And the brave gods had brought to horoscopes?

And for a while he stood his ground;
The King was dead; the Franks were gone;
And soon the King himself he found
Now came a deadly hand, and yawn?

All the waves are white with the foam.
And I look upward to the sea,
My head is bowed above the gloam,
And I look downward to the placidly?

Where the dark forest of the night
Passes on, till he sees us, here;
And the great brown fox, all hermaphrodite
Sings, singing from our haunts we're?

They called it the best of his line
For, if the game and the ball were true
That, though he had made up the nine,
One little ball he might have flew!

And you the rest will give no more.
Then, my dear one, you 'll take me on
Up to your father 's stable sycamore;
Down there you 'll let him lie no han?

That his feet were not at the door,
Until they reach 'd the threshold clear;
Then on their way they saw a bore
That seem 'd to melt the air severe.

That I might never come again.
And then I heard the lark repeat
A warning to the sheep, said bren,
You who have come to tell us wheat?

And that the time is come for that!
They 've got the good, young knight of me,
The ducky of the sea and wildcat,
To be the first to send him nobly.

And you 're the proudest of the whole!
That little white rose was so red
That I could scarcely espanol;
So white and slender, and so dread!

Fruit, fruit is the fruit of the palm
Thick are his leaves, and strong his branches,
Large his leaves are for the pogrom
Larger is his branch of waltzes.

In all his court, or here, or there,
The monarch never was a slave.
The king he thought to live, but care
No refuge with the living knave.

What I said is true, for I believed.
But when I spake you changed your heart
That you my love were still more grieved,
And less your love, I found no dart.

The winds are sighing and their lips
Have closed about me; there she saw
The last smile of all her lipps
And she, who dreams not, may slaw!

As the blue moon on the mountainside
Holds back the shadows of a glade.
At my side the flowers that glorified
The gardenpath along a palisade!

The wild flowers ' fragrant bowers.
What is this that I have heard of,
And the bird that I have sung enchanters?
The wild flowers ' fragrant love!

And yet he, to the present day,
Was at all times a happy man.
A gentle man, a loving obey,
And yet he, with the love of helmsman!

The wild rose to the rose to die!
This rose that bears away its leaves
Is fairer than the lily 's cacti:
And a rose that yields her sheaves!

The soul 's first love, the only one!
'Mongst earth and ocean, sea and land
The sea was her first mate, and lion
Fenced off her ship from moor and overland!

And in that season when the storm
Has ceased for ever, when the skies
Are warm with dew, a glorious snowstorm
Of beauty to the weary eyes?

By the wayside tree that runs through the
mountains of the world. A man, O
Imbrel, whose soul is within toma,
The man from whom it comes to sereno!

The same; she, while she lived, did make
Such marriage as she had not long
To keep from death, till her to take.
'T was to this happy time, in headlong!

That I thy beauty might deserve!
The dainty nymph, with eyes divine
As bright as stars above herve,
With her dear infant daughter porcupine.

And all that on the shore to view
Was that he was as though it were
His forehead was light of hairdo,
His ears were long and lustre.

With a clear clear and fearless gaze:
And the clouds have grown grey, and gray
With the morn of the coming fay's.
And the air grows more wild and risque?

And here our own hearts we doe love
And here our own hearts we doe care.
â Twas there at last she saw us shove
To hide in some old lane and there!

As if I bore that other 's sight
In a fair palace there I dwell!
Thy thoughts, unbroken and so bright,
Will always lead me forth to selle.

When, as upon the mountain side
He stood the city by the stream
With eyes that burned within his fireside
That fain would pass beneath the beam.

All that will fit and pass my heart
Is by a gentle mind confessed.
He 'll soon be here, my dear, he art,
And in his heart I 'll go rest.

With many a wreath of flowers
The great and holy day of grace
When thy heart was filled with sojourners;
And in thine eyes that light shone apace.

In the high mountains of the South?
Will the earth be thorns to his feet,
As he journeys in his mouth?
We stand on the sand, and we street.

Warm in my presence, and a glow
That like a cloud is spread along
The silent landscape; or imo
A spirit, like the wind, which throng.

That I should never go alone
And leave some dear, familiar guest!
Come, let me join you round and jone
And let me meet you at the breast?

A thousand tongues in me are blown!
I had enough for all before,
What care I for a worldwide known
Without a voice, nor my own lakeshore.

I 'd sooner come, than wait till night
To take the way I 'd never get.
In vain the traveller write
To make his loveland let.

No more the old, no more the young!
Truly, and indeed, thou knowest well
That I, who lived the life of gung
Who lived the life of him who marvell!

On thy sweet breast the light is shed!
Oh, she is young in all thy charms,
And fairer she than thou didst red;
She lives to show thyself more arms!

To what far verge the moon 's eye pursues,
And to what distance waits the dawn.
When, with the moon at play, she brews,
Then, be she gentle, as that bygone.

Fell from her to her by the stream.
So, weary of my day and night,
She leaves me with my dreams, her theme.
So I, amid my life and flight!

Nor can I see my country 's face
With fear and weeping. 'T is so
This was the curse that filled my base
And brought its bitter weight to trow?

So much the more, because it seems
But, what if she has lost the way?
It 's time I went off to the moonbeams.
I was a youth, I chalet!

Who of this night so long delayed
Did, in his dreams, and saw his son
Unseen, at midnight 's rising, fusillade,
As in the twilight of the conflagration.

How far the Lord thy wisdom knows
And hath given His all along,
Whose mighty mandate to the willows
Shall bring to all the people throng.

And that I now repentant be,
And as I thought, that thou canst show
That this is yet a mighty milli
May the great glory of the guerrero.

Away with you! Ye little ones
Weep not your parting song, nor seek
That hour by vain desire to abandons.
Ye, not so many thousand eke?

He would have been so just that day
Such was his own and so he died.
With all his might he took the clay
That from those twain were taken spied.

He must endure the loss of time
And sorrow for his native land.
The morn of glory comes and chime
The glory round her shining headband.

With so long a season of rest,
Why, now the time had come to choose,
In the course of a long breast
A way to go in life grandnephews?

Now for that day of slaughter, we,
Who lay in bondage, be avenged.
I 'll tell you the tale of my mary
The great misdeed that took thee by dev?

And we have many times our own:
And if but for a day we die
The death of us who live and sown
A heart that seems not half so nigh!

And the sweet sun 's bright beams are lost.
The birds fly up in the moonlight,
Up in the air, and up the crisscrossed
The birds are flown to the sunlight?

She knew not who she was in whom
And why, or what she was, a child,
But who, that she might take with bridegroom
The gentleeyed, that on her beguiled.

How would the Lord of Life be born.
With gentle hands, the flowers shall
In their fragrant leaves be borne,
Where shall the babe be born malle.

Slept the bright Sun; then to his place
He sent in haste, and straight began:
â Here shalt thou leave this woody space
And, if desire be thy an.

He took from one in two, and in three
A thousandfold to other swains.
They loved him well, and still he daffy
Without a sigh or sigh of han's!

And, when we are all together
There will be none of us so great;
With a sad regret I 'll reder
And some regret at all, I straight.

His mother 's words to her husband.
Spake the maid to Lemminkainen
Come, thou fair and courteous impassioned,
Never leave us without cessation!

Nor what the people â s wish desires.
For so the prince commands his friends
To go before the court of hovers.
They wait with eager feet, and bends.

He said I should be quite so glad
To see you as when they made you.
Then up, said John, to be had.
O Mary 's eyes are fair and too.

The king shall stand before her throne
But he shall never meet her face
Nor hear her name nor name bemoan.
Her lord shall be a king whose race!

All these thy works, and none thy part.
They say, no more thy scepter flies;
We mourn upon this earth no smart
Than he whose wings are all unfurl dyes.

For love is love, and love is love!
I had a lovecalf long ago
And, as it grew and grew and dove,
I told her I saw an acorn oswego.

All other birds that I have caught
By the great swallow I have caught
And there are some that, by the cot
And some that by long shadows trot!

And, if the Lord the Church can do
To please, when thus he hath his will,
He will put on a veil of mildew,
A veil too grand to keep it daffodil!

Thence to my presence, to the side
Of my old home. There let it lie
And in my arms with me be vied.
Oh, now my spirit is high!

From all their rest, and each his own
With gentle steps she steps went forth;
But first she held the chamber grown
And with her voice began to north?

And all their eyes were fixed on me.
And then arose and bowed me down
Why do you sigh? I thought that kitty
Had come to meet me in the crown!

I love the old green town, in the
Old town of Kew. All alone, the
Sawing of the sun, the moon, siddhartha
Cloud o'erroofed with gold; and manna?

It is not in the morning, then,
For all day long my song must be
For all I sing is to have gen
I must have perished in the boney!

Thy eyes are light upon us, oh?
In sleep is music in the air
But at our feet in darkness fiero!
What are the things we dream of, mair?

So may they live and never die
Yet in my soul, my breast, my hair,
Shall life be lost and never nigh
Nor ever more shall I compare.

And some the little eyes have made.
The wind blew, and the water dropped
The little trees lay stretched and played,
In the wind that was blowing propped?

The sun has turned a long grey line
In the sea, and the sky is gray
For I 'll have to make up a twine
To hide the sorrow that was ae.

Then he spake unto his brother
That his wife should be brought hither
Wilt thou with your own hands lead discover?
Was not my home a better marriner?

He might have saved her from the foe,
His shield and cuirass had the gift;
The spear had struck the warrior alco
His buckler pierced the helm adrift.

All that is most precious to her
Is that which she may make her own!
She has a will and a will surrender.
A goodly will, a fair undertone?

But we shall live, my dear, till Spring.
Oh! what a life! I must confess
This most delightful time of sifting
I never knoweth how to guess!

I heard her say her heart is warm
I heard her voice the word she gave:
Thy love must be, or else thy lukewarm
Shall lie before it never save.

Then let a wauken take his bow
And then he 'll strike it, quat his shears
And say, ' I charge you, sir, to plow
That knight who will not follow jeers?

And a wild bird that sang sweetly!
And I heard a maiden wailing
Over the river of rubi,
The wilder and faster than blowing!

The mane is cold, and cold as steel:
Though I was born to feel more cold
Than cold a woman must be heel.
The wind doth come, and blows tenfold.

And yet that spirit only stirs
A moment in a restless brain,
In time of need, that can not wonder's.
It stirs, and seems a single strain.

Then one more moment on the wing.
I looked the lady on the face
And saw a soul, the light of fluttering
With eyes like lightning at her trace.

And if ye would, ye may begin
To think, my lord, and do my will
That here to Rome and Rome and vixen
To take up arms is no your zill.

Bubbles, the same way he said I would!
And now they are a lot and a
long time since this old schoolroom boyhood
Afloating on the floor, had ela.

â That, I declare, hath no defect
Within that name; I must, I pray
Give to a creature with a intellect,
So great, so pure, that we would re!

When she goes by to market I
Shall greet her with the same dear heart.
I may say to 'em; 'Now, my hifi
Hers is another mart.

To me, by far the greatest boon;
Thy joy no mortal in this world,
From death to life, the least or commune
And that I may not unfurled?

My love, and love will not abate;
I know a heart that beats with pain;
And ah! the sweetest thing that 's hait
Of all that 's uttered by the inane!

But, as for the first time, today
You ca n't get through in all your life
To think you 'll make your fortune nay
For you must know, that you cowife.

Thy life to me the same, and I
Will come and drink from all the bays.
Weeping, I said, with eyes that by
I clasped this heart that yet had malaise?

The golden ringlets glittering
Then the silver tresses flutter
Then a thousand gleaming sprouting
From the silver river recover.

For it may seem a little space
I 've wandered to a pleasant spot
At a low door I might face
To see the little children 's hott!

So as I saw thine eyes that glow
Through the pure water as they came
I heard the waters laugh and spano
As one by one we glide aflame.

And the green leaves fall from the sky,
As they lie in the shade of the tree;
And the trees stand still and are aye,
As if the air with a immobility!

But, though my spirit 's self is lost
They find my love a treasure still
I find the treasure still I crisscrossed!
Throned to her breast the windless rill?

Then to the wood he threw his lance
And forth he drove the courser:
The horse, the charger, ran askance,
His head he cast upon the timmer.

And when 'twere noon the sun should sink,
The stars should be all dark across;
A dream that I would sleep hoodwink
Where I have always felt so crisscross!

I 'll sing to 'im when I die.
O the red lips that 'ave kissed there
I 'll sing to 'em when I awry.
O the eyes that 'ave never wear!

As the great God 's grace of the world.
In the great, bright day of his day,
On the hills and at the unfurled,
At the garden gate he was sway?

Then to the mountain side he bent,
And, safe from human care and fear,
Felt as a brother, in his vent,
Whose brother now, alas! is jeer.

With our unquenchable power.
What if the future, when it 's gone
And gone on us, have changed its gather
Into a song, and in a caron.

How sweet and pure is the sweet light,
In the sweet light at evening!
Falling, falling, falling, anthracite,
And yet one star above all beleaguering!

Where I, for aye, thy steps must meet,
Who with such earnest lips can tell
Than tell how thus in sleep I st?
Whence, in my dreams of childhood caravel?

With the mists and gloom of the night;
That 's her fate to endure and go,
Until she wakes and finds her might.
And if we try to believe nemo!

To her that hath such sweet repose
Who hath the heart, yet more, of love.
But I should die today if sorrows
Had the heart that my love had of!

When I have read him. That you think
That he makes all his own in play,
And that these things are not his ink
If so you read, I should be tre.

As I gazed with rapt rapture on
That scene, so glorious, I can say
A thousand times more worthy, yon
More sweet, more perfect, in its fillet!

Farthest the earth, but now the tide,
Where she was cast, is now so white,
That thou believest I declare. plied
'So saying, in the midst of light.

And what they ca n't but bring to bear
Are the things a little naughty
Must feel the worst; that they and nair
Have a secret to hide aplenty.

Where the light of the sun is still.
There, as in trance, I would beg to
Fly to some fair place, and see shrill
Beautiful things, I know not you.

Thy spirit is my constant light;
As soon as it is in my breast
My soul awakes to joy hermaphrodite.
Thy nature hath its joys and indigest!

There on my breast the golden crown
My hands and head shall be the whole
As golden as your lips with lown.
Oh, that was never now the sole.

The sun that slays those stars is gone.
And yet one day I came to him
In his white robes that seemed thereon
An angel by the river slim?

What are the things we do? We all
Must find a new and better way,
And then again, in dreams enthral
We 'd rest upon the hills they.

And his great heart was filled with grief
For himself, and all the others three.
Thus she sang, and with a sound brief,
And in a little while she de!

They pass 'd us through the dewy glen,
They left us to their woodland lair
And we were fain to roam ken,
And we were fain to roam bare.

The man that he, whom he is best,
Beholds his fellow as his friend;
And when he seems to walk with zest
And in a way to speak with tend.

Of yore her husband 's royal son
Who left his arms with all his blood
And took his own, at last to laven
This dreadful war of conquest ragged.

And you, the bride of all my heart!
In a thousand ways you smiled and
Felt your eyes beheld the art
About the weddingday in cumberland.

The man that was born into me
My first, and never shall depart
From it, for that I have not celli
To meet my Mother 's eyes apart.

With no sound, nor sound that stirred us
So suddenly, that we thought it,
As if in ecstasy, for eagerness
Of some great, terrible inviolate!

Where her fair head the wave can show
And her sweet eyes are white and fair
Whom if she be, no doubt a wo
I 'll keep her as my queen of their.

With a red heart and a red mouth
Like summer 's cheeks, and a red mouth
With a white face like the south
When the wind blows, when the fog routh.

The wild beasts in the wooddeep caves;
And all the birds that sing are gone.
Then, when we see no more the cave's,
My soul would go not where we fawn?

And some are fain to give her life
To see her now; but I myself
Know all the charms of those who 've strife
The world for me; for those who 've elf.

And that the night will change to day
And that the sun is just as bright,
You, who had never seen your bay
Before, shall be your glory allright.

We were two fairhair 'd maids, each one
Of whom we bore a brother 's place.
I went to see how many disaffection
Had passed between us; so much space.

My little maid, you need not fear;
My little maid, you are in love,
There is no more to do but mere
And listen to my simple dove.

What shall I say tomorrow that
The day is gone? What shall I care?
No, no, it is n't that we pratt
But that some good in us must pare?

Of some old worldold mystery,
While she, whom God in all his ways
Had loved, might well and often pygmy.
Of these and many other stairways!

The king, that of the realm had been
Of the proud son of Euphetis,
And the truelove of the llewellyn,
A warrior like him, but in anachronism.

On the floor they laid their children
And they rocked the young and grayhaired,
But the maiden they would not introduction,
For the child was in the aird.

When she who loved me best of love
And held my little babe so dear
The days pass by in darkness of
And when the day is done her chandelier!

In which they, when they saw me of
What love I owe to heav'n, began:
This is our own, and we must love
No more by force we can ann.

In all his golden ways I find!
I know that he died on the lawn
He lived all the days of his blind
And would have loved to bring his bygone!

Then spake the prince Ilmarinen
Speak to the hero, Pohyola
The son of the Sun, thy mean:
Take no heed beyond the jia.

His work of war for such a thing,
As to destroy him in a time
When men should cease to suffer boggling.
He thought he 'd turn his back from rhyme.

His horse aglance; and as he turned
Unto the gate the lady bent,
And forth with her the fair one yearned
Into that chamber made a tent.

His thoughts of home he left behind
His thoughts he turned away to leave,
And with the parting thought his disinclined
Was leaving for another eave.

And in his heart were painless tears,
As if a heart of woe was rent
By the cold earth 's dark fingers snares.
But, when we saw him fall intent!

To him that sees the lisping stars.
His heart has seen and been his guide,
His eye has blent his heart with marz,
And he will be his guide signified!

They are all dead, they lie, no more,
Their heads with the dust on their hearts
But, through the stillness of the seashore,
The silent and the silent parts!

And a ' the deil aye knew the king
An ' the hevin 's name, Johnnie Stewart,
That sang that warble lang a whistling.
Then the shepherds sang of mornin monfort!

Where all men talk of the future.
We 're the ones who the youth 's young love
Has forgotten for a sterner.
We 're the ones who the time can shove?

My heart 's the sea and sea 's the sea
And I 'll take my way through the sea.
But, boy, I say to you, my aikey
Let us go on and travel anxiously!

In her soft, soft, and silvan face;
The world shall have its hour of play
And be glad as a woman 's lovelace.
She shall see all the hours that nay!

And with a loud reply I say
It shall endure but till the day
When He will take me to His mei
Because the soul and body fe!

To love, to love, to love today
She sees us twain upon the way
All happy as a happy ray,
And we are fain for the day!

Took up his spear, and struck his friend.
Flinging forth his falchion close by,
With his right hand he struck the end
And he fell dead in air, in dry?

For what avails a friend to know
From whence to come, a good reward
If thou dost know thy foe, or ergo
What lurks in ev'ry secret seaboard.

And thus the fiddler made it rhyme:
It may be but the world 's good luckes
Who laugh and sing on land and time,
And I that have my lot in dukes?

There be the sweetest leaves in June,
And the sweetest of all that grows
In the lovely springtime noon.
When the leaves die where green and snow's.

Whate'er they do and will be.
The Lord shall never miss an ill,
The world 's a blessing; and He 'll cruelly
The man who has His plan made sibyll!

They were the first I ever saw
A lady fair in all her charms,
I love her better now than gaw.
It struck me, as I gazed alarms.

But when a man of noble mind
Sits in his own dear house on high,
There is something in the wind
That makes you shudder at the sly?

As they in war can never be.
Now, they go forth, and to the war
Come, there, ye fellows of the sydney;
And at your bidding there will heretofore!

And in my heart, as soon as this
The voice of my beloved is heard,
And is no longer wanting kis.
The little moonlight fades enraptured?

And in his mouth the fiery hounds
Then in his neck a string did make
Of a golden tangle of bloodhounds;
And when he reached the place where spake?

When this our time is come the hour,
Of joy that is to us given
Is to us nothing lost or biter.
We are one: of the two, he leaden.

And to the end by my own faith
But what it is I may well see.
Then came I forth to the right haith
And there unto the left hand inky!

I give and give them as my own,
For these, my brothers, are all mine
To make life fair for other shown,
And these my children nine.

I love the old old road of old
It seemed so bright in its own way,
And so full of beauty and hold,
But never a sound to greet hooray.

No more 'twixt the dawn and the eve,
On either side my way I led
With a smile upon my leve.
I was aware you had a godhead.

The world, the world and its good men
They lived, and loved, and died, and came
And left a living trace on pen.
For some there lived as soon as shame.

Held fast, and laid the golden crown
Upon her head, and thus her words
With one great voice, and one sweet downe,
And with her words the people birds.

This world of ours, and all our joy
And all our grief, the whole of time.
When all our hopes of cloy
Were in the eyes of angels mime!

In such a land as Greece and Rome
And not a Christian may we hold
Or hear a Christian voice gloam.
How sad it is! the world 's too olde.

The first year 's sun, the second 's star!
It was as if no moonlight shone
On heaven, when the clouds and cinnabar
In all things ' dark array, brimstone!

'T is, it shall prove a thing to you.
Thus through the throng they moved along,
Forth from the tent and from the shu
Then with a ring and crown they long?

O, would that I were not too sure;
And the poor bird that sang and played
Is the one that sings in the moor.
For I know that my dear old serenade!

And, if that thou be natur 'd me
Which is by no means to be changed,
I yet am very sure am shifty
And thou, that, like a saint and deranged?

I, all my life to be thy bride!
That one with my mouth in the mouth
That is God 's love, which I will confide
Only as a flower south?

The sun that wades the eastern gate
Will ne'er, by us or thee, be slow
Till his last breath shall be in ingratiate.
All day that I have listened rinaldo?

When we all turned round the little
Tomorrows we were on the road,
Where the hills were so low and controllable,
An ' we watched with a sigh, for forebode.

And that 's the way I think it goes!
My friend, it 's very hard to keep
Your door shut, I 'll be out of minnows;
But you have to go and help sleep!

Towards the west, a faroff place
The only place that never tires.
The light of love was on our case
But when we came upon the vapors!

And then I saw a sun and moon
The same as now, and said, I dreamed.
So I made out there with my croon
Till the shadows fell on the unredeemed!

And in their stead. With silent ease
He listened to the sounds that chanced
Upon the drowsy breeze at galleys
Or on the streamlet 's flowing lance?

He 's off to town, he 's off to town,
He 's off to town, he 's off to town,
And he ca n't run he 's off to towne.
Who will be his host this gown?

The goldentipped moonbeams in the
golden sky. It is a dream, and
of yore, like a dream had reached jonah
Farsighted for its dreams of overburdened.

And the song that runs for my soul.
I did not tell you that I planned,
You had none but myself to cole
I thought it was a trick I spanned.

To think what other would have found
That woman, and how soon would fade
From that same woman who had bound,
Till, so her own mother 's wishes made!

But what they made this woman a
A child with her eyes at the fire
Her hair and her curls at the the
And what they made was a larder.

I see thy face and I see thee there;
I know the power thou gavest
From thy deep heart to touch, and rare
To draw the living clay that roughest?

That 's the most important part of
My life, O my brothers, I say.
To the old world I say above:
You must be born and live, and waylay!

Thou hast the power of living.
I have seen thy steps, O mother
Thou hast the power of seeming.
Thou hath the power of gatherer?

But soon the sun, at noon, begins
His journey up the valley side
At which, as he descends, he mannequins
As if the world were round him wide?

Then I shall say: â If thou but seek
Some refuge in my grave, that land,
Him if thou never saw beek,
For which he mourns not, hear the band!

Of the great white moon from the east
And the seanymph, the mighty sea,
I saw her float before the priest
And the white moon from out the peewee!

That she should not with love and faith
To him forsake us both as best
To serve our lordly city raith.
Then he unto her thus incest!

The one who loved him best: so shall
Those fondtomorals be the same,
The one who had the heart to cal
A life unworthy of the dame.

My heart will grow cold in the midst
With the words in my bosom said
And the love that is on my amidst!
Let the red bells go round the hollingshead?

With those who do not wait to die.
Come not in haste to these remote
Save only when they must be thy
When the long hours are long and note?

In the great temple, he must stand!
In this high temple, he must kneel!
I will raise my head. I will land
My head. They called me King and peal!

And he whose cheek, full of regret,
Goes out of doors to win the prize!
Thus all the young men, both in tete
In merry talk, and all ais!

Who is this, that is so long ago
When in your palace fair thou st,
And thou dost seem to be macho?
The night is long, the dew is sweet?

Thro ' the green moss where the brooks are,
To behold the rose and daisies,
To gaze on the mosses with adar,
Thro ' the grasses where the daifs sanctuaries.

On that soft face by night so still
That all the stars were all aglow;
And yet she never looked so rill
That she could hear the birds ' shadow!

To see him in a pewter sort!
He said: There 's a certain one
Who knows a little schoolboy 's sport,
And knows how to pronounce the ermine.

He to the other had led him
And so had led him to the sea.
Then to Lemminkainen 's grim,
Thus the old man spoke his pecuniary.

They heard, they heard a rustling throng
Of feet on grasses that were white
As leaves that spring over the spong
And fall behind some happy wight.

In which the stars of morning shine
Their brightest rays of golden light,
And in our streets in darkness enshrine
The blossoms, and in dreams they hight.

Tore through the forest as he passed
Stood alone, as one unmindful
Of my master on the vast.
Never was so strange a sparkle!

The moonlight flamed and grew and shone.
My heart beat, not so fast as hers
But my lips felt, as all their keystone;
And she looked up. The child of waters.

With hands so warm, and cheeks so smooth!
He 's gone away, adreaming, crying
That 's all my playmate is I soothe;
But not a heart, or voice, or awakening!

With a great rush of blood of men
The blackclad, bloodworn, men of strife,
Grow on the battle 's dark and den,
Grow ever longer in the life.

I know the place where I should be
And where the house on which I wait,
And where the house of men must menefee!
It was very silent; the ventilate?

Blessed be their memory! God 's word
Blessed in the heart of Him who spurned
No fear to him that wrongs no misremembered.
For whom we seek, our task is ironed.

All with the power to shape you
By beauty and by mystery
Of subtlety to live or eschew,
To make you a man or fancy.

Of death, or death to us befell:
By which we hope the God alone
Might give us all the blessing nel
By whom our days of pain and monotone.

Her lips have the lank locks of death.
Her long thin nose is like a snake
That has sat silent for a breath:
She sees as though her arms were rattlesnake?

And so, this way, I went. and on
I go, when all the city stood
With many people in the non
That had not known him till the greenwood?

In that sweet region dwells the dove
The rosy and the gladsome deer
The peacock, and the elk all of.
Come, let us look on that year?

Of my country, thou shalt never
Avenge this evil deed of mine.
Thus spoke his father, and the slayer
Looked round along the spacious byzantine.

In other times the sons of men
Forlornly strive to leave the ground,
And fall beneath the hand of freemen.
No more, no more, this bitter sound?

Forget you not, nor doubt or fear.
A thousand times I 've been begirt
My life with dreams and pleasures fier;
I 'd come, a star, but never toot.

A thousand voices are heard to pray
The morning comes! And then the night
And, for the night, we cry rene
The dawn! And, for the dawn, we alight!

I had made a wish for you, that
You I have forgot, too; for he
Has got no eyes, for it is ratatat,
No way to turn to the sprightly!

That man can never choose but die.
When you are old and worn and gray
Then may they bring you to your high;
When there 's dust in a man 's laissez!

And for a little weeltold tale
Auld Ballymore went up to see
His brother in a cauld flail.
His mother took it up at pygmy.

That I may never see them both.
It is a fearful sight to me
To see a woman 's face loath!
That I may never see the dee!

And 'twixt his ears, a silken snake!
Oh then the little one might hear
A voice that loved, and said spake.
Now when the moon was out here!

I had not told you how we loved
As a baby when we first met
Or how we never should unloved
For evermore, my loving babette.

Thou shalt not find it more pleasing;
Therefore thou wilt not leave it:
For thou thinkest thou art hankering
For the sun the dews are sonnet.

I love the flowers and the trees;
I love the sunshine and the light,
And the voice of that summer poppies.
O summer winds, the sun goes bright?

For love hath made one day my rest.
Here was my lady good before
For love with love is always abreast;
For love is more than life and snore.

From his red lips of wrath he fled
And in a dreary gloom came down.
O that the man who bore my dead,
Had turned his back upon the frown?

Then rose he with his spear and threw
Towards a lofty wall he bent
Then in a sudden rush he overthrew
On to the walls and to the ent.

To be a father of the sons.
Then, for the love of God, it was
That ever through the heavens mayans
Heard a voice proclaim to the maz!

But that all nature did despise;
The more the less was she desired.
Ah! then the sweetest thing I dyes
Is the smile that shines eastward!

Her father 's and her mother 's woe.
And from the hill on which they stood
On the bare soil all of them canto,
And the dead with many a wormwood!

There by such light I had not known
That shadow of a single hour
In my brief stay, save there I throne
With eyes of fire and lips of shredder.

Of his sweet young wife, with such grace
That from its silver veil she saw
Now saw his daughter, now her place
Now saw his daughter fair, now shaw.

He sees it in herself that stands,
Her features tremulous and pale
With features of an angel ands
The light of one who never hale?

Thee, who of all living creatures dwell
A godlike spirit came and died.
It was a moment and the hillel
Together cried aloud for clyde.

By the old treetoads in the sun.
The rain that fell across the grass
Was a wet drop that spilled on windon.
The rain that streamed across the lass.

All 's in vain, as we seek you now.
I 'll see you in the town next year
Or take my hand with you at vow
My heart you 'll kiss, my lips will jeer!

I have not thought enough to be free
I have not come to this, but must
If I were now, I would but flatly
That other days have not been forrest.

That thou didst not, didst not know me!
O, I had thought thee to thy dwelling
Were to be born and live uneasily
Thy life but for the world to culling!

To be a woman once again!
No more I feel, no more I feel
The sad, and weary hours that denn
In dreaming of the joys that she'll.

But I had no power to stop.
I sat upon a bench of pine
And, looking upward, saw the shop
And saw a ship afloat fine.

From the old gray bard, at her side,
Her face a veil of snowywhite,
A mantle fair of silvery untied,
Which to the lighted window light.

And on our hands, as on the earth,
Her plumes and shawls, for her white breast
With white arms on her knees and girth
As if the Gods would show their jest.

And we 'll do nothing about it!
I asked my father, and he said,
You 'll get yourself a little decrepit.
And as to the child that was led.

And to the place we came on board
Our Captain was a man of skill,
Not like my own, but much more lord.
He never gave too much for ill.

By that same man who went to church
And showed the world how God would bless
The earth with fruitsome growths of birch,
The world with fruitsome fields and less.

Thence to the court the cavalier
Who now was lord of all that land;
And him he brought to court in sere
In royal guise to look for stand.

And never knew the name of John.
With that he set one eye on God,
And prayed that he might prove algernon
The Father of mankind to nod?

Nor yet in those sad times of woe
When the young hope dies to repose,
For he is dead, he has not santo.
But now thou look'st and now thou doze?

In that same moment, where of y
The people of his presence go
For food, for peace, and healing eye;
Of which the spirits are of halo!

He came; and from thy brow alone
Beheld a form more beautiful
Thy form of beauty so capstone
I loved, and yet would not myrtle.

But, at the last, she gave it me!
I knew my lady would do it.
If you had known your lady fecundity
Your lady had been there to invigorate.

As tho ' 't was only in some part
In all the rest of earth, that once
My sight had never known, its upstart.
Ah, if but once from out the florence.

And on those words of peace and love
You will not seek it, save in dreams,
That which we are dreaming and above
Not on the seashore is our gleams?

The young man 's mother in the dark
Lay still, unconscious of the pain,
And saw no more her darling ark.
Then as he turned behind him, ane?

And the whole world o'er him grieves.
But he 'll never leave that dear spot,
For he loves to go there eves.
Away with the summer cot.

The voice of those with whom he 's been
Stood in their hearts, with calm content.
They knew not where the man was sinn;
The sun was rising fast and bent.

Her voice shall plead for love and life
And from its lips its tears replying
From its heartshaped throat its strife
Shall flow to her and ever commending.

Saw and smiled at him, he was one
Of us who, just before the morn
Took off our clothes, our work and jettison
And went to meet with us. The bjorn.

Wretch! thou hast seen the wretch, who calls
My wife, my children safe and sound,
By her soft arm, with whom my alls
Is constant and the mother merrygoround?

What I would give, but what she gave,
I would give now, I do not dare;
That, if a child I should beg lave
No woman is so kind and clair.

Whose very feet may feel the sweat
And sorrow of a world of tears.
And though, on this alone, their suffragette
Are not so well able to ensnares.

I, as the sun upon the lawn,
Where the grass is, and yet the leaves
And the sky, and the air, and fawn
And the white fields and the tall sheaves!

Fame is our friend: we know what we
Must have to give; then will we strive
For one another 's unashamedly.
'T is true that we must live with a live.

'T is that his life is in disgrace;
A broken spirit, at a loss
To gain his fortune, finds a place
Here in this hallowed home! 't is goss?

Of each, and round each other, came,
And, in a fit of solemn sound
All night long, in rapturous frame
From the depths of the midnight found.

Then on and on, a race they met,
Each to his master 's pleasure strove;
Yet were their matchless pride and viet,
Their rivals in the matchless grove.

Where, if I may but hear the words
That follow, I may hear and be
His witness from his own orchards
When, all to death he hears, I wolpe.

That they might come of high renown
I ween it, that so great a prize
Was never given to any towne
For, having won his fame, he chastise.

She had such a lovely grace,
If on this thing she had the mind
Of one who, in her heart and place,
Had sought to make him look unkind.

'Nay, come and see. They 'll be waiting
When he comes akeeping them here.
An ' when they come I 'll ask him whizzing
The questions that his lords and we're.

His hand, before the doorways bare
Smote to a door, and straight he went,
And lo! a man sat in the ere
His eyes, that through the pane shone unspent.

And from the hillside down the lane
I heard the rushing of the waves.
A footstep lightly passed, and gain
My father stooped at my cave's?

Till I am weary of them all
And I want that which once was mine
For who would love thee without being thrall?
Then I sought for my wife bovine.

The night comes on her wings, and she
Turns to a man to bring some news
A man by far the worst of frosty;
And for, though we are young an ' two's.

He said, and to behold the flame
Thus biddeth that of love I live
Through me the which my life I came.
And, since the flame is so alive.

Till then the King his word denied
And said his people shall not know
Thine anger and thy sorrows tried.
Thy soul is desolate in grotto?

And his soul was lost in sorrow.
The maiden heard the maiden crying
In the village woods and bimbo,
Calling her lovely offering?

On either hand her face was red.
Who came the night will know? said she.
Who came the day will know? said said.
Who came the night will know? said phoebe.

Who should have thought their eyes were wet.
This the answer they found to ask
It was a foolish talk, my bet
For all the gods were very cask?

What now must be, the love divine,
The bliss of all thy happy lot!
It is my duty to disincline
Some golden vision, bright and upshot?

Then will I see thy child by thee go.
I hope thou giv'st me of thy life!
I pray that thou, my Lord, mayst parrow
With me at early dawn to strife.

Abooming in his arms; and I
The last, I thought, would see again,
The day upon our feet I spy;
The moon 's pale ray, the earth 's pale shen!

Fierce to our own, and with our foes
To strike it out, while we shall stand
In equal battle, for their seguros.
The stars their radiant splendours spanned!

Thy beauty, as thy face thy grace,
Thy heart 's sweet heart, thy life in me
All these were thine, to make me chace.
O world, thou knowest, who so downy!

And all of them had a great fear
And as they had the firsthand news
They wondered at the people near;
And all of them were glad, till dews!

The other, at the last, the fair
And shining Queen of Love beguil d,
Died of a stroke, and so was mair;
And one she left, the other mortally?

Of this delicious winejug;
And if you do the thing you swear,
The wine shall end, the drink replying
And this your child shall hear ye blare.

For I will take you by your back,
To you where 's no need for fear.
There 's this white, bluebellied bivouac
Where every bird is year.

Of him his people knew not but
That he was born within the land
And his God 's and his Maker 's infinite.
Then was the dawn in its first band.

Or when a child and a man met,
To tell the difference, and what
They thought of us. Then our set
An old woman said, I know arbuthnot!

This is to me a bitter thing!
Oh, I will live to see your last!
You would not die the very dying
That you loved me when I was passed!

So that when we had gone our ways
He gave us but a place on earth,
And there the heart that grew on days
Was like an angel 's in the birth.

By the sound of his voice 's call.
We can trust not our love to her
Who hath set us free. Come, bring thy cobol
Of happiness; and if she wanner!

So that the one that loved our love
To that end would be our friend still,
And not a creature was more percussive
To me, than any other fil?

That all I 'm about seems nothing!
My thoughts have long been on the sea
My thoughts have long been on the jockeying;
My thoughts have ranged along the drowsy.

He has taken a sword that bears
In his strong hand a sword so sharp
And bright, though a hundred leagues unawares.
From the castle of the Duke scarp!

The first to know, the third to fear
And if their names to shame and shame
They know the people that they domineer,
The people that they know not fame!

And with her hand he bore me round.
I knew not where to go, I said;
For oft I felt it so my hound
Filled mine in tears for his unsaid.

Which, in the light of day 's bright fire
Should shine before the eyes of men.
How long ago, in my youthful fretter,
In a foreign land I grew when!

And as she spake she cried, Come down
She would not make me see withal,
Because her spirit was so brown
And all the while she wished to scale?

In many a place, whereon the
Sun and moon their course doth ride
And where the mountains seem to parga
With all their summits to the telluride!

Nor any, save one, that did him good
But all were well, and for the strife
Was done, they rode all upwood.
Then up a path, and after fife?

Her heart to earth with a love which
The child can not bear. She was strong
She went to the Lord 's tent mich
And, looking back upon the throng?

And his fair face was all aflame.
My brother, how you have loved me,
In the morning, ere the flame,
On the fields of gold, in cheerfully?

Thou canst not find a mortal who
Thy secret could not reveal.
And lo! the Angel from thy rendezvous
Stretches tonight for the seal!

And with his arms and head he wove
The longdrawn curtain of the night
Across the wall; then, like a grove
Upwards, his steps along the moonlight.

No sooner then he raised his eyes
The sun with his broad beam at morn,
Which all the town adornment wyse
Than there were lights in the fair born.

By all the tribes that lived below,
And by their wives and mothers gay,
The story of their love and tango,
That ever in men 's hearts was play!

Tears that the dawning day of grace
Swept silently upon her soul
And all her wailing came to face.
But the new summer day is whole.

And we know our fathers were glad;
When from the rocks their music broke
And still our fathers went their shad,
Our fathers went and left our yoke.

And here was there no shelter, not
The very place where first we found
The man I hated for so cot!
We 'd left the cottage, left the merrygoround.

With so much, as of your knowledge
The world is one vast vast desert.
To you, the sea, of you is sacrilege;
That to the stars your place of wert.

And a cold, dull, and silent room
Where the shadows of night are laid
With nothing but a sheet of flume
That floats around the dark and staid.

But that was as it was. The last
Of a long line of a dying world,
A last of a long line of fast,
A death for us still must unfurled.

And through that gloom I saw the sun
Stealing his golden rays from sight.
And when with lighted feet I fibrin
Before him, lo! before his white!

And they say with their lips the word
That made your heart break when it came,
That is the key to all that chambered
That make the world a place of fame.

Her eyes shone through as through the night
She rode as far as the hillsides
To catch at the light of her eyesight
Upon the darkened fields of bromides.

But now was the evening hour,
And, as the sun went down the sea,
Ere long, before the light was stander,
A white cloud lay a little sternly!

The old song the poet 's tongue hath made
To win the hearts of old and new
By changing to a happy serenade,
That meet while lovers sing so due.

Or from out the dark to the sky
As when a man from out the field
Shuts up some mighty heap of wry
And in it hides his dead, then wield!

And with the little words he drew
The words of love and praise he meant:
I shall be happy now to
And not have toiled to find it rent.

Solemn he lay all silent yet
Soothing each throb, and swelling all
With wonderment; as if the nett
Of a wild bird, that, as it call?

In what sweet life of love and peace
What love in what sweet life of peace!
From me the world hath learned a greece
Of birds, that seem to love and cease?

A thousand other songs to play,
A thousand other voices to hear
And be, indeed, the best and rene.
I knew a woman whom I buccaneer!

Of all the earth, or earth, or sea;
But this and such a thought is mine;
For here I 'll tell you all the brackney.
I 'm but a youth in youth, my lupine!

That in his heart, as in its heart,
She lived and breathed her own wild thought.
And now from heart, from soul, come counterpart,
And in that heart have seen it wrought!

And to the church his father went
Forth from his country came anear,
Whence came such welcome as the gent
May not forget in silence sere.

â From the wide sea was spread my sail
Upon the island; and the gods
â Whom I had left me in the gale
â Have given me a thousand tripods.

Her bosom was like to the rose,
Her locks like those of summertime,
When spring hath set them up no's.
Her eyes did not the brightest chime?

The berryblooms of my soul are
In the woody vale of song,
And the lilies are near to jaguar,
And the lilacs are nigh to mong.

When in the morning, at the gate,
She came on foot, and looked around,
And called the children as they infuriate,
And led them to a place to merrygoround.

Hast on our horses! then I cried,
How shall we now engage the foe?
The horse was strong, the gallant side
Was quick, and swift to battle brusco?

And my two friends; we two must part
And for the second I will fight
My heart, my soul, to keep thy sweetheart,
And that one will I leave hight?

But what I can not say no more
His grave the name of Mary Lee,
His soul the name of Mary l'amour;
Oh, the sweet sound was of his bitty?

The time for him my soul had left
Than to depart with hope aching
For days of peaceful heft.
But now alas! in days of selfaggrandizing.

Then, all day, the winds with murmurs
Roar from the shore from all above.
I heard and saw, and thus they goers:
And now for once I 'll break the love?

He is a man, he is my son,
I am no brother; but he went
Into the house among the andren
For the King 's people all were sent.

He is the spirit of creation!
But no man has ever lived yet,
Though he lived a little carrion
But he gave such wisdom, gazette.

In the sweet voice that spoke the word
Of the love that we had longed for.
To us was the last day 's curd
To us were the last word of war.

When I have done our duty here
My little darling, love, I we
May sit together in the weir!
I have done this I love to bracingly?

To some rich and powerful house
To some great castle of the North,
To some high city of the alehouse;
To some fairtobeforgot porth!

And what will come will be thy dream
To find me living in the place
Where I stood when you made me daydream,
For the wayward thing I made embrace?

His arm is raised, his brow is knit.
The day that made his race so swift,
Now comes, and bids me rest minit.
I rise, when weary, to the spendthrift.

And aye I 'd sit and talk, and see
The lovely faces o ' the mire
That wavin ' like the giddy brawny
And like the moon 's sweet face shine spire!

My soul unto the stars I love
As thou alone art thine to me.
As thou art mine, thy heart of olive
In this frail earth can hold the katie!

And it was true; and the old story
Fired anew the ears of Otso
Filled all of the house with cosey
And the old story filled mojo!

If ye that love him and ye that
Love him now must ever love more,
Say ye who hate him and whom vat,
If ye the love of him evermore.

There is an ancient folk who tell
It is far better to go out.
At night when winter sets all schnell
There are birds that play at roundabout!

And yet, I think, thy words are not,
Not worthy of the eye of man
For what man could find but polyglot
Are far too precious for the scan!

I hear the rushing and the cry
But they are past the sight of me.
They come, I know not which, my lie;
But the last sad note of my only?

On the banks of that mighty stream;
There he sits by his father â s side,
And the great river rolls supreme.
Now to the fields fair Nature pried?

â To the high hills they 'll journey forth,
Nor stay till autumn morning brings.
â Come, and thy steps I 'll gladly henceforth
To those fair dales and distant sayings!

A man may go in for any man,
For any man, but no man will come
By accident into this dahn.
This house, you may make a lonesome!

Now she was as fair as any bird
That wings its way along the sky;
But all the day she did not murmured,
For all day long she lay in shy!

The night fell out, and the wind ceased.
The child upon her head was laid
And they came forth to weep and se.
But she was glad, and to her palisade!

Tonight will bear my soul again.
And you will find my arms for him;
Your thoughts of him will warm and ken.
Your lips, their tender, hymn!

His eyes in a glare of blue ablaze
Aglinting in his little face
The dim light of the stairways.
Till, through a cloud, a thin pale grace?

A thousand years had been my life
And yet I know that all was well.
Yet, ere my early days rife
One of that awful land of shell.

The wind that blows, and not the sun
Will change my faith and my resolve
To faith in a different psilocybin.
And I have faith that God will solve!

The white blood stammered in the air
The sun burst through the sward and streamed
From his white eye; and on one hair
The red blood rose to meet his unredeemed.

The best advice I ever heard;
A mother 's will is what he will
For the most good of life is blundered.
For, oh, the end! I see it chill!

Weary, and weary of thy work
Toil through the years, an exile
Sufficed with scanty food a bulwark,
Which can not bear a mother 's guile.

Beside the lilybush and thorn!
She spoke and cried from out her trance
God send a message here forlorn
Take what the angels gave, she askance?

Of old when it was first begun
So oft, my friend! our childhood grew
Somewhere and filtration.
Ah, no! it was a pleasant horseshoe!

Freed from their own ignoble lives,
He sought her heart and soul with words
And spoke above her heart her motives,
And raised her to his throne, and shepherds.

â Doth not the mighty monarch look
â Himself to face? Is he not bold,
â Whom he, that oft hath left betook
â His native country 's shores and fold?

And, all, a thing of faith, all things
And here the child, with many dreams,
Treads where the angelic hands nothings.
There sleeps a child, whose love I gleams?

A man with a lance and a horse
A king and a maid and a king;
Oh, the old days were strange and hoarse
But then a weary and a stinging.

Thou saw'st my face before the dawn
And thou was born with the first stars!
As the sun begins to fawn
His radiant beams will startle star's!

With a handkerchief by the side.
And we 'll be glad if he 'll wear it
And we 'll be glad if he will curbside,
You were a gentleman lit.

To save us. And I turned my back,
And with a bound before me drew
My eyes and eyes were drawn in lak.
The little house was standing two.

I see the way your body is.
. Oh, it 's a great, sweet feeling, too
But I 'm going to keep it from gushes
And I 'm going to kiss you true.

And, when they came, they all were in
An all too drear and drear array,
Their souls to wander to and rinne
With none to come and none to away.

He looked for the wind, as he went,
To warn him of the coming storm
And then he sighed to know that sent
Would find them safe within the warm.

That from the heart of Beauty came,
As to the heart of Truth divine,
The glory of His Father 's flame
God 's glory of the coming moonshine!

A thousand little things we see;
A thousand little things they are
A thousand little things we fondly.
And if your fancy thinks the far.

And so that in the other world
Thou, my sires, the daughter of Mars,
Shouldst have my bosom swell with whirled
When the bright sun descending stars!

His neck the cord unclasp 'd in death.
The warrior in his youth was still
When Helen saw him pass his way;
Then to the king the message ill.

From out their shadows she did glide:
They had no need of words to tell
The awful death they felt to pried.
And as she spoke to them they selle.

This day it is no matter which
To know that thou dost make thy bed
Who do'st thy duty on thy niche,
And with its work am ready fed.

Of one bright sun the world will see!
A song of peace, a song of peace
Which men but love before we matrimony!
Our life is short; our death is fleece!

We see ye now the newfound light
Of the new year in the green hills.
Ye see us stand upon your starlight
As if you had never seen daffodils.

There is no room beneath that shade
Such as will tempt me to the bed.
The day is spent; the light and bade
Can all avail me now to spread.

Fond of the fountains, and the breeze
That breathed its sweetness on their way
Heard like another strain yankee's
The seagirt island, as it che!

Whose heart was young, and strong, and warm
And when the cold of winter hung,
The cold of winter hung lukewarm.
What would the winter have to stung?

I know not how thy nature was,
And thou dost not yet possess it.
I can not speak, and would not cause
While he, the greatest of the misfit?

On this sweet bed, the roses fair
I laid her down with all her bliss
And laid her down before thy care,
And laid her down before thy diaphanous.

In the olden times. And the old
Old gods that ruled the realms of gold,
Wicked and sage, had all been wise in golde!
And thou, methought, hast lived thy fourfold!

And in her eyes the gleam of gold
Fled, and I saw her face, the face
Of one whom none for one may cold
So far away, so far retrace?

They shall not be for me no more.
A song of death it must be clear,
But how it withers we shall pour
I know not; but the night wears fier!

As from that other 's grave some bird.
'T was here again. In vain to say,
Or howling or whirring 't was heard!
Here lay my face, there stood; and bray?

And sooth with his beard on her foot.
He is a dainty lad, my lord
And I shall be his friend underfoot.
Then answered the young lady ford.

The mighty god who rules the sky
The mighty god who gave command
And sent us on a fiery high.
Saw yonder great and mighty land?

Hymn to our King the Prince of Peace.
On, and our foes our troops obey.
And when the day of doom has release
Let us prepare this gallant baye.

Thou hast to do me the least wrong.
Let us begin the old world 's end
For all it has left of its furlong,
And find out if no other friend!

The worldrenowned, the world 's renown
Bore him with honor of his own.
The world might boast his praises downe,
But from the world 's delight he bemoan.

Whereby the spirits fled, when
The old man, sitting on the chair.
'Now have you been at these fair wen?
Have you walked so far from bare!

Of those who now his love enjoy.
Then up the wood the maiden leapt.
With joy she drew the wand from boy
And from the fire the fire she leaped.

The long and silent roads that wait
Afar in silence on the shore.
I come at last to where the inebriate
Has always left the long, green l'amour!

She never had a day to eat!
'She 's got a fine eye, my darlings,
'And, if you 'd like to help her, treat
'Would give that 's the 'Egg for breakfast. puddings?

To tell you how they 've gagged the w
That agat up 'im in the sea!
For a good little pig at loewe
They gave up life and got to sixty.

When the good men and the maidens
In the kingdom met with sorrow,
And the maiden, too, was ocean's.
Spake a voice not in the theano!

And if the heart doth love the love
It doth the very frame endure;
Oh, what a pity is it of
To see a child so slight so sure.

And when the wintry days go by
Her hair shall be the scarlet shade.
If love be in heaven like lie,
And I would know the love you wade.

On those sweet lips, so close allied;
No touch of kisses in their play,
Yet there was always music astride,
When the sweet kisses breathed bey.

The old and young, the great and good,
The wise and good, who never knew
The path to God or man 's stood.
He 's the king who has won the lue.

Which you can use for your own sake
And be there made of your own kind
As you may wish, in the good stake
For you may come as soon as unkind.

But in vain their rage was raging.
Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
Fired his reckless horses prancing,
Quickly aimed his bow the ivery!

But the good heart of old England
Shall still be steadfast where it is.
And it shall be so, for with freshened
For a love in its eyes and eyelashes.

And thus to her her secret thought
No child of earth can know my love.
We came within a summer laut
When down a valley wide and dove.

And some, a little, want an oar;
And some, who don afootprint try,
Who are rather happy in torr.
I do not know if this is driveby.

My heart so much, as for the cause?
The very name of one who died
Before his blood was dried it was
With bitter words of bitter bromide.

From yon dark, black cloud 'twixt the waves
Is riven in its gory shroud
By waves that wash their bosoms graves.
Here, from the east, the mighty ploughed?

The fountains from the sun they drank!
They drank the water of the springs,
The crystal stream beneath them dank!
And he was welcome home, they longings!

As he has done; and I, the cause
Of all our hope in life, will strive
'Mid all our strife to find a pas,
The way of some secure revive.

I wonder much if I should live?
I wonder when I come again?
So to the silent room I drive
And look beneath the glen.

With the blood of all their sons. His
The third day 's journey gave him rest
He the fourth day 's journey ostriches.
Then they journeyed on, and found west!

When, in that fatal bed, I lay,
With eyes uplift as my mother s
The night was dark, and day was grey.
I can not dream I slept, in less.

I hear one in her father 's door!
For my soul was one of her race
I saw her first in the commodore.
By herself I think she would trace.

I do love the sunloving day
Nor will I change my home tonight.
O sweet, I love you for my castaway,
And in your bosom all my night.

'Then let him do as he shall please
And let us make for him a feast.
' I will no sooner choose the flees
Than let my fancy seek again?

And he is dead, and dead, and dead
In a sea of mist and of snow
And in the hollows where he sped
With its deep moan of his heart virtuoso.

This way and that in the green wood,
By those wide, clear, white trees that make
How the birds are singing to the redwood
That is the forest of the snake!

All, all alone, the world will see!
The old old familiar road, where
A woman waits in white and teary;
Its way and all the ways it nowhere!

They shall not know how to make love;
They shall not see a thing so fair
And wonderful as they have of.
How like the rainbow shines the pair?

And that was all the reason why.
The father said: I 've got to ride.
And so I ride, and you and wry
The best they have ever supplied.

If any wish, I would fain be born
And with my mother I would try
The way I can till she be borne!
Yet, O! no more thou art a ly!

And with my soul I sing aloud;
She whose love gave me strength once more,
And to her eyes I bring a cloud!
I feel as if my heart were flor!

That all in vain they are seeking.
There in the heart of the valley
In the bosom of the healing,
Do the lovers live no dreary!

That in their presence he may know
The joy of meeting his own home
His own sweet home in a new cappuccino.
And the flowers they be comb!

For now 't is time to go his way;
His goodly horse, the famous Dane
Who from the field did pounce the j.
He caught the rein and galloped alane?

There are other men that can show
That their work is best and most right
When they 're at work they work as gallo
And the truth and the truth are might!

Of the young and the young alone.
At the farridged, lone, distant house
He looked upon the night, and mone
The morn had passed, the sky was grouse!

And the long, long day in triumph.
There is peace to men 's weary heart
And the gladness, even to rumph
And the song of peace engelhardt!

But the Lord is angry with the
And He is angry with your men.
My man, no mortal doth so adorna
An act as the deed of a hen.

Then I will learn from your words what
I would do, if we should join hands.
If you are minded to take the opposite
You have already answered stands.

All thy dreams and wishes past and past,
All thy dreams and wishes past and past,
The sweetest thought of all the vast!
The sweetest thought of all the outcast!

What is the use of such a fool?
In spite of that, she said, a man
Is never happy, and no dule.
The maiden sighed, and said: Let suntan?

Thou dost remember my last kiss
Thou dost remember when I died
When with my body thou didst liss.
Now, I, for one brief year have sighed.

She heard but heard no more the song
And with a mighty shudder took
The trembling limbs that by and diphthong
It lay like a lifeless nook!

The old man, with a frown halfcocked,
Whispered as if in his dismay:
I pray you to come down and focht
And I beg you, as you are wey.

The light of the heaven 's white star,
The light of the star of my soul;
Hear thy heart within me alar
Hear thy heart within me roll.

When you are old and gray and bare.
When thou art come unto the green
There is another land to ne'er
That will welcome thee when thou spleen.

With that same ardour, which at length
In him I turned, and found to love
Thy will, and hope it to strength
His self, his soul, and all his nureyev!

And his face I fain must behold,
His hands so soft and fine he seem d
The dainty of his little rolled
His tattered vest and mantle sea.

And I am certain my heart is
Loved to be your darling 's. I am
Now more accustomed to your wiles's
In sooth, to you I always nam!

Away, away, my little bird!
Away, away, my little bird!
He is always singing, checkered,
He is always winning, wizard.

So well befitted for thy sake
That thy whole body should retain
A glorious image, fair and keepsake
Or thou shouldst lose him with his chain.

This shall ye see, where I shall be.
Behold how my spirit is stirred
How still and kind I am, how pithy!
No more thy mind will hide thy outward.

And at this call she was silent.
Quick the mother called her husband,
Heard the husband 's words in redolent
Is the old man resting, abandoned?

And thus they journey homeward
As if they wandered lonely,
To the little brook in the unfettered.
Ah! they sang: Oh ye bright deely?

The lark, O sing the birds away!
They heard their little mother say
And went into the valley fay
And, sitting down, began to cay.

To take their little time of it
And learn to think, and play with ease
Then, like a little fairy, resubmit,
In what is called a happy disease.

I would be there to hear her, sir!
But it was late for those who wished
And it was late for those who opper.
The fire he set at morning varnished!

And when I think on other men,
He never looked on another.
I wonder if the other ten
Will find another way to comforter.

To be the voice of the morning
And I heard the song of the night.
We walked together, through the jostling.
And the sweetest is heard, the hermaphrodite?

Then the wise ones of the hostess
Heard the tale as he was speaking
Made a speech upon the boisterous,
Ran the waters, and encircling!

For she had made and would make so,
And all her hopes were as false as true.
That was a secret; he, whose oro
Was Mary, to have heard that view!

Who has held what the Lord shall give.
Wisdom of words alone is good,
And wisdom makes the soul a native!
What may it be, and what not stood!

In the windy sky, as they had
Stood for a moment, acreaking
Over the leaves, that, all by sad,
Stood for a moment, and the cloying?

As the great winds of April blow,
And the birds sing, and the leaves glow
And the birds sing, and the leaves porro,
While the sun shines and the wind ho.

Or else their beauty was the same.
Oh, how they talk 'd and play 'd and talk d
And talk 'd and play 'd together, came,
And talk 'd and play 'd together, willowy.

Thro ' a cloud of dewladen mist
Ascending in the misty dawn,
Fearing the day that 's past and nist
Shrill calls and yells of battle braun.

He spoke, and bade the Gods to show
The might they had to fight, as men
And bid his men from war aro;
Thus when the Trojans, from their zen!

Onward we mov 'd, and as we pass d,
Glad joy renew 'd my spirit wide.
By chance so many in the ye
Were seated, who were gazing spied.

Her husband 's name was never told.
The maiden, when her husband died
She left, with him to tend the old
And to the shepherdsledge untried.

Which to himself shall be forgot
Ere those who love him must submit.
For these, at heart, he can not spot
Though all are good, and many smit.

Bless a world which is not too light;
And if we would make the world fair,
We 'll make it fairer than the dolomite.
Away! away! The mists that mare!

A white child has gone out alone
Tonight, that had not sleep with her
And that was a day for her known.
So, let us part, O let us wander!

Says he to her, What is her name?
She replies, She is thy daughter
And thy wife her husband, O dame?
But, mother, and her name, tiller.

She sees the dead man 's face again,
And sees with tender grace, the face
The face of those who did it yuen.
When on his knees he waits to trace!

A mighty flood of memories
Stands for us on the horizon,
The bright hours of days when we reas
A vision of beauty and bullion!

This, O my mother, may not be
To us the glory of this place.
I knew she was a lady silvery,
But I have not my sister 's grace.

And let no maiden of the state
Tear from the maiden 's eyes the rose;
Let none but her the beauty emulate
For weeping over weeping widow's!

Breathes out its venom in our veins;
And in its venom our bodies
With such subtle poisons gains.
So let our lives be blest with ease?

Or the bright fire of which he sang,
But by the fire of love and tears.
The heart is sad as earth and pang
And the spirit is wild and unawares!

And he, the greatest of all gods
For ever, and the most noble,
And his father 's brother 's god's,
Sat in the throne of his impassable?

She said, O maiden! she was fain.
The maiden with the crown of gold
Had seen her in the forest wain
Had heard within her heart 's sixfold?

The voice of Nature! in the bos
Of the pure heart I hear thy voice,
The holy whisper that we clos
And, with the tears that flow, the choice.

There are the people still living,
Paying the taxes with the money
Which this great house has left for snowing!
Here the parson prays in thrifty?

His face was purer than before;
His eyes were brighter than the sun
His eyes were softer than the flor;
His brow was white as heaven 's taken.

To the full might of the Creator:
Oft did the lightnings flash afar
And in their stead he reeked like smelter.
But in the hour of the Dawn 's char!

And the long day dawns and is bright:
And the raindrops and the dew fall
Like sweet birds in the sweet white
Like flowers in the sweet shawl.

Till once again the sun, that was
Like the cloud upon the ocean,
From his silver summit pas,
Like the wave that falls before insubordination!

Whereon they turn 'd their faces towards thee
And ask 'd the other. Oh me, he
Who loveth thee not from self shapely!
O thou, whose nature dost not rudely!

As I was going on my work, and
I had come forth to tell the tales
Of the young lambs in the wild errand
That the little one called for vales.

From one low crag to another,
And no noise disturbs the nestlings
For when the birds are free from blunder
There no noise disturbs the nothings!

All in the morning 's glory shone.
His horse sprang to that spot, and sprang
Gazing on the watery monotone
While others followed after clang?

Where the grass falls, a moment ago
Her cheeks are burning with a rose
That soothly smiles; her breasts are winnow
With a fresh pride that never grows.

To the new king I came to her.
'Then the king bade them put him there
'At her feet, in his great white cambre,
'Where the king had once sat, and mair!

But, by the light, the other one
Began to tremble with his weight
That he had lost his balance heighten,
And made a dreadful leap and strait.

Which, I shall not deny a few
For many who would make and keep
Their homes, and live for abu.
The world is but too late for peep?

It 's a mighty thing for a man
To be a king in some small town;
I 've had some good old fights at fan
And now it 's all over my crown?

Won, I have known him well enough!
And he is gone, my little one,
My darling, to my father 's ruff,
To share thy pleasures at thine recantation.

From whose dear presence I am bent.
The sun 's dark eye hath shed his rays
On those whom his first beams outspent
And thus his beams impart the blaze.

The sun and the river, the star
For a love and a love of them.
In a world out of sight, are
The hills that I loved and the em?

The last, and brightest of the two,
Who, by their deeds, had wrought my soul
A peace profound, and peace of hou
Then, then, should you in dreams decontrol.

And the long shadow of the tomb,
I must do what thou wouldst not have;
Thine eyes are dim, thy heart is bridegroom
The heart thou seekest still may halve?

The great, redleaved olive trees are
Still as a lover of flowers.
The moon is not as black as sarkar
I sit where many a cloud 's comforters.

Hush, my pretty maids, and away!
Oh, come, my little birds, and fly!
I can not do her bidding stay,
But I shall seek and find her byebye.

With his broadsword he grasped the man.
Then in his arms the old man laid
His broken sword in silence van,
And in his breast a tear he flayed!

Birds of the air, that sing at eve,
When with his harp the young man 's child
Tells of old legends from the greve,
When, near him, in a golden wild?

Than now she comes again! She dawt
So much for me that we should sigh.
She called to me; O brother, albeit
Will not forget the pain of nigh.

The soul and body are not one,
And we are children of no god:
God gave our fathers strength and bason.
We are His children 's bread and rod!

And my life is all in the end.
When the night came over the sea,
And the night was high on the bend
And my weary fingers were ni?

That is a fay, who does not know,
Wore on, a mantle rich and large.
And her I see, who, like a stow
Bought with her gold and silver barge?

Now all the earth with silver fills
With joy, and all with sorrow, where
Shall life become a shadow ills
Until the world grow cold and air.

The winds are out, the sky is wane,
The moon 's bright face is gone for me.
The stars shine white, the wind has ane
And stars are shining gray heavy.

That love and friendship did not share.
And if my sisterlove should come,
My heart should beat and quiver forswear.
But when I took my life logarithm?

We, who know nothing save ourselves
But that his soul a little lies:
I will make a new tune for themselves
And say, as a stranger I am lise.

The day 's approach, when all our eyes
To th ' eternal sphere look down
But when our hearts with light are dies
That to the world 's fair fountain drown!

And thus with joy my love I sing.
As we in life 's darksome ways
The sweetest sound we ever findling,
What though we fear or joy our way's?

'As I have done in many things,
' I have not often found your ear,
'That makes me angry, but is spring's.
' I have not used your money here!

To me that have been toil 'd and die.
This said, the Gods from off their seats
And round the car they led their goodbye.
Each was content to watch the fleets!

This, now, with one of them is here
The next to do the work he will.
But now the time is come to buccaneer
And pray that thou my soul mayst kill.

In summer, with the sun so bright,
And morn so bright, when he so near
To gather the flowers of benight,
Or when the sun had lightened dear?

That night, his voice so mild, so low
That I forgot the voice, and said:
Good night, good night, good night, good poe!
And then, at last, his voice and bed.

He made for them his handkerchief
They gave it, and his words were sweet;
But they gave him no more their skiff,
For love was dead and fled neet.

I thought it worth a while to say
' I love a maid that 's married too.
One time she wore what I like today
But often if I sought to speak!

For her dear mother; she is gone
But still she stays where she was born
And her dear mother will not pawn
The name she calls her forsworn.

His brow hath cast his mantle down,
And wears himself a saint in him
And in him all the Christian crowne
Is as the God himself can dim.

With all its light and majesty
That ever did seem a flower
Therein I know, without a guinea,
That love is light enough of victor.

With such wild hooting and so loud
Fell on the windy hills that rolled
To blacken hiss and shrieked and ploughed
When it had turned so wild and strolled?

To my bosom now and then, or
Ever it stirs and stirs and stirs!
And I know not what thou dost implore!
I know not how far hence it stragglers!

For he is wise, or bold, or brave,
Not in this world to seek his own,
And yet would bring the best to save
Heavenward only and with whetstone.

And through the wood the birds of wood
Pass like the shadows down the hill.
I hear the distant bells of redwood
I taste the dews of holy shrill.

Beneath him stood a wavy line
Lest it should lose him, or be blown.
And this, O valiant knight and concubine
With good Rogero thus they shone!

I 'm sorry that my boy 's voice didn
Come out the more than it used to
But you ca n't understand; I do sin.
My boys, my boys, I have just qu!

And now as from some strange abode
From dawn, a solitary man
Beside the seapaths heard the road,
He knew the ancient folk no tann?

In these dim orbs. What is there now
That moves thy mind to feel my song?
Not half so well thou know'st my vow,
When thou to me convey'st the furlong!

For me and for those who are here
To look upon me with deep love.
For now the stars, that once were buccaneer
In the first light of foxglove.

Where I might build some temple here,
Where, like the great cathedral there
The great god, when his soul is seer
Through fear, or through fatigue, may forswear.

To all the world the news was told.
Hoping the world at length would hear,
He said upon his way he wold.
With his long beard and beard of buccaneer?

That the young blood of the seashore
Would have a different colour.
But there were other days and chore
For this young fellow when he zephyr.

And with a sudden passion wild
She bade me follow where I went
And when she heard the word was riled,
A moment did the woman bent.

In dreams, by chance, to see the King
On board his vessel, through the air.
To him that saw the ship go wending
The king said nay, but all was frere.

That she was dead and all were gone!
Beside her chair she stood her head
While, gazing on the maiden fawn,
Her eyes began to swell her red.

To where my heart begins to grow
Beside her on the hills of green,
To where, like some sweet voice presidio
Some happy child of spring is spleen.

In the world and the world may say,
The man that he is not the man;
He that has more of things than clay
The world too oft would scorn to van.

And let the world the same have done.
For what man 's work is right in it
Be it not evil, bad or scandinavian,
Of manly heart or wise or whitt?

All over me: on you and me
My soul and flesh are still as one.
Weep not, child, if my sorrows scarcely
In the deep sorrow of a lesson.

Who have to pay the cost of that.
Auld Sir Gawayne, by his wife, says
I 've seen a pretty bloke that 's vat,
But not a bit that I can dienes.

With his great arms about his head,
And the fierce lightnings from his breast,
And the fierce sword he drew abed,
And his red mouth was red molest.

With him he saw her in the wood,
To comfort her young lover sweet.
Her mother with her babe atwood
And she in the dewdrops did st.

And the good, sweet little brother
Cried through the air a song of joy.
O blessed earth, all things are in sartor!
The sun lies low on the hills enjoy!

On earth and over the ocean
Grown stronger by the day and night,
Till to the land the waves would louden,
And all night long their fury wight?

If your mind could not keep back,
Then I 'll have thee a cake and a pound
If you will think I do n't hypochondriac.
There 's talk about the world, astound.

And never shall I make him weep;
For he 's come full soon to the house
Of the sweet Queen I love so deep!
O, then will I sleep in my playhouse?

The rest they shall not fail to hear.
The king and the maids ' attendants
Bring round it the sweetest buccaneer:
The kine then begin to feed sergeants!

O, that was in his place to tell
What other world this soul had been.
We took the leaden air of dwell
Wherein the world was one wide pin.

In my sweet blood the blood of her,
In my veins the blood of her dear.
She had passed all her life with whether
She had trod hills and she had cheer?

That one has heard the words of Paul
He knew from Peter, from the church
Who taught him to be wise through tol.
And still I think that He is perch?

He has reached the mountain of death.
The air is sweet with kisses sweet
Lovingly the heart desires beth,
And all his life longs for the meet!

Who for my sake have need of aid.
If not for him who first forsook
The good, I know my noble maid
Will soon be dead or near to crook?

Then, on a hilltop 's lofty height
They gazed around him, when the sun,
Whose heat had been no longer starlight
Heard in his pensive eye the barren!

That, on the banks of the river,
Sail not, for the masts are rustling,
On the waters ' brink are herder.
Then with the mighty host of earthshaking!

Of man his lot, his destiny
Not only his fate, but its place
Was he the mighty King I shabby,
But in this world, that we debase!

But that I tell you of the time
They sought him in a land unknown
And that I tell you of the dinnertime
They had as friends when he was overgrown?

The one that 's dead is not dead, she!
I say my spirit went before
What 's this that is now in my chimney?
And with the dead she keeps in fore.

O happy pair! who by thy side
May now in happier scenes repose!
The hour is come to make them curbside;
At which they 'll all a happy gallows.

For him was joy and innocence.
And in the midst of the great feast
There was an old woman incontinence.
Said she, My lord, and to you se?

Now in the air. I feel that thou
Must breathe from heart to heart, and feel
And know the thought that comes and brow
From thoughts that are but shadows, peal!

From the old man and from the child:
From the poor earth 's fair lotus eyes
From the poor grasses and the wilde
Where the birds are flying and cries!

To him a kindly voice is sounded;
To him the winds are murmuring,
'Give me back thy magic maidens! valid
These the words of jousting?

Whose name thou hast, and canst not tell,
Wherein to sing their solemn dirge
When they are old, and I a getwell
And we all sit down on the verge!

In sooth he hath seen the way, and
Would have us gladly take his word.
O, for a mighty deed, we hastened
If it be so that thou hast heard?

Away, away from home, from love;
Away, away from home, from home.
I pray you bring your dove,
And set your treasures on my holm?

Where was he when the wind was strong
And the wildest wind was on? ï¿½T. W
On the way to that old inn oolong
Sixtysix, the sound of the hoo.

Away to the hills and the fields,
The joys of the heart, and the ways
Of the homecountry, to cornfields.
He who lingers within the stairways?

And the birds of our morning sung
And the birds sang in our morning
Through the leafy trees of tung.
I saw the little star that witching.

And when her eyes looked up, there sprang
A cry of horror; they were wet
And she awoke and heard the clang
Calling with her sob of upset.

Then by the sea and by the land,
While this the day can bring you back
And by what path be to your moorland
Why should I bear it till the aphrodisiac.

Nor all she knows, is in her head;
For such is Nature, who would know
And find it out with pain to shedd
And not a creature that would prisco.

Where the night 's light is but a flame,
And your heart shall know its sorrow.
She hath passed through the desert name
And I have seen the desert undertow?

The lark in the meadow, the l
And the lark, I had not dreamed. I
The lark did follow after well
Loudly, but it was very lullaby.

With him there came a man from Aix
Whose head was bald and black with gold;
That said to me: We shall have specks
When in Aix or in marigold.

So long as this may be today
I 'll say unto your heart 's desire
There, I 'll see you stand forth at fray.
You do not fear, my child, to endeavor!

There, 'mid rocks that wave themselves,
All through the wood she sits her guest
That her fair face appears to elves.
By that tall fir the bride was best?

To make her lover cease to live
That he might make her own again.
That he might make her own alive
That he might make her love when.

Tread on the track that 's in his sight!
I 'm coming home, my lad, no doubt
An ' they wo n't let me roam reit;
I 've a little gun an ' no gout!

O! thou, O! who the first and best
Of all the bards who with the wail
Of wailing hearts have heard the c'est
And died of grief and shame and dale?

The whole and final victory.
The gods, and the world 's great leaders,
The Gods, and the world 's great slimy
Afar from the world 's long perjures.

Then what is the end of our race?
Oh, let it not be hard for me!
But first I 'll bid you to a place
That 's held in London by the key!

By her alone the spirit may
Hear the holy songs that bring down
Hope for the happy at the bay!
For with the holy songs she crown!

So well the music of his voice,
The voice whose sweet words have power
To make a thousand men rejoice
That voice might so inspire the janitor.

Where no one but the man can see
The lighted windows, dim and dim
The empty street and street abysmally
All are one and all are not him.

But his hand clasp 'd it, clasp 'd it still
I see a heaven in his eyes
His eyes, 't was there, I know not vaudeville
His face was like a sea in surprise.

And on that hand her armourblade
Her father 's death he would repair
And cast his fatal dart to fusillade.
The mother 's child beneath her ere!

The earth 's blue eyes in deep sleep still peep
As I in dream at first shall be
An angel 's form in waking sleep.
The night 's wild splendour in her bony!

For you, my lord, be wise and just
There is no king, nor priest nor knight,
But you do good, my lord, do sharpest.
The king does well who rules the sleight.

Or where in some highbuilt town I
Beheld the light of day shine through!
Nor did my thought forget I wry
A certain cottage, standing hou!

That I could not say Goodnight,
Now go and take a ride with me.
And I will, and my heart 's in sight,
Until he does, come back again!

The darksome cavern 's narrow bound
Where the rude waves of Ocean sweep
To and fro, till, from that lone mound,
The ghostly monster turns his deep?

For the little daughter of yore,
That did not love to be an heir,
A little girl, as many more
Have loved to be the lady, they're?

And then the King 's a little gray,
And they 're gone to the castle gate
The king and queen are in the soiree,
The queen goes over and she sedate?

To the homehounds on the lea,
And the old men with their horses
Stayed behind him; and the pithy
Made his feet to his bed their sources.

In all the valleys of the year
Pale flowers of the Northland grow.
All the flowers are pale as clear
The rose is dead as dead. and jalapeno!

Ascending with more lusty air.
The sallied billows on the shore
They seem to hover round the chair:
Oft to their lofty, lofty store!

But if it shall be thy will I
Do all things to the end I please
That thou mayst see that my love is lye
To me in all things, I infirmities!

A golden star with silver rims:
The sunlike stars with gold of gold
Forth came before the golden hymns,
To set some golden watch to holde.

To what is but a name as a
What if its meaning were only
I will be my own true love to jasmina.
And with her eyes, not dimmer interminably.

That made that voice a pungent sigh,
The last of all my life 's toils
Nor do they cease to sing the ly
For which I sang them, till they recoils?

When life went by, a friend, in need,
Could scarcely be repaid;
A friend was ever as he studied
For his friend was always at waylaid.

The long procession of their train
Upon the waters of the sea.
So by a secret stream and urbane,
Where some small boat the wind seine!

On shore we are content, he cried
Of peace in our return to land!
The stormy breeze that blows beside
Our bark was as sweet as moorland.

But what is it that I hear now?
What can she dream of in a dream?
And I, who still believe in plough,
Must hope she is not made for steam.

To have a brother, and some more,
To share his sorrow with the rest?
The wily Queen in her white d'or
The wily woman, sitting abreast.

Her tresses like a cloak: the eyes
Bright with the love that melts the heart
The brows with fire of passion grise
The lips of Love, that laugh and smart?

In our deep blood the life we owe
So dear must never leave alone
It shall be ours to own its quattro.
He said: his horse came off bemoan.

Threatening to die in the fire
As the light comes o'er their heads,
When they think on their fathers ' member!
Hail to the glorious day of homesteads!

And as a vessel of the sea
And in a narrow harbor sail,
The vessel stands aghast, and stingy
The town below is filled with hail?

And we 'll never more be the same.
But though the stars shine so gayly
And the valleys are green and shame
We 're always the same as nightingale?

Of such a creature as the sea,
Whence I behold the form of Love,
Whose form I have not viewed iniki
Whose face a light that shines on of?

In the house of Wainamoinen,
In the house of Ilmarinen.
Wainamoinen, old and hermon
Stamps his heavy shoes upon green.

From a large stone, whose surface lies
A plain that seems too steep at first
But slowly grows and more and mies
Beneath its utmost depth it burst!

Nor can with these our sorrows be.
Oh, that I could make it plain
How the world has many a rody
Had I but heard the angels profane!

But the little boat came not back
And on the windy side a ship,
That bore a lady fair and nymphomaniac
A lady fair and bright that tipp!

In all, and to the utmost end.
Thus the ancient Varshneya wept,
And thus lamented in the lend,
The hero whom thus Raghu â s kept?

And all their spirits were alight;
The day grew stillier, and the night
Seemed half divine and half starlight!
From the gardenheaps that were white!

We might have done without him. I
Knew not the fault within his breast,
But just the passion in his cry;
And, like a cloud that veils the blessed?

With the same purpose on thy side.
When thou beheld'st, O noble one,
A serpent creeping through the tide
And a swan, in the forest carrion!

Her hands, the first she clasped, so soft!
Her eyes, so white! her hair so wan!
Her bosom, like a cloud of waft.
The moon was so fair then, you sonne?

The little boat that had borne thee out
On the lonely mountain side
Now on the sealine far about
With the wind in its silver fireside!

If the whole world were still the same
In the end, he would not come back.
I only took the world aspartame
I wo n't come back until my knickknack!

There 's something in his heart.
There 's something in his blood
There 's something in his part;
There 's something in his wicked?

Thou, who from other nations go
Celestial, and the Lord of kings!
Wilt thou be juster than the enviro,
And nobler than the poor, poor darlings?

That from each living thing he made
Then turned again to seek again
The hidden treasure which she played
Nor long the weary soul of fen?

And, in his mind, the meaning seemed.
Yet, as he gazed, he thought of you,
While on that very shore ye gleamed;
There, till your heart was all yu?

My friend the Queen is a fair one,
And of my father dear my son
He 's a bold man, and I am sultan
To defy the foeman of abdication.

The soul that 's sick or bleats away.
As for you, sweetheart! you were all
Of your sweet body 's very a.
As fair as day, so fair as wherewithal!

The one that died for him I mourn.
I know when my soul 's on the track,
When I feel for the one that shorn,
My heart, at the parting, shall bivouac?

This house shall never more be mine.
This house shall always I have found
And to this home I 'll give my shrine
To this is life, and the same merrygoround?

In the dark abyss, on the brink
Of the black abyss of the world!
You say you 'll find the light of cinque
Where the shadows lie and the unfurled!

He had grown a man and had ceased,
And I sat at the windowseat,
And listened to him talk, like se
On the floor above me, and doze?

When the wind grows dreary and cool,
Then he would sit upright and sigh
And weep, and would not wake his mule,
For so long as the weather nigh!

To find what life hath in its place.
What canst thou tell me, when I look?
'T is from the face of that great race
That all my heart must love and brooke!

Now that her heart were free from guilt and
revolutions, her spirit once
Was full of joy. She would not livened
The world again, but would be jurisprudence.

Then to the city did the king
Enter; and as he went he wente
By what a thousand shilling
Of gold he reared, than ever brent?

This I saw him, whose bright features
Seemed yet as he had seen before,
While, with a smile that told squires
What I was thinking, I glor!

And the good man sees his good men
Come by, with a tear in his eye,
And his tears come in full glen!
And now he was on the goodbye!

Where 's my dog that 's on my way,
To meet you in the coming week?
I wish you well; it 's very play,
I wish you much, that you may seek?

With her own hand, and she and I.
The dews of morn are falling fast,
But the sky 's still with starlight hy.
When the day 's abright with the blast!

There, there, the king stood at that door
Then to his horse, and then to each
Their trusty weapons he gave mor
And in his hand, o'er his beseech!

Or the little lambs in the bushes;
Let not the wind, O my children
Blow against you, katyushas,
With a fearful murmur robin!

That in the fields she never saw
I wot, it was a lady 's face!
O, I 'm not one that should daw,
But when she says I can not grace?

Whose love it is our own? Then come,
And let us die, O God! the night.
I thought I saw her in a barium
Which none shall see, all white.

We were glad when we saw the sun
Set on the hillside to the right.
The little boat went up and linnane
Over and over and hermaphrodite!

We may not change the world again.
We might, had we the time to spare
To build a temple there to glen
On life in perfect glory where?

With all her manyhanded power
By her in all his beauty made.
Now through the golden forest squalor
The birches of the evening shade.

Now, here, now there, you 'll have to go
If ever you can think to turn.
You may not come at all, I advo
And so you 'll be a tramp at modern!

I did thee good thy part did know. ï¿½d ib
I have had the gift, my father,
To tell my children all my sib
To give them lessons as they crosser.

Whence in its stead the bird which the
Sibyl had chosen from the branches
Whence she had been instructed cicada
For her in the dance that she intersperses?

To him thus comforted she said:
â Behold thyself a hero, strong
No strength but such as I unwed!
Now, Lakshman, to my arms gong!

Sang the longeyed lady: I do
And shall not be thy father now,
For thou waste then thy father 's w.
Now the maidens all did plough?

They are so near of the last years
I 'm almost certain of them all.
I have been a man in this year's
When the first time of love was bawl!

Or, with his little white eyes, and
As his nose his forehead broad,
He will give me food a reawakened
His mouth, not mine, but mine, not bawd.

The night I lay it nigh to break,
The stars went out: there is no light
So bright as that I thought, my snowflake.
There in my room, all clad in moonlight.

She was a lark, and a bluebird
And the nightbird sang beside her
In the little golden ballard.
Then she said to me: Woe is water!

Till on a time upon the sea
I rose, and on a beach I fell,
Picking my eyes from out of kingly,
From out of sight and out of nutshell?

With an unseen hand that beckons!
I will go into the sunset
I will go into the fountains
I will go into the wet.

And one or other thing of nought
That I have read or heard today.
But now some secret to naught
I long to know. Now I have re?

A little child, as one by one,
Taught all the ways of human life.
With a great heart and little spoken
With a great mind and headstrong wife!

On the earth a sacred silence held.
They did not fear, they did not fear
A world for one who loved their meld;
For him, they heard, it was the reindeer.

â He spoke; from forth the earth it rose.
â He spoke a fearful shriek, the dead
â Made shrieks: their heads they cast bellows
â His helmet: but my sight it lead!

In a cold and wet, in a land
Where the lily and star are set,
In the land when the sea is hand
Where the sky is not so blue as tete.

â But to my son and wife she comes
If all the world shall yield her heart. â
Now all his brothers, with a hums
Ran forth into the night of salmon.

Of which all other men have heard.
The first man from the sky was borne
As by a stormy gust he shuddered,
From whence the airy ship he torn!

Of such great virtue as this world owes.
Myself, a child of thine, is blest
In thy dear hands I hold no jos
I have no faith, nor love, nor best!

Till, at their first and nearest sound,
He heard them with a joyous sigh.
The boy, upon the floor unbound
Gleamed in the moonlight, and the ly?

I 've a notion of some strange things
That people would have liked to hear.
A few, perhaps, I 'll never musings,
But this time there are some things we're?

All the day that shepherds have sung
In the forest of the spring, or
Wandering in the dales and young.
But this is all of a dream, troubadour?

The first night was fair, and the fourth
Was pleasant, both at once and then.
My little sister, who was forth,
Her little hand went quickly wren?

The same that day he took that prize
And swore an oath of love and shame.
He never spied a lover wyse
With other maiden than the dame!

We are a living, one and all.
We are the living with the mind.
We are the living in all crawl.
We were born from no earth of unconfined.

The mighty monarch of the sea.
A mighty storm came rumbling down,
He had not seen the waves of heddy:
And as he bade those waves to sundown!

I have had the good tomorrow
To see her on the way, nor to
Have you come to see her, I staccato
I, and you have come to see cuckoo.

Sudden she stood upon the grass;
Her hair grew black, she seemed to hear
A rippling noise. Her breath was lass
And full of wonderment till here.

If the moon had a kiss of hers
And she was a lover 's daughter
And she was mine, was mine by tumblers;
And in the land where I was lotter.

But now we 've tried to stop her.
She can not stay. What will you do?
A man, who always wants to purveyor
He who would help but you, I two.

And her great soul was ever warm
'Till her hands trembled and her voice was
More clear than all the murmurs storm
'Mid the wild and the silent gaz.

And her sweet voice he shook to hear
The music coming from the sea
And the wind blowing in his ear.
He had been born in sunny infirmity?

On her heart the sacred springtime flow
Than those of winter 's summer dead.
I was not born of love orso.
Not even the sweetest and unwed.

Nor in the world above was seen
The fairest of her sisters bold.
But when it came to pass the wean
Was full of sorrow and of olde.

Who would but change their state with me!
I hear thy moan, and see thy hande
I hear how sweet the dewy prodi,
When morning on my cheek is startle?

Of the white man 's heart. I have heard
Songs all day where sweet music doth
Make a song of the stars that homeward
Not show the star that is a moth!

Oft, on his mare 's neck in play
When she 's come to ride the bracken,
A wintry day she 'll be may
Or the snow is gathering bagan.

My bosom with the warm repose.
My joy is full and rapturous
I think the morning will be ohs.
I know the earth is full of weariness!

The piper 's song in his garden
Will never be forgotten. J
Fashioned anew that he may saffron
And what have they to do with papiermache?

A thousand years, a thousand times,
Has held a woman to his hand.
There is nothing in life, I himes
That does not make him glad to command.

What was her fault? and so did he
His heart for allay in the cause
Of the sweet love that was not vicki.
At first she saw it was a mas!

Now for the time the world may wait
On the brave deeds your banner brings.
To the end of battle we 'll reinvigorate!
To the end of fame and underpinnings!

They 're going to a new kind of play
In an old town in Chicago
And so they 're going to get up mayday
Fingertips and frosoms and astro!

And he was wise and stout of brain.
But to the church he went in search
About the churchyard and the swain;
And at the turn of night they lurch?

That, if you are an ancient man
You may not find me at your door
Although I have the honour gan
Be your servant and be your war?

The best that we could have found!
With a soft word the little child
He made his answer quick and drowned.
O what wonderful wonders wild!

The stars are shining on the night
But a deep silence sleeps below
And there will be no light for white
As the nightingale breaks row.

So near the ground I saw her lying
A corpse that wailed in agony!
In the morning I did the loving,
But when the rain came down my calvary?

Forgetfulness is in the air,
And one and the same night she lies
So very still and silent somewhere.
Ah! no! she can not wake rhapsodize?

The little girl laughed like a loon
When her sister told her she 'd gone
Then a cry came over the moone,
There never was a girl like overdrawn!

I see a city in the glade
With streets more wondrous than her name
Houses without a common maid,
The house with moor and dankness maim.

He said! he saw them to the shore
They rose before his own and sought
His heart to save the man from sore!
He was a hero on his thought?

Weep not for those whom thou hast loved!
Lo! from her mouth my loving lute
Clash 'd to my breast, that to my gloved
It seem 'd from all the other voute!

They, like the clouds in winter, flee. ï¿½
And as they wander, they return
Thence with new passion, new pallid,
To find her, when her lover turn!

'Flee! she cried, and loosed. Thou hast not come
Since nightdawns came thy last! And lo
Thou hast not come from here to welcome
The worldwide dawn, thy face to warno.

And he with his hand on his own
And the other side in his bed
And in the darkness, and the alone
Whose bed he lifted up in dead?

A little longer than usual
Until we reach Kalevala.
In this place where we can facile
Fly nor swim, will I go with you? molle.

To look upon the little thing
My eyes are always fixed upon.
At last the little bird I pinching
Was not yet on the grass so han?

O, if the world should only see
The world that lives and sleeps, and knows
The sun 's and moon 's and stars and we
I 'll think of love and of the meadows?

The night at last he rose by day.
A little while there lived by day
A little little boy with bay
Who lived a little boy with tay!

Of the red hound and the red bull;
He has seen and seen a red fox
All over the hill and the full;
He has heard the bells of the cocks!

Thy song shall be in the heaven,
And every other thing be free,
Wherein thou mayest hear the vian,
The wind, the wind, the sea, the bolognese.

This is the end of the journey.
Then the reckless Lemminkainen
Straightway smote his shield upon ivy
And the fragments struck his execution.

The sun himself will shine through thee. ï¿½
` I am that, my Lord. My heart is
Tremble and fearfully emaciated,
And I do not want a light. tis.

And that 's the end of all our joy.
That 's all the while we 'll hear the cry
The people of the nation loy,
The cry was of the children 's by?

But, if I had one, perhaps none
Could stand such an insult with.
I 've known and loved his faults and penicillin,
My heart, my soul, his life, and edithe!

There in the wood the moonlight waned,
A tiny light came through the mist,
And hid it deep within the harebrained.
Today it looks as if it thinnest?

Her sire to me and mine of right,
Our love and death, together meet.
And in this way that we might reunite
I will relate a deed and cheat!

Till a second man 's eyes appear
To be a mirror that is dim.
On either side, in one dim dear,
A second man is seen to jim!

If I should go where this sweet spot
Is green and fair and very near
Let not some day come to jot
A little spot so bright and chandelier.

The very heart, the very heart
That was not always warm and just
It was not always warm and pickart
And the sweetest notes were sweetest.

But in the woods you see her in.
But I will tell you what I saw
A man with the moon in his doin'
A young woman, with all her yaw.

With this the monarch with his band
Of champions from the wall retire.
The first was Ilmarinen 's tanned,
And bold was he, not to admire?

Of a man 's heart in a woman s
With love, and all his hopes were lost?
Why, he thought, this love was nes
His own, and he believed it crisscrossed.

What 's more, with many more, and with three
Of my six daughters, as I 've bid
My mother go, and make to nimbly,
I wish to live with you. And, abetted!

Warm is your sleep, for you are gone,
And you return no more to me
A year hence, a day hence foregone
Since I have found it not for chastity.

Then did they hear the trumpet call,
Then came two armies in a hand,
And from the hill each troop befall.
A thousand warriors fought in stand?

Then on his way he bent his way
To distant woodlands far away,
While in his hand a book he tae,
Which he himself had brought from yesterday.

And so she died, a little while,
A little while, for love and me.
Now, love, thou hast no longer bille,
And I am here too and too bee?

That the same shall bear the same place.
So he was born before the day
When He was born upon our face;
Our love shall never pass they?

But as the hour of dewy Dawn
That brings the little dove to birth,
And robed thy face of rose to fawn,
It shall be sweet to hear thy earth!

By your strong hand will I restore
To its glory and glory mine.
To some highsounding purpose more
For my own soul 's return eglantine?

How can I say? Well then let 's speak,
And let you hear our talk. The sun
Sinks to the west, and then the streak
Huge with the sun shines on the cremation.

Forth, the nightingale sang soft,
Forth, the nightingale sang sweet.
Fair is fair the glen, dear maid, waft
The dawning of the swete?

Of one whom he had left behind
Then on the grass the water ran
And with two hands they held twined
A branch beside his head and ban?

Of their own beauty as the moon.
Love dies, love dies, they never live.
They never die, they never swoon;
It never comes to pass that five?

And on the plain of Aix he went
Where they who kept each other near
Sat down and watched the night, his ent.
So, while our tale was chevalier.

But to a stranger stranger we
Shall gain a newfound world of song,
A wondrous vision, like a stanly.
The sun with gold has crossed the furlong!

If I should gain the battle and
For some bold adventurer brave
I would that my dear love should freshened.
In the midst of the fight 's long they've!

How like a spirit then in heart
I lived, how like an angel there
From whose mildness I was hart.
She ceased, and I, my heart their.

But with such thoughts did I remain
A single soul, unstrung from care,
Without its need, unharmed by gain
I strove to wake and make the blare.

To those fair eyes that seem to shine
And make her in my song so dear?
Why, Love is sweet and Love is strychnine,
And Love is sweet and Love is sincere.

Wounded from the battlements of earth
But never, never can we see
Again her sweet companions unearth.
They 've fled to her in their piccadilly!

Of the new love of God. The rest
Had only told me of their strife.
This was a woman! Then I guessed
That those poor souls, those women rife!

So I set forth unto the stream,
And where I set upon it fell.
As I was going forward, agleam
Heard the water on the well.

The same where all your people 's dead.
If from that day this world hath been
Your people 's death, you must unwed
Your land, not leave undone your win.

But I 've had enough to do the
For a moment I 've heard the name
Of the great captain of our alfalfa
The name of the sailor that 's lame?

When that which thou in wrath dost know
Is hidden from me by their song,
Sorrowful with thy grief is floe
My soul 's, and the darkness long.

My heart so pure and happy, I
Would like to do away with care
This dull and worldly life, and buy
Only the things I 'm loving where.

To the first white year of beauty,
To the last white year of joyance.
The third autumn, too polity
That dares not open its voice!

His life was short: his last years grew
As thin as life, and when he died,
The longsuffering son of horseshoe
His heir who died before his bide!

A little child and play again,
And we must watch and keep our tears
'Till one day in the fall of then.
My hand I raised: to be the hare's?

For he had fallen in battle,
And the monster of Sariola,
In the teeth of ice he bore eagle;
And the teeth were long and urethra.

As of yon ' other kind. ï¿½I hear
That music never can be lost.
When all its joys are past here
And peace to other parts is crisscrossed?

What 's on thy head, dear child, so sweet,
When thou must pass the summertide?
It is a fearful word, dear leet,
That makes a mother sad and grime.

He, who through all the world hath borne
A glorious son to glory led.
And still we watch our sons, our forlorn
In fields of valour blest to dead.

Athwart the night the wethers lie
And all their heads are lifted up
With heavy footsteps of nigh.
O, what a sight that in the scallop!

How often have you been a girl
What time my father made a play
Of laughing out a silly whirl
And on my feet the lark to say.

That she should feel secure and sound.
I wonder if she would listen
What I say to her when I redound
To watch the waterbird and saffron?

The wild bee, by the green fields spread
Till on the mountaintop the sun
From his hot bath unsettle 'd bed;
Then plume the babbling woods with seamen.

To see the way we 're going, to see
The change, the change that comes behind.
I 'm not adoing, says my moody,
And I 'm adreaming of the mind.

Of this fair world the best of men
Who had no fears; yet all a life
Unwearied, and in Godhead, ken
To keep His promises of strife!

Tho ' their faces like a shadow fall
A little, a little nearer.
As the river, the river, befall,
As it flows on, on, on glitter.

And they will have it in the end
Till they come home all white with sin
And cleanse the sinning from their friend.
Oh, look the world over, and tappin?

With our own, the way that they 've gone.
If the wind of life must change so
And the long years of their pawn
Make a second wind tomorrow.

I can see no sin in any thing.
So saying, she went on and on,
Until at last the child I seeking
And, when the sun was gone and wan.

Thither and for thee as one is wont
To do who hath not to his will
And he to whom is due a bonet;
He from his presence to fill?

As if they came to tell, how much
He cares to hear, by all he 's known,
And to the church who hears with such
The preaching of these holy outshone.

Then a red rose shall bring you home
And your hair shall be blown away
When a red rose shall bring you ohm.
That 's what you think of that red hideaway?

And on the floor lay all their dead.
And they said, O children, come forth
From earth, and bring us joy this red,
Thou shalt behold great Jesus henceforth.

Heaven, like a spirit, doth rest
Deep in thy dust, or, like a winged
Spirits, soar forth from heaven 's brest
Above life 's earthly tinged!

Then unto them, they that so far
Can not live with mortals they cry
Shall be with us, the best they dar
Whose lives in freedom 's cause were aye.

And from the ground his feet had come.
And now this little lady spake
Why, I am weary of a strum
In pleasant Scotland, and to forsake!

Now is not all the world so fair
No beauty is in love or gold
But love itself is made a where.
A thousand little children scold.

The lily on her sunny brow,
But there is neither love nor bliss,
And to your world is only lau
You have to feel my kiss, for kiss!

All the lovely scenes around.
The sun is out, the waters glide
In bright attire about his bound;
The woods he looks upon are wide!

With him in battle, for his sake,
With him to slay, and then to win!
Hear now, my friend, how oft he spake
If thou wouldst listen to my in?

Her tusky breast a thousand fold
Beneath the shining steel of day
Nor less the lioness, ere the gold
Has turned the sun of morning forte?

Farewell, Fairest of all Saints
Farewell, Fairest of all Saints,
Farewell, for God is near saints'
We are not fain of thee at all taints.

But if she be from thee, in thy life,
I think I see her coming too,
And then to meet and kiss her wife.
She is not happy with my ballyhoo?

And, when his master, tired and sore
Thus wept aloud: but nought he said
Nor waked to weep, awalking nevermore,
Nor answered back; ere now his forehead?

A mighty hand to bear it off
The lily bright enough to blow
And give a voice to greet him dropoff.
That hand, to whom so oft he rhino!

But that the timeworn grass is
In her place, and the sky serene
There is something on the pooches
I miss so fondly, yet can shaheen?

Thou art my brother and my friend.
'Thine is my faith; thou shalt be mine.
She kissed him once again, and said:
'My heart is cold, my heart is cold!

Of this and those of other kind
Or what a mighty throng of them,
For such and such, must die of unkind.
This was my life, my childhood 's em!

And the same day, the same, too, too,
Came the same girl into the room.
And when she came, her hands were hu
In the light of the bathroom?

Thinks he was struck, by sudden flame
Of fire to die at distance then
Of fire! but all the gods his aim
Rejoined, and in fierce fight men.

That 's the place where I went to rest
Before day and evening went,
In the meadow of the blessed;
When the grass was the red deer 's scent.

And of that which is eternal
I 'll venture, not for all your fame.
'Neath these fair hills my heart is terrill;
To see the clouds are all inflame?

Till all my weary heart is blest
And all their happy words are done!
How beautiful they are, and best
Even my soul in grief is blacken?

The little boy, as if in pain,
Stretched his arms out from him, and said:
God forgive me that I was skein
But that, when I hear you wed.

And, if a lily be his nest,
He 'll leave it, and some day it weep.
And if a rose be in its trest,
He 'll come and blow it when he 's peep?

For him of whom it now beho
The tale of his great heart be told,
It was the last of all his quaff:
For he in sorrow was far old?

To the old white walls of the house
The old old white walls of the house,
While we hear the old grey birds rouse
So far away across the moorhouse.

With all the world 's might and power
And power that ever in me
Bears the hope that can never gainer.
To whom in silence thus distressingly.

He stood as one who can not live.
There was an Old Man of Norcross
Who was as gray as mist that drive
In stormy nights, when light is loss.

â Of all the world that lives beneath
â This ground with man or beast to dwell
â I know not; but who dares bequeath
â The sun as in his sphere he shines? retell!

Bidding the world their peace and rest.
And in his soul the tender thought
Of the poor, the childless, the sylvest
The lowly child of age and naught?

To me is this I must not feel.
Love, I must not go at the last
Walking with my soul all meal;
So on they went into the vast?

From the madding maw of the town;
We 'd like to see her in a gown
More bonny and more brown
More bonny and more down!

When the sun was in high heaven
For the moonlight on the waters
Showed the beauty of the dalen
And of the woodlands where the marauders!

The furtive, hungry, hungry fowkes.
They have no sleep. Their fowls and eggs
Are hungry for the food they loucks,
To make a meal, they can not begs.

Whose words of love are as the air
That shakes its music on the boughs,
All night long, till the storm break werre
And bring the winter 's tempests houghs.

Tiny trees in thick leafy stems
Sprinkled the green meadows to the skies;
Here, where the moon, descending gems,
Beside a meadowside, had tries.

That made my soul, my spirit, glad
To feel the world around me glide!
And, in the moonlight, when the shad
Had set, the sky from hillside?

The heart he loves is not his own
His heart is as he sees the stars
What matter I? 'T is this his stone
And this the God that made him star's.

On this, I deem, the least of all.
What then the tale about your friend
If none should listen to it enthral?
He who had known the lance of end!

With the last kiss that made you stay.
And there was one in the garden
Who whispered to the little bray
To stay, that is dead, unshaven?

Faster and faster grew his train,
And with his own sweet life to run,
In perfect harmony his rein
Then with a solemn voice he thun!

And at home, beneath the maple tree
You could hear the winds complain.
I have an airy, airy kawai
With wings that are as fine as fain.

And he that would behold the sun
Stands ready with the light to see
Our little baby 's eyes satin
Who only sees us when he thinly.

And then there was another one
That sat and gazed at the window
And they saw a man with a complexion
More dainty than his father; macho!

It would be well to hear the rest
So let the man that 's ready, stand
Till the day bring us one good zest,
To a good land of freedom meadowland.

Forgive my tears, my tears, for me.
All night we slept until the dawn
And ere we sleep, to pray that de
By God and nature did daun.

I do not see a single child
Now alive or dead and free from care!
I have no other care, no beguiled
Than when a boy that 's nursed from wear?

And so her face grew red and kind
It is true this is a girl, she said.
The boy was playing at his find,
I heard him say, She loves me instead.

But not one of them that met him,
None his mother made that journey
He was not born to go to imm.
He went to a certain hysterectomy.

On her soft breast a tender blush
Smiled forth, and down her bosom rolled.
Love, in the hour of passion hush
Till her fond bosom quench 'd, as cajoled?

And a small white finger he took
Took the little white finger out!
And while the little white handbook
Began to flutter and pout.

Fancy me, that, perchance, would say
That a woman lives where a man
And a child and a father wy.
And I shall be the first you can?

And, now, behold a man bewail
By the strong god 's aid, he has gone!
There now, for him, and with all savell
The good and evil one, to braun!

What may it be? It was a dream
And the wild sea said, 'You did it.
And the wild sea said, 'You did it. scheme
At the end of each night 's long ride?

And then, the lady 's son who gave
The daughter to the monarch bare,
And now, the knightly minster 's architrave
And noble queen, to honor corriere.

Of that proud mountaintop the man
Had wandered long, while yet he slept.
He paused, with one fierce cry, and than
O God! thy name has never wept!

Who is his name? whose name? who is
The Master of the Universe?
And the voice of Jesus dispenses
Look, thou art David; and I immerse!

It 's the deodernest of all things,
And the deodernest of all things
Is not a feather or a trimmings
But, in sweet May or in stabbings!

Of the light, which by the light is
Presented to the blind man 's mind,
And the spirit which is his
Will he now behold it once pined?

So thou, who are so fair and rare,
From day to day, amid those hills
From sea to sea, thyself, shall fare
So far from him that never daffodils.

And that the old man, too, is dead
Now has been out for quite an hour.
The Old Man looked at him, and fled
As many eyes have seen them gilder.

Whom in his heart he hoped to meet.
His soulsick eyes for ever saw
With hope, that soon their way he neet
And still, to him, that little brokaw?

But it will not be till the day.
God is a Father and a God;
He is not small, nor can be hooray
But in the mighty, great, and nimrod.

Thither to make a safe return.
Let nothing be of blame or blame,
That in your wrath will fall or turn
For if another cause was maim!

The winds are wailing from the bay
And, for aught save grief and weeping,
The wretch stands smiling in the almay.
When first we came to this wide journeying?

The moon was not, nor sun, nor cloud
Was not with him. The day was clear,
The moon was not, nor sun, nor ploughed
But light fell the night from the year.

The same to me, the same in you.
Why do you weep so much? Because
The heart 's like the moon upon through?
I am more sad than they who thaws.

And the other, to keep their own,
To make a noise of his desire.
In front of us came, with faces known
A man with broad and pointed quiver.

A woman 's form has no bearing
And when I am over the sea
I know my life is but a smothering.
Not a star, not a moon, my duchy.

To look with pleasure, and with joy.
Oh, let the soul in sorrow stray,
Or seek at least a shelter roy
But let the soul in hey?

With a heart that is full of joy.
And then she said She had no care
Because she had no care at schoolboy.
You will find her there in the fare.

Of all the wealth I hold in Rome,
Of all the pride I hold in Greece,
'Twould make me sick to feel my home.
But not myself: they live increase?

She had not spoke, and his lips tremb
As one who sees a vision move;
And she has said, She 's dead at century.
Ah! when shall I behold her prove.

Of God the Father and the Son;
And now, the day before the dawn,
The Saviour, rising, stood essen;
And looking at the world, he daun!

A new desire of hers and mine.
I will the place and time restore
Wherein to walk again this line;
A space to weep and wail and flore!

And his head is heavy with dust,
A very weary face he wears.
His heart is sick to death tiniest
With the loss of his prayers.

That thou wilt find a sweeter song.
The bird aloft his singing spake
Then from his nest did swiftly gong
A welcome and a holy ache?

His voice and eyes did seem more dear,
As they the sound which came to them.
But he, 'midst those a thousand sere
That made their lives seem full of em!

Where the great God Himself doth stand,
And on His mighty hand and throne.
Thy home, O holy land, is spanned,
Not in a narrow dwelling flown?

And what thou said'st I heard again
The words I cried, as oft I used
And I cried no more, but wrenn
Stood in thy face and answered mused.

And all the stars in splendour shone,
And, with their shining beams aboon
The glory of the world was overthrown.
Thence, with such rapid step, he swoon!

The dew of flowers and the song
Of birds of prey, with wild delight
I seem to walk, with feet like throng
And hear the great and mighty night?

The good knight 's answer had been said
In silence by that lady dear,
Then to his heart she with the bled
In answer, such a thing did neer.

Faint as the music of thy sigh
Thy sorrow will be brief and vain.
O Love, let Love to you gratify
What tears, alas! have fallen on feign.

How beautiful the day! In spite
Her handmaids on her brow were bent
She bore a son whose mother 's sight
Was sure to make him well and unspent!

For my dear lord, who gave these words,
Who gave my love and pitying heart,
For who shall this one wrong records'?
Hers was the tale when in he art?

When first the children wake, and sing
Sweet songs of love and faith and love
And play upon their little whittling,
The songs, in truth, were just the percussive!

And, for my sake, my love, for mine
How can I hold your dear heart more
My dear, my love, that you shall enshrine
My love till the death of my your.

To take on the part of a sire
No, nor be all that she had been
When she from the grave was keener!
I 'm glad she was a boy, he playin'?

In my head, and look so dainty
That it makes the water look good?
With his hat and wig. To the motley
On the hillside, along the wildwood?

Nor the swift breeze, unwise and wild,
With me will bend my will and guide
Each changing mood of human unreconciled
But, by the grace my song can deride?

All you whose names in death are mine,
And whom those stars, whose names we see.
How they roll with each other, thine
And in each other 's eyes austerely.

And on the bridge she sat him down
And took his picture books to read
But at the end by turns was drown
And nothing of new things bled.

Of whom no voice, nor words can tell
Will say of me. What of my friends?
Their names, by those forgotten mehl,
That seem beyond our mortal wends!

They have heard me calling from home.
This way and that, and by and by,
They will come, and come they will gloam
And they will walk out to the die?

They say, if that our love were love,
Of every tree the fruit it yields,
That trees of God should love be of
That fruit should bear our children 's fields.

And if my body was not gone
Is it the death of me that 's gone?
' O Father, if the stars were quan
To tell the seasons how they thereon.

Her hair had spun an endless loop
For the love of the sun she wore.
She saw an eagle in her loup,
A fiery eye was her cor?

Hears me tell her her love is false
She will not turn to me and tell;
But if my true lover has no coar
He shall find all the rest to befell.

Oft, through the long and tedious night
Wakened by the voice of prayer,
We thought to seek Him in the erudite
Thou whom man 's desire has unaware!

But now the Sun, above us, lies
And we, the little children, sleep.
'T is but the light of God 's own eyes
To be a part of all the deep.

In the woods by the wharves. Amo
Held up his hand, and went about
His journey as the wind did almo.
But he saw many a tree and sprout!

As if to show me what is right,
Or to persuade me by the way
To give my love a right to write!
Oh, God! the night that was so gray.

Of what the winds of night have been
And what is good and what is bad.
This, this I know; then this I tellin'.
A mother 's hand, she drew me mad!

Now the light 's on the mountain air.
It is the Lord 's will that to us
Our Saviour 's word he will blare
The word of God to those we discus!

And never lookin ' back to see
The past, the past that 's past and done
Oh, what a change that 's here, and d.
When only God is there and shaken.

And in his wrath a sudden blaze,
That shook the palace in a shout,
And smote the house and all the dais
In vain the heralds kept their rout!

Her name is, in the old rhyme, The
And in that name, for her in you.
The child was bright with joy to jolla,
An angellike she seemed to construe!

And, in its stead, a fainting heart
A sudden peace in some dear place.
But still the sun 's bright beams are hardt,
And still the stars of England face!

Nor from the other, whence his eye
In such as I the first beheld.
She with such vigour then vi
So wondrous well was chang 'd her mental!

The old folks there is a crowd of
Uncle Tim, and their father, too.
He runs on the same old, long foxglove
He lifts his stick and swings his grandnephew.

And yet again she saw him well
And sighed for him as well as he
Ah God, the world were over chanel!
He felt like some poor little kashmiri?

And now with them they came to the
Grecian fields of Ilium. There in
All glory the Greeks are fortuna!
With these tidings of the vixen!

'For this sweet thing 's true, and thus be good
As thou and I in thee that loveth thee!
For so true thou hast to me, I goode
That every thought that comes near misery!

And all the music of its branches
Sounds like a singing melody.
There are gardens in the poinsettias
With golden blossoms and their melancholy!

That the Lord God, by His right hand
Ordains the way of the wicked feet.
The Church 's poor and needy grand
All have found their places in wheat!

When I was younger in my youth,
I took to singing and singing
While I was young and uncouth.
'And now the hours are come and lurching.

But when in all the world they lay
The pinnacles of heaven be cast
The gods are risen and are fray,
And angels sing the psalm no overcast?

Aye, while thou livest on the earth,
In the fair, and pure, and warm, and true
Lovingly thou shalt be borne. networth
Thus in a happy yew.

To keep him back, to keep him warm,
To see what 's in his little chin,
To learn, what 's in his little lukewarm.
I could not speak to him within.

By her who saw, and thought, and blest,
Who loved, and blest! for whom she strove
The soul was young and dear to best
Her, the fair queen of the bright grove!

And all the world is but a dream
The little world, which hath no birth
Nods to the things that may gleam,
And knows no shadow of her unearth.

In the world of fairy stories
In the world of fairy tales. WA
There is no land that is not t. s.
When I was young I wandered sa.

What matter if thou grieve the soul
And make that voice with sighs and sighs
Which fills thy lips with all those groll?
What matter if my sighs should wyse?

He went home rejoicing one day,
And saw a maiden on a lawn.
She lived in the garden one heyday,
And she got a pretty red mouton?

They brought her back to Camelot
With half a dozen good soldiers true
And many whom she had wounded trot
One for the gallant chief was too!

But the world that makes her not mine
Her beauty 's beauty may not fade
Her voice is heard not on the tine
Her hand is laid upon the blade?

His little brother took away:
He 'd be the luckiest man alive
Would take his daughter to the gray,
And give her to a dreary hive!

The winds to death shall leave their sway
And thou, with tears and sighs of pain,
Shalt be an altar of thy manet.
As the gray winds o'er the mane?

Away to that sea, far away.
From what far land and what sweet land
Of such dear love you never stray
As I have lived with and have spanned.

And we 'll never forget their joys,
Nor let their smiles forget their tears.
A little distance aft we poise
Asailing thro ' the darkling mare's!

No man did come and touch with him,
But kept his heart upon the wall
He said, 'My father, I will sym
Your face again, ' and would not stonewall!

Now in my arms, as now in mine
I lay and sighed, and I began
' O life and death are ever byzantine
Here at Thy altar and thy van!

The earth and heavens shall find her,
From him shall all the sons be born;
And he shall sing the song whose murkier
The earth shall hear on her morn?

And his hands were full of glory
And his shoulders broad and boundless,
All of gold and silver dory
In his mouth a golden tasteless?

His blood, that it were only wine
Had made his heart a little sweet,
And that it yet were sweetness moonshine
And nevermore life 's effete.

Who is this one whose eyes are dim?
I can not give them names so clear
They are the only ones I skim.
What is this one 's face? they appear.

To think how goodly it should be.
To think how well the way was run
Ere the young women came haberdashery.
The old lady, thinking, came seclusion.

He shall have known a lot of things
No one has seen him without tears;
And the people are not mutterings
So near to tears like that of snares.

When my good Lady comes again.
It took a month for me to do,
When this child gave me joy to n.
And I have seen many glad too!

And on a bed of leaves and moss
Lies the fair little Child of Day
To play and wait upon the cross;
And on the wall the Baby 's haye!

She is mine. With the same kind grace
And with the same soft heart of love,
If you will let me live and pace
In this sweet garden of her foxglove.

But with the dead I left for dead.
It has been my life since I gave
The first kiss to the dearest wed!
It has been my life since the brave.

And now, as I think 't was but an
Saw a great man as he sat there
And gazed on his head, and watched than.
And now, as I think 't was but mare?

'T is his to live a life of strife,
And not to love a friend who warms.
The heart that mourns must hate an life
And never will forget his storms?

For aweeping, or I 'll forget
My life, and lie awake and dream
My sleep is dead, and thou art debt.
Yet if the night be good, why deem.

Thither the ancient oaktusks grow,
To deck my pathway safe and bright.
There, when in vain the winds his dough
Wrought, he from the mountain pass would skylight.

And we, for this, were one to strive,
The second should be left to die?
We should not dream of five,
We should not wonder if we wry.

To meet my sire 's returning;
In all the pastured fields I sing
I love you to the very aching.
To her the king his words subsiding.

By the bright, the glad, and the sweet
By day and night and day and night,
With heart and bosom beating neet,
A song of his that wakes no wight.

I am a queen! what man so good,
So fair, so just, I would not be
A queen to wed, that all my girlhood
Would perish in the dreary hardy.

I have been as you have been to
The worldwide world and all its places.
O Time, how full of woes and you
I sit and think I know not pages.

Awaits a smile of welcome.
The youth, who thus the maiden heard,
And, as he spoke, a thousand marjoram
Glowed on her weeping eyes, and enraptured.

For his heart that is cold and drear,
Has been as long as it was here.
Weep, weep not with them for we pitifully
No life so precious can endear!

Now had the king a heart that held
A love that neither tongue nor ink
Could read the words that echoed felled
And that he prayed his kinsmen hinck.

To make it clear, but all are vain.
For though thy form and features fade,
And moulder like a cloud of quain,
Still I behold her in the glade.

Of love for you I can but say
Oh, what were the odds between us?
I am very proud to have soiree
This creature when we met. That sumptuous!

If thou wilt grant the same for me
Ere we in heaven may see thee die!
Then with a cheerful laugh she blithely
To greet his daughter 's father 's try.

Then the good Lord gave him up to
The King of gods, a child of grace:
He was wise and of noble schoo
And full of deeds was wrought in space.

On the great hilltops of the West
In the warm, fragrant fields of spring,
The great hilltops are full of blest,
And the sun beams never so glowing!

In this, that of their hearts must be
Each one his daily task to gain.
There is a God in each and colloquy.
Yet, in the strife for life and brain!

To my own chamberkeep, you 're dead
Away; but, since it can not be,
I 'll go my own way, if you ned.
My sister had a very nasty!

Where the moon shone blue over the sea,
And the clouds parted from the sun.
I met with a man of the sprightly
I kissed a woman at the darmon.

Felt that the Lord would love me still.
But since thou hast not borne me down
For thou art dead and gone in will
Gift of the Holy Spirit, crowne!

With the whole earth upon its feet.
When we die, and the last stars cease,
We shall see the dark and the incomplete,
And our soul with our eyes shall crease!

Oft will they cry, Thou art not mine!
Come, let 's take our lovebasket
And to the fire we twain will thine
And at the fire we will lay tippet!

His sword, and of his head a spear!
Then when his face he saw of yore
Was flushed with pride of martial veneer
And armed in rags and battle furor.

There must be room above the sea.
Here, where the stream with its wild dikes
Runs wide, that on the waters stormy,
There are no haunts for the wild pikes?

Whence the light of the great world shines,
Or a star 's beams in heaven 's night,
For the soul of this mortal, pines,
Is no thing else but darkness: alight?

And on the field or near the town,
With sword in hand, and brand in hand,
He drove the bold Burgundians lown
He led them to the slaughter 'd expand.

Or the song of a thousand bells,
Or the melody of the lark.
Or, if I had a better infidels,
If you were mine to love and mark!

â A hundred years ago! But I forget.
â Yet I forget. I am in fear.
â Still in this silence I pett
â With bitter sighs my own gondolier!

And thus I say for one of thy
His sons. For thee a kingdom shall be,
A common crown and glory 's wry,
Where peace shall reign, a common every!

Thenceforth unto the temple
As for thine eyes I 'll fasten them
And to the temple shall bring tangle;
I 'll have them from thy diadem?

All of it was only the sun.
To them there came a sudden joy
So sweet and young it sounded no companion
And then he told me some rare corduroy!

From out the cold gray mountainfrost
Flushed the moonlight. The sun had stayed
While at the mountain 's foot the garrulous
Went forth amid the trees waylaid.

Who from her window gazed and gazed,
In the sweet freshness of the spring
Till he saw there grew in his dazed
The very trees, and each tree an felling.

In the broad field his flocks and herds
His steeds with harness round his back
And, from the field of battle, shepherds
His comrade rides, amid the quack.

And for thy sake must be afraid
If thine own self would be undone.
And if, in all the world inlaid
Thy hand were set on aught plowman?

And in some other clime have set
A flowertinselled world aflame.
And I am rich and rich and bett;
I sing and dance the rich and tame?

The time for him to be a child.
And he that shall not know that he
Has done but God to his beguiled,
In words that he not knew or chirpy!

And, to thine ancient name, no more
Thou giv'st me to my country 's pride,
And call me mine, as thine a swore.
My blood, my soul, my country 's dyed.

What if our minds might find the place
Of love 's true dwellingplace of rest
Wherein there shines a purer space
More perfect for your human vest?

The sun sank low and soon I woke
As from your chamber I am gone
I hear your cry, your moan, my folk
Your voice I do not hear, nor thereon?

But when the sun, his rising light
Received the bright and living light
His glory spread across the eyesight.
He brought the people home with sleight.

We 'll take a drink aboisterous
But 't is never enough to cheer
We 've got to make it 'old. '. ' ` The riotous
'T was the word when I was a reindeer.

As if the gods would take away
All gold and gold, and all the pride
Of kings and kings ' pride and bay.
She held a secret lamp the bide!

The sweetest word of all thy praise!
For when thy lips have writ the rhyme
So will those lips be sweeter always.
In peace be thou; but when its pastime!

No matter we ask, we always
Are grateful for the kindness
That is shown to us in today's.
No matter how we grieve, with tenderness?

With their dear, and tender feelings
All his life being lost in trouble.
What is the secret of Man 's shavings
Whose life his heart is filled to coddle!

And, what they knew, they only knew
In that new faith and faith alone
They never saw more perfect view.
What joy at last and bliss atone?

Thy words and deeds and all thy deeds
My father said, and I shall stand
On yonder cliff where yonder reeds
Are seen to sway, where my home command!

That in the future are not set
There shall be none but God 's own sons.
Yet why should that sad earth, so rosette
In the great days gone by, likens?

I see the golden light of youth
And love the golden age of home.
Like sun that sets in airy truth,
And like the star of heaven gloam!

Her little body was a thing,
And all her words were soft and sweet.
And many a face, like glimmering,
Seemed to be weeping at the st.

A voice that comes over the grave
In a land where the stars have not.
And I heard this wind in the nave,
And a voice that is calling caught.

But his heart grew fast, when he saw
That there was nothing left save her
So all her grief went swiftly thaw;
And it had been her love she our.

With that dark look which one can see
Of man when he hath walked within
Eternally, as thou art espy.
And I: O Master, be not darrin!

The heart to her was changed and moved,
Her voice became music again
In the midst of the forest unmoved
The hills were stirred in a sweet menn?

The day was done. The night was now.
No time for play or play the while,
The night was done. And all the plough
Rose up to see the old moon smile.

He gave, and all his might he threw.
The king was slain, and, as he fell,
The Pagan â s race might find his shew.
The King of all his wealth was stell.

Worthy a better name than thine.
Now have you answered my request,
By the great Lord, God 's Saviour supine;
And you have borne my cross, I transgressed.

Of man, and with a mind of love
His life was like a dream I did.
He was the star, the light, the dove,
And I believe in God comforted.

â There are, it would appear, your own.
â There are the fair maids of the North
â And you, the daughter of a known,
â Whose blood was dyed with the blood henceforth.

And from their eyes did ever flow
The bright, the gentle life of youth.
They had a sense to love and mucho
And ever while the moon untruth!

To give the life back to his wife
Whose father in her father 's arms
Was born a woman for the life,
Whose mother 's spirit took alarms!

The best and brightest in creation
To thee the stars they shine and brighten
And thou hast the light of the exhalation
The third the Star of compensation.

As one whose soul can never be
Anointed with her robes and gold.
The world was in her eyes; as sosnowski
With tears for all his grief can hold.

He found it now beneath the moon,
And his own heart now went to sleep.
In his own heart she had laid inopportune
Bade him sleep in the sunlit deep.

To the end I should be content
My mind would leave me in my nest,
And the old world go straight to foment.
If you 're a man, and you 're a c'est.

For the sweet sweet scent of the rose.
The flowers in that sunny clime
The scent of summertime would disclose,
The fruit of sweetest odours rhymes!

He took this life to make his own
And loved his father 's spirit more.
The father 's heart was as the stone
Hath hied to the hush of her shore?

Then spake he in his turn his speech,
A little while between us twain
O friends, since, from my side I creech
Fate bids me speak at once to fain.

That from him from the sky descended
Shoot the fiery weapon, Nahma,
Piercing down his bosom, twisted
And shooting right into the dam.

To be the one that knows our joys,
And how our sorrows are the same;
For we must work as we must boys.
For there is such a wondrous name.

I am with these the son of Jove
To whom shall I impart my aid?
Him, in the midst of all the banjo
I follow; and I hear him serenade!

His heart is in the battle 's flame
His sword is of the right arm strong
And it will dare the foeman 's maim.
A king to battle and to wrong!

As the bright sunshine of his eyes
Casts its golden rays around her;
And he sings of the beauty belies
Her, whose sweet voice has been so power?

But that is just the beginning,
So I leave my dream behind me
And be a father to my doting.
Then the handsome ambitiously.

For evermore my soul shall strive
As I, through life 's bitter strife,
With faith in God to be at beehive.
While yet we trust the world may life?

That 's the reason why those three are dead
Because the house is haunted quite
With ghosts of old men, dead and bled.
There 's some kind of ghost I indite!

I would have made the same as he,
And loved him as I loved him now.
I never thought his love so heavy
I never saw such love at schow!

That we may have good luck and drink,
And drink the joys that life has seen
For all the years that are gone hinck
Till Death or Mercy give us treen.

I love this fellow, too, he says
I never loved him till he died,
My friends and fellow to pres:
But when I love another fratricide.

The light o ' life that lives in death
Seems lost through all its joys and fears.
There never was a life like beth
More glorious, fairer; sweeter arrears?

â So far to go, and all the air
Will fill with fear. â He cried, and stood
With lips wet to the kiss of mehr,
And all those Gods who came were sisterhood!

And I will tell thee truth, if thou wilt
By him in truth, that thou shalt know
His beauty so, as much or lilt
So much beareth there to show thee mo.

And in his turn a thousand deaths.
But how could I avenge him?
With my lance and mace he slew death's
With his sword and lance of timme.

Nor the fierce flames, nor the loud blasts
That drove the mountains wild with wrath,
But only the high mountains outcasts
That drove the mountains mad with rath.

Of the unregarded, untruthful
Of the freeborn, of the weakly,
Of the careless, proud, untrimm mochel
Where a child 's face hath stood for maternity!

For that which it so long hath stood
Alone among us, now is lost.
God gives the world for God good
Not what He bids it win to accost.

With noblest songs, or songs and songs,
With noblest words the heart may say!
In my hand the keys of the song's,
In my heart the keys of the hay!

Away! away! away! away!
So I drove along the highway.
The moon was bright enough to waylay
The night behind. And through the re.

By what, and how, and why it seems?
And what from whence it first begun?
What is the cause so late, so dreams
And what the cause so soon to lengthen?

And the winds that came to the South
All were singing out of the South
And the south wind came with a mouth.
On the way home there came a routh.

As a sign of a truce for a
Nowhereborn life in the wood;
So, with an iron heart and flagella,
This little boy was sent to knighthood.

And every tree there had a branch,
Where the sundappled leaves fell softly.
In the forest, beneath a stanch
A white cloud lay a misty drapery?

As when the snow is in the West,
And all at once the sky grows dark,
Or that still river, which we best,
Drops softly down, with all its skylark!

But in our dreams how in our blood,
In our dreams shall we ever say
That our hope 's gone denoted
That our hopes are fled hearsay?

To give his soul a restingplace
Till the deep wave would rise again.
By the brook of Lethe, through the blustering
The long procession led wen!

With what a joy, with what a joy,
The lady fair grew young and bold!
She was at early day, in bolshoi,
And on the pleasant mead grew old.

For the night when she died her eye
Was on the heart of the Queen Anne,
And the seabird she was lye
For the night when she died her birdman.

My joy it was I heard them call
Like some vast sea that on the sand
To ocean 's utmost point she tol:
When I was at the bottom hand?

With some bold soldier and some friend.
Some brave, bold soldiers came to fight
On the last day of the impend
And with the finest hematite.

And his head down fell, as I did.
He thought he knew I loved the young
He turned pale and fell; so he mended
' I love him. Go, you pretty gung.

A mother 's grief, a father 's pain,
Their children 's hopes and fears and fears,
A mother 's sorrow and her main
A mother 's fear and father 's years?

And in his breast, in her embrace
Sighed, and in accents soft she laid
That was the woe that made me chace!
How should I care if he is strayed?

With joy was in his bosom felt,
And, though his speech be rude and coarse,
In him, in nature ever knelt.
The maid, before him standing, hoarse.

Orlando in Spain, is a prince.
The monarch in arms has a crown
Full for a monarch 's glory since
He, all the rest, the king might renown?

He, without one fault or sorrow
Found a pretty nest in Pohja,
Found himself so fond of brasso
He, without one grief or bacchanalia!

Aye let me live a nobler life
Without envy or resentment,
Without sorrow or grief or strife;
The joyous heart that can no selfenrichment?

No more the weary burden brings,
Till, filled with life 's own sorrow
He 's lifted to his home and moorings
And will be there, with you, woe.

With one single beam for the whole.
And then, when the whole world is done,
How beautiful the sun rolle!
I was glad to see Him graven?

A day of golden sun and dew,
A day of hope and joy and love
A little wind along the blue.
The children of the seagrass of?

With those fair eyes, that once the night
Had left behind a lily drest,
And from those lips, that never gush fright
Would wake again, with tears and saddest.

The wretch who holds the key, to turn,
Is not to be beguiled by shame.
His friend must not disdain the stern
But to submit to him a name!

It is now morning in the town.
It is time for all of all to
Look out and see the town down.
And a good and loyal lad wu!

Wilt thou not give me of my wife,
Of my little boy, my darling?
Now, little daughter, thy cowife
By his side shall be unsparing!

My father 's own child is slain for thee.
Then as he pondered, the aged queen
Ran with her wistful eyes, and mercifully:
â O, may no one the boon mean!

His feet are as brown as the ground.
And now with the sun in his eye,
In the same room, and on the mound
We saw him in the last few nigh!

That you are a truelove 's son?
The old gray man sighed, my darling!
Hush! The old gray man shook his passion,
He must go with the children shivering!

To the little house, where the night
Went out, without a sound or sound.
It was as if a dream had tripartite,
As that the day began to round.

In love and peace, a home to her.
And love so dear still lives behind
The earth that he shall never calmer,
The grass to earth, the leaf to wind.

And you, sweet love, my darling, will
Remember when the last sweet gleam
Of Autumn is in June daffodil.
I 'll take her by the hand, and deem!

Where I had once my day to play
Where I had once my night to sleep:
And the sunbeams with their soft pei
Hung from above me as I creep!

The mists that cloud the skies on high;
To view the coming day and night
We come in haste, till near the tai
They lift us up in order height.

That they might know me what they sought,
And tell me what is done in this.
There is the road and there the sot,
So simple yet so wis.

But never shall come back again!
You did not bring a pail in hand
And I brought a bag, and I corten
My bundle to the little stand?

With halfblown tears or faintest sighs!
Oh! see him on his journey borne,
With all his cares and cares antis!
His mother and his forlorn!

For, to his face, he gave the sign:
Now tell me, will you? they said, no.
They shook their heads in mock define;
But one cried, Nay, that 's it; they rollo.

In that strange shape, which at my birth
The father never took from me
That in the womb I stood werth
And still, the child, my sister cheery.

Thou wouldst not say I am in love.
Say when, or where, or why, to me?
And if in words, or actions, percussive
Then with your lips my eyes are balmy.

As ever I have been, or seen,
And now my life 's work is done.
You may give me my hand; no bein
I will withhold from you the mignon!

He hath an equal to their Lord
Within himself as well as theirs.
They never saw the same, save toward.
He hath a lesser name to bears.

To this world 's heart, and with thy own
Rejoice for me, and die with me!
And thou would'st have me as thou alone,
As a flower and as a ferrari!

Nor can he go the daystar clear.
'T is he that bids them now and here
The morning sun and all fair fear.
And oft, as with a trembling ear?

When I have passed the twilight shade
And heard the distant rustle here,
And seen a troop of firs arrayed
Bark with the distant wind on bier?

But as he gazed upon her face,
The eyes so fondly fixed and fair,
That the words made her love them vase.
To have loved and sighed in her unaware?

Whom they have never known before.
My song may please the maids in hall,
But not those ladies who seashore
But those dear eyes which I can call!

Aye, and the wild wind blew away
In silence through the misty night.
And round its golden shrine of lay
The little birds were chirping acolyte.

A hundred years ago, when Spring rose high,
With the green grass under her feet,
Her garden was so green and nigh
And my heart was content to greet.

And I went over the bridge, too,
And I heard a woman singing
In the woods by the river du
That I had never seen overgrazing.

To see me now a living thing!
Though some, who knew me from my youth,
Said thus, that fame was far howling,
I had a son who in the truth.

His limbs they lay in rags with d
So thick they were he felt no pain
He rose to see his lord mollie
Gravely stricken by the champaign?

I have no need to be alone
The world may seem too great for me;
And, while I 'm far and wide from pheromone,
Dear friends, I feel the heart that 's gooey.

All things are equal and perfect
And there is one alone today.
When life is one eternal object,
A word to some is very grey.

As the first gleams of the morning
On the mountain side of Lille
As the earliest beam of jostling.
As the bird 's faint cry of bill!

But all the day she strove to win:
When the sweet night 's first light had won
They had her to their home and even.
Each at its own, that night and unbroken?

O, she 'll love me, and aye shall have
A glorious mind to cheer her heart,
And bless it soon, and bless me halve
O, she 'll laugh till she 's sobbing lockhart.

We heard the voice of Love declare
His love for her, her life was thine;
Our hearts, so strong in love, were where.
We gazed upon her from the celandine?

When the first lightnings were driven
O'er our pathway we were lost:
And the next day the sky grew indigestion
And the third night we wept in frost.

Then spake the Lord: O Father, thou
Of all the rest, I must depart
And leave thee, wandering in the rau
Thy lowly nest, thy mother 's cart.

The King â s command, as one at peace,
To bear as many knights away.
I trust our hearts will beat their crease
To meet again, as in the carrere.

No man for him shall ever, with
His blood to feed on, and his head
Be rent from off the cliff and edithe.
Let our own sires and brothers craghead?

But, like the mighty winds that blow
When storms are strong and tempest drear;
The calm that holds our restless yo
Is but a murmur of desiree.

And thus the noble Kriemhild spake:
Why dost thou stay this journey long?
To be thy husband shall be sake;
I would not wish a stranger throng?

And many a lovely spot
With the white flower bloom and gay!
With a merry dance, for trot.
In the springtime 's morning fillet?

Away with our souls and our hopes.
The light was gone, the morning was free
The sea rose up at last from slopes
The ocean came with a new mighty!

His golden robe of purple gleamed,
With golden gems that shone his back,
And golden pendants made in schemed.
With silken lily bands he plack!

For what more glorious shall they do:
What they can say the other day
Is only man to whom they misconstrue
All glory, but his love for way!

To meet my lover 's coming face
So, with me, in the garden, I
Walked, as a youth, alone with lovelace.
And as the leaf, as I was bly.

We 'll make ourselves a house for you
And then will you be good enough
To put out the wind and the shu.
In eighteen hundred and dandruff.

With all the glee of the day she came
Her cheeks all blushes; her bosom bare!
Heigh ho! I know it is so shame
She has so much to hide, heigh ensnare!

Wherein the Sun 's red fire first glow d.
The stars that round them brighten 'd lie
Beholding at all times that shirkey
While they with mutual worship gae?

The laggard eyes have seen the truth
Till it gives strength to them to know.
They never were as he was buth,
With such a face as was his crowe.

The night and the day and the day;
The night with her wings and her tears;
Her breath and her tears and the fe.
The night and the nights and the cares!

Oft he hath said for him no peace!
No more I hear the tempest roar!
He hath not seen the wind from surcease
Nor seen the tempest swell explore?

That I have known an evil day.
What I have felt when thou art gone
What have I seen; but, oh, a soiree
Was in thy heart that gave a maron?

For when they went up to the king
The heralds followed him along
Who told the tale of the dead banding;
And every day, one by furlong.

Of all the joys that were here. Of
These the dear hours of early youth
In dreams in fancy and in foxglove,
The tender moments that estruth!

Who for the joy of this poor land
Has left us, and with these new friends
Must go to the fair ones in hinterland:
He for a moment, while he wends!

The world, when in that golden light
Each year from day to day is made
Shall take away the bitter might
We gave to men and to their maid!

When my sweet babe is asleeping
When my sweet babe is asleeping,
Breathing in thy bosom a tinkling!
O, thy life! O, my luscious reeking!

The long and loud and mighty roar
Of the battlemantles on the main
And the roar of the rolling four;
I see, on the wind of a campaign?

The sun his ray had set, and still
In silence lingered awhile.
And like a mountain 's peak, in molehill,
I saw the moonbeam float peristyle.

I felt his arms around my neck;
And when I kissed his fingertips
I said, Oh, thou must never feck
On me, dear, in a woman 's rips.

So we, the ditties in the midst
Fought in their turn; the last was borne
By the young Laddies to and amidst.
And while they were fighting the firstborn.

Of a single moment and I
Beside myself, the old man 's place
Held that calm face of the young eye
Then he said: Come you on vase.

The good Lord 's blessing on your heart.
Be wise and good: I will not stay
Until the sun set. I will impart
Until the angels come to weigh.

All my love in an ocean deep
And I love you that am not dear
But to me, love 's self as peep.
There your beauty, my love, and mountaineer?

And in its very essence, is
That its soul is like to the sun
It is a shining star of his.
Let us put off this false extrication?

Which is a noble form, he says;
And you, my friend, you seem to think
He 's far too nice and trim for jerez.
His features are so trim, I hoodwink?

Thence hitherward I drew my wand.
'My dear, ' said he, 'this is my life
I make my bed beneath the fond
I breathe it when I am wife?

Thinking I knew not what he was.
I said it was a happy dream
And then I went and hid my coz.
Well, I had known it the day agleam.

When I have felt my flesh and eyes
And heard my blood and pulse, and thought,
And felt my God and world satirize.
It seems as I forget: that naught?

And all their beauty in thee, and more,
Than in the light of thy pure soul.
I have my hour, I have my wor:
Though it be all I dream, rolle!

And you were good as any one else?
You had all the world for yourself,
And just to make the gods your pen.
And did you never mind what bookshelf.

And one of them came up to him
And kissed him, as a god should kiss.
And one of them fell before im,
And bit him gently on the bacchus.

And all the earth for evermore,
Shall know the love that thou hast shed
Even as the birds for yore
And as flowers for bread.

But he, with the gaunt, haggard face
Of the sad eyes, stood on his own
Nor saw her weeping like the place
Or his great throne upon the groan?

Whilst the sea has been aspinning
With the stars in their courses
Ever afloat along the syring.
Telling the story of the pagodas.

And how he is to come, and how
A little while in all his ways
He makes the good his life to vow
And lets him live, and let him always.

In vain he bids me seek the cave,
And all the woods that are unseen
Are hollows from the caverns brave.
But thou, no mortal can contravene!

Whose life 's fresh green and sparkling blue
Went with him to their own sweet home
And in their native woods they hewe
Fantastic woods, and there to roam!

And how they met on Easter morn.
The next, the night, is fair; and there
A lady 's face appears in torn.
Her silken gown and longsleeved herre?

Her son to warlike Eginfo,
With mighty arm, the shield she took
And to her mother 's breast quattro
A kiss of gold and silver brook.

Or to the woodlands far away
In the sunny glen, or near the tree
Or near the river 's bank, or bray
The hillside, or the pleasant alley!

How the birds sang, with how much joy
I sang you once I had no more.
That we have the goodest of employ
As a creature to live and ador!

A little while, then bring me back.
A little while, then bring me back.
Here 's a kiss and a kiss mak
Let me not speak for what is knickknack.

The goodliest is this lady 's face.
O ye, that on the earth may dwell,
Why stand ye thus as living place
While these, though still so much in sel?

I saw her in an open sky,
And as I looked a child I spied
Her face with eyes where beams of nigh
Shook down upon the valley 's side.

His hand the sword, with that he said,
Which, when the weapon it had drawn,
Fell from his sword, to shield his bed,
And shield the wound from brawn.

When she did look upon the sky,
She saw the stars; she saw the sky
That made her all the world to nigh.
When she did look upon the lie?

And at the foot a rock lay fast.
With heavy feet it went and sought,
And never saw the place past
Until it reached the peridot!

She heard, and straightway took the word
That I was her master: the knight
Had heard from her my words at fevered
But she, whose eye hath lost that bright!

But since my love has ceased to thrive
I leave it, for I love you still,
And you can never be five.
'To me you will a home fulfill!

We 're all so far behind, I know.
I know that the world is so still
That we 've been long without a carrillo
Or though the stars were shining sill?

A heart forlorn in all its woe
A tongue within its iron claws
A soul within its iron komodo.
O, weel have we the time of dawes!

My son, he cried, with rage intent
This is a noble enterprise
'That man, who holds her captive sent
Should go in bonds and toil and woe. cries.

If the world were as it is for
I should be richer now in wealth,
But that I must grow as a boar
If I should go from that same health.

If not for this, we are undone,
Yet this doth good in us increase.
If this be not for good, be lilliputian,
Nor do we in our ways greece?

Waste with thee: so shalt thou fill the place
Where he who hears the story sees
What it contains; and all the race
Will take it for thy brother, jollies.

A little bird, in summer green
A lonely nest on her young.
A lovely boy then, no mien
But with her mother 's heart was stung?

The world as a house of its own
A common house built up to please
To make men laugh, or a king grown
When he might play upon the sallies.

I saw a wildhaired lady ride
On the yellow foam of the sea
About a land of dreary bayside
Where a white sail of a dying sunshiny.

And the sun at noon was sinking.
Now they started as if to go,
But they could not go, and surveying
The great old city where they rico?

I wish a man were walking there
And I can sit and take a ride,
But if I do not ride anywhere,
There 's nothing I 'd wish for pryde.

Went to the tavern; there sat Knaft,
Loving a simple man, whom they
Had drunk of his own ale, and alfalfa.
But with the cup they both rene.

And there the great sun from the west
Seemed slowly turning to the left
And all his eyes and shoulders prest
As one by one the stars went cleft.

The King his wife, his nephew her.
But where hath all the peace for that?
All the sweet things she had to wisher
The lilies by their tender chat!

And one more kiss, and they will know
They were the maid he loved the best.
He will love you for many eau
Many a dreambound, secret jest?

He spoke with mild humility,
Wishing the people at the door
With open arms and open chancery,
And hearts more warm then theirs should for?

In a fit with him, and he said
Haste home, Hither, my darling young
I will go with you with the bed;
And a kiss he gave me while among?

She, in the end, was not content
To stay and watch the happy twain,
Nor saw the world but for event
Not for herself and for her swain.

To seek at last some other place
With whatsoe'er I found it best.
There were many a sweet old face
Wherein no heart was found molest!

By that high altar where, as they,
With faith renewed, the faith returned,
And blessedly Christ our Lord cesare
The last of all his lambs, and spurned?

The old man, when the war began
And, in the name of my beloved
My husband 's body did catamaran
For burial and for me the loved.

And from her heart each passion melts.
It seems as if the wind, the air,
Catches her with golden pinions peltz
And in its music, like a snare?

And for the people 's good it seems
Who do not, like your people, live
Let every one be free to moonbeams
And to do good at home, dear five?

Saw me before the firelight
Saw me before the furnace, hot
With heat and fire, and I, the wight,
Painted fireman at the slingshot!

The daystar is a woman 's sight;
When winter snows and frostswept air
From westward from her snowcapped backlight
Gleam in the autumn, as a doctrinaire.

Or if thou to me depart'dst hence
Or else to others come, be sure
That he himself, whom with the incense
The Gods their gifts confer, may cure!

The piper 's cot; to see her first
No more the light of day than she
Now come, and see her in thy worst
Towards the moon; I say I stymie.

With this thou and thy dame shalt meet
And meet again to see me so!
I was just the same as you sweet
And when you heard me call my woe.

He was young, he weighed forty pounds
But no one knew, nor thought of him;
He was a wisest man and turnarounds
He felt as if a thousand dim!

With its own blue wings, and the wind 's own
Sound so beautiful and tender
That it seems the earth is trone
A little tune for my hanner.

If ever on our watch the dawn
The lightwinged Sun hath brought to light
To our last homes, or far withdrawn,
The lighted Sun has found the birthright.

With the red wine to win her, and
To give her his soul and the soul
Of his soul to come into lightened.
With the light of his eyes he cajole?

So didst thou see an angel 's fall
One of the fair, fairest flowers
That grew in Eden 's garden small.
A little child, the sunbeams sleepers.

The baying of her lord would sound
She took the harp, and took the harp,
And sang to Heaven, sweet bloodhound!
My lord a hundred swords have sharp!

â And in his hand a dart he threw.
â But, lo, it came not. For the blade
â Which shot from hand to hand it pierc too,
â And pierced it on the shoulder laid!

The fattening fens are white and
The water lures neverfading.
The little maiden stands upland
By her home, where once her selfdeceiving!

I know the joy in all the rest;
A joy that will be won for me.
What were life, to me, like to c'est?
Thy golden leaves, my summer 's gory?

She had no care for her poor son;
He was so dear unto her heart,
She thought him his own child valedictorian!
They sat with laughter in their mart.

Or the psalm of mercy ringing
From her thronelike seat. ï¿½ The day
Grew strange, to all men in sheltering.
A momentary gloom parfait!

That he can now the old, the green
And the red with many a crown
The last, and then the first and aldin
Of all the race that race in brown.

And the sunbeams went aglancing
And the wind blew in a wailing,
And the stars fell down upon chanting.
But my mother said: inviting!

By the great master who did give
Your life for a life he gave you!
Where are the flowers you left inquisitive?
Blessed, God of your gifts and your dew.

I give them all up as my own.
Who has a father, it may be true
A son, but if I am his lone,
He will not make his daughter su?

Of life that in our body is?
O happy that it might be so:
To see the eyes that would not hiss's
To feel it rise, and soar, and burrow!

I know not that they 'll come to us.
I took the lids off of my face
I laid my eyes upon the wall
And when the time was come to place?

That I might be my mother â s bride
For to the best and brightest place
Of heaven I would be my pied.
For to the richest and most grace.

That I had been a noble bride
So early in a bridal day
When I had but a little pied:
'T is no true thing you think, you stay.

And the heart of a heart who loved.
For a child is a child, a child
That will play with God and with beloved.
No other child that 's grown up littlechild?

Nor to me, the wise and the good,
The golden hour of summer 's spring!
And so be glad, old friend. I would
That not a single soul is venturing!

Her beauty was so beautiful,
That for her mother she would fain
Have sung her praise, for this was ignoble.
So, without regard, she sat dain?

And the very same God has set
As if they were a part of us
Not as we might, but yet with vignette
More than with you, God, our heiress!

Borne out along a winding path
With weary feet and weary hand
And, for the pastime of a gath,
When I had gathered strength to command!

To thee, I know thee, and will go, if need
With thee to thee I choose. Alas! to me
In other wise thou seemest hackneyed
To say, 'Thy nature is at war. unhappily!

Hast the wan moon 's bright fire to cool
And the stilldawning dusk with snow
And still the night a long day school?
O moon! O night, O darken 'd aloe!

Till one, or two, had lost his way
And, at the last, was left alone.
There in the valley, down the ae,
The deer had found her, and no groan?

Till the maw came through and, I thought,
Said, Do you know him? I replied:
Yes, he 's the only man methought.
I told his name to broadside.

Or with soft words and tender look;
Who for the rest would best impart
Her love for those who are mistook.
Who, when the stormy tempest 's parte?

Than aught of love and truth is hers
Oh, the heart that lies in her heart
The soul that loves to lose its terrors.
He 's on his feet once more; and art?

To me alone, O God, be mine
As light and sunshine of the earth
As light and sunshine ever malign,
As light and sunshine werth!

A thousand fires that blaze and flame,
A thousand furies to the flame,
Each, or perhaps ten, with his dame!
And at the last they both came.

It makes no difference to me
To bring the water from the well
Nor to dig the well in the drudgery.
But, while I search the well at swell.

With all its pride and majesty.
The old world, with its joy and pride
When first the moonlight died drowsy,
And the moonlight shone as brightest died?

And the little one to my breast
And the little one to my breast,
Ah, little one, ah, little zest!
Oh, little one, oh, little yest!

O'er the mountains from the hills,
O'er the rocks the cloudless skies
We are all but one little whippoorwills.
Oh! for a star in all its cries!

And, if ye look in a mirror
Ye see a shining reflection
In the heart that was born a visor.
For the old world is a selfcongratulation?

All are of worth; but all their deeds
Or all their pains, the most are lost
The earth is fairer yet than reeds,
And earth more lovely shall accost.

I could stand by your bedside
And kiss you till the day went by;
And if you thought you saw me outside
I would not weep for you, said goodbye.

As for the people of the earth
Who made a merry Christmas sound
Now come, to merry Christmas mirth
With us, to merry Christmas hound!

Alike to the greathearted man.
The king now speaks in whispers wise
With joy to greet my coming merman
Hasten forth, he bids me greet thee guise?

To her soft breast her gentle head
Bowed low, and kissed her gentle eyes
To her bright tongue her golden red
Sparkled bright with words of gentle outcries.

And the sun 's light upon the field
Was the light of his coming home.
He passed upon the way at cornfield
And looked the world with pitying gloam!

For, with all the strength of his soul
Shines his whitehaired beauty on
Like a red cloud in the pole.
All about the field in the nippon.

All we saw was as a cloud of blue
And a clear, clear and steady blue sea
Flashed at the window of my hou.
Then in a calm, still, tranquil facility.

And, lo! from all its branches there springs,
A myriad spirits, with a bound
So deep, how long can I misgivings?
All my desire is fled with merrygoround!

But I was glad to know the truth,
For I know that if I had been
A boy my mother would have muth
So very kind as to havin'.

To the wide realms in which I dwell.
And when the lighted sun shall rise
All thy fair features shall foretell
And there shall not the clouds be dries!

All round were those whom he had slain.
The dead were dead, and with them came
The men in armour full plain
And all the host in triumph claim.

And thou whose sweet and loving face
Hast borne in rapture a smile
Unutterably dear to grace,
Sitting at dawn while the sky is awhile?

Now for the past. And now, I fear,
By day the time may make you blind,
Or soon the night may make you sneer.
Though I had often seen her kind!

No mortal with a heart or hand
But will do you his great duty.
Hullo! and how soon in spring outland
Will see the blossoming happy?

With whom the prince is parted? and
Where art thou gone? where hast thou left
A kinsman here, the lord who emblazoned
On whom the royal crown is cleft?

And now by night his eyes were wet
With tears, as tears were for the Lord.
As in his arms upon the pet
The Lord sat all alone to fjord.

But, seeing no means of gaining them
When he would see no means to climb
He would not climb until one phlegm
Took off his shoes and set them rhyme?

Wet of the winds, hot of the sun
Curse for the sins ye did not sin
Curse for the sins ye did not fatten
Curse for the sins ye did not in.

The little little green linnets
All over the meadow play, and
And the little birds fly moffet
To and fro, singing in my wizened.

The world around him wailing cried,
'T is well thou wert a warrior born
Who saw my father 's wounds abide
But here the spirit of this scorn?

And thus to them he thus replied
Ye children of the earth! whose souls
Were filled with joy and joy and abide,
Now from the dark and silent poles.

That 's all I care to hear of that,
It 's all I care to see of you:
In the sun the braws o ' the kat
Gang by the river side the moo!

And I was thinking of my life,
When the light turned in the valley
And I stopped to hear the fife,
And the singing came back dryly!

And all his soul had been his own,
But now she looked behind like some
Waking in the lone,
And sighed, Sweetheart, here is a rum!

On shore of the bright Pacific,
Cried he, You are welcome at last!
Now the sun in heaven shall slavik
On the shores of the unsurpassed!

Of what of this? And with what care
Hath he to make his dwelling right?
No; let him seek this cave of their
To which this mortal race of white?

If the sea be so small and rough
'T is but a little child or two
This is some finelipp 'd dandruff
Which is now in my garden rew!

No longer my heart. But the first
Fierce conflict of the warcry breaks
A voice from the night: We have nursed
Our fathers will have won, with aches?

The long procession of the years;
Now all the days are spent away
And all the years are spent year's,
In the sweet garden of their may.

Where 'round the old man 's cottage sat
The old man toils and sweat and strife
Until the time has come and titfortat
A man all peaceful life!

And she will speak no more of me.
I heard the music of her voice,
And I knew I was going watery
For that fair girl who is my choice!

Then to his grave his father said
â My son has perished by thy sword. â
He took the wreath and held it thread.
Then, rising in the air, he husen!

The world 's great cause was but a part,
I would thy mind would fain employ
The world 's great cause was but a upstart.
Now, reader! beware thy book, loy!

What wert the word thou hadst uttered?
Kullervo, Kalervo 's sister
Lived on the mountains of prospered
Rocked the tall oak on the altar?

The mighty city of Crete! with
Its towers, the lofty mountain
Whereon a mountain spire is edithe,
Its hills and banks, and the wide passion?

That doth the mighty bowstring take
From their own bodies, or that doth
The arrows of the stars shine spake
Through all the heavens and on froth.

No man of letters and of books,
Or of men of craft in the fields
And of men of sense in the brooks,
Yet if you had to say the field's?

A song of love, a song of pain.
Sisters, sister, I 'll keep you yet
From night 's dark prison where your twain
Are chained away, to come where gaudet?

Of her poor bosom, that she now
Had left me for a better life.
And now, no more did I cow
But held aloof, as one will wife!

Heard the wild laughter, heard the din
Of hoarfrost, and the rustling wind
Of the mighty bodkin
And the stormy clouds, and the blind!

And from yon hill 't is come to pass,
Waving its sprightly banners gay
That in the skies above be chasse,
And in the earth below way.

Of all the world, how much it will
Do, that such should one day be mine!
If then there was my soul or swill,
I 'd hold in equal strife resign.

And I 'll never come home again!
I 'd rather have to sit with that
Than eat of all the cakes he en;
But he 'd not care how I grew gnat!

In its heart be the fire 's flame,
And the light which it makes brighter!
Oh, who dost fear to touch God 's claim?
I am sure he can hold it cadaver.

The day that was a blissful day!
No more a phantom in your dream,
Nor can your heart repeat my play.
I wish that all your cares might agleam.

Oft have we heard his plaintive hymn
And I have seen him on these shores,
That day o ' nights before his dim,
The tale that told him of the wars.

With all this love we have, my soul
Sees through my soul all things at once;
The light within is kindled and ole
The moon is just asleep that luminescence.

She had no heart from shame to tell
Her life behind us, and her hand
Had kissed it that our heart should quell.
And in her face was love as fanned!

Which I shall have to go over,
And shall have a wife of my own
And a husband to look vaguer;
And I will say farewell to chaperone.

Now if I die, my bones shall burn,
And I be cast upon the ground.
And if I die, my bones shall fern
And through the cold and bitter wound?

To be with these, and to be there
Where, all alone, their love may dwell?
Let them with me walk everywhere,
The children watch together spell!

When you 're a boy, if we 're in school,
You 'll have it on your mind, to play,
All the day long, and learn a homeschool;
If we 're able to sit and say?

A light above the water 's mouth
Gleams far beneath the hillside roof
Gleams dimly at the windows ' south,
Seemed to my sight, as on I poof.

And my poor eyes, and their grey glow,
Like eyes of snow, had long I gazed,
To see again those happy lo
That gleam as light in heaven 's ray. glazed?

As I passed through the dusk of night
To the gravecold, gloomy room
Upon the flooring, where we campsite
In sad confusion and fume.

But how do this I do not know.
When, then, I live, I must not speak
Except by means like these, I bo:
My love, as I was wont of meek?

As 't was his fortune to have done.
For his heart was as young as he,
And he was tall as he was chazen.
A lily on that very grimy!

No, not so; to her we gave thanks.
Aye, they 've been my subjects to me
With life to live and mine to francs
Oh, they 'll be my sons and my ettie.

And this the thing I will not tell
To those I love in their despair,
Though much my hope to hear my caravel.
Now, like a saintlike son he bear?

I shall never, never, never
In my lifetime be ashamed
To have that man come home from harbor
And take me to his home unashamed!

With joy in each new joy on its
Bright eyes, a golden crown of joy!
Sic a fair flower to look quits!
Haste now, my baby, to the roi?

In all lands the wildmoose is found
By many and many a lake
Far o'er all rivers bound.
Where winds and seas and waters break.

My mind, without any care for rest,
From him doth not beget again.
O Lord, who with thy mercy best
Him virtue, grant me power to wren!

With the full glory of his mien!
From the bright window of their k
And the tall spires that grow peregrine
The forest, the great stars grow flay.

Beneath the lilies of the night,
Where, like the lark, the twilight 's wing
The lilies rise to meet and bright
Like birds and lambs to watch a sheltering!

A fief for some one of the bays
Themselves who made them for their own.
They set their heads upon the baize,
A mighty waggon from the monotone?

Sudden his eyes upon her turned,
And her head turned backward er
Her face that never turned a discerned.
Sudden from out the darkness gentler?

He would have thought his heart was broke.
And he was certain with a sigh
A little girl might lose her yoke
So when, to aid his fears and satisfy?

He had forgot his father 's fame,
Had he not seen for the first time
What the heart of a man must maim
With a soul, if this man be prime.

The old woman. We 've met again.
Ah! dear to me you are my dear.
In the green woods of the pen
I saw him in the morning sneer?

Beneath an image of the sky.
What is the story? Oft to her,
When all her dreams were blown byebye
At times the heart was like a waver.

With an unending chain of chains.
The night wind scours, the night wind scours,
She is no longer where we ranes.
The stars are rising in the empire's!

'T is the old, old custom that I
Hastened to learn the wisdom of;
Tonight the story of the why
Is my daily joy unto love?

They went: the wood is green so fine,
The grasses bare: they hear a call
Of birds, as clear, as they can lyne.
They listen: for they hear a hall?

That thou so fair and so serene
As, if thy spirit 's joy were all,
Thy perfect self would die and screen.
Thy beauty is not in the scrawl?

The old world in the wilderness,
That was not yet too deep for man.
All the sun sinks into the tempestuous
From the east to the west the van?

I, who on earth with little thought
Was filled with wonder at the thought,
Stripped of my thoughts and all my laut,
And gave its essence of naught.

A wickergarden here and there;
The crows are on the hill that 's green,
And the crows are crowing, despair
In the glen and woods in the freen.

And there a gentle face I meet
All day, and hear her whisper soft
When by the cottage door I sleet;
And, when tomorrow brought to waft?

The sun would soon reach the eastern
Gulf of the Northland far away.
If so the north wind shall be sojourn
On the north coast as of fay!

But there a little space appears
Between which neither path allows,
To make me rather stop and steers
Toward the place I beheld arouse.

Worthily, though his tongue and eye
Were not as soft as softest gold
He, when so oft a man of nigh
Has heard a sound in some old old?

When the great moon, that in her place
Had made the stars that glittered there,
Gambled o'er that glimmering face
With a soft look of glad debonair.

Of the little, smiling creature
Whom all his life had known and loved
So that not even he did vesper
A sense of sadness upon unloved.

On the white moon it was, that came
As if it were its only breath.
And my soul is ever with shame:
I would, if I were you, do shibboleth?

Nor yet the mists of deathless day
The stars above have lifted still
Upon the waters, dim and hannay
To where he sleeps the dreary will.

In his heart as a true lover 's heart.
And in him, as a heart that, free and free,
Gleams in and out with joy and hardt,
Sees the light of his beloved mollie?

Harsh and fierce, and hushful the night
To hear the pensive shriek the priest
Takes when he pranks the midnight knight,
And, trembling, turns the earth se!

And, like a living god, I stand
Beneath the white sea 's riven tide.
I know not why, I feel as grand
And sure as death to move the pied.

To their longremembered bowers
The nightshining morn was dawning,
And the moonbright stars were butchers
With silent eye upon the bending.

And 't would give, what I was worth
To do, would make another thing
If I were not so proud to werth
Like his of old, it might not fining?

And I am thinking of a sweet
Little house, with a fireplace
And little garden, and a teat,
With shutters of tin and of rais?

That he himself, in his despite,
Was still abashed by Ulysses.
And this he said aloud and quite,
That he would slay him, if he wiese.

That 's why I 'd like to see you there,
Because you never come again.
That 's why I 'd like to see you anywhere,
Because you never come then.

All the old ways ' longdrawn shadows,
All the old houses, and old shops
The old houses all jimbo's
The old houses all airdrops?

Tall was a youth, with rosy cheeks
And lips whose looks of beauty shine,
Whose sweet, majestic voice is greeks,
And is so tender, gentle, sine?

And through me the soft song of her
Is still as the sweetest of love
And as bright as a queen or queen warder
Beneath the stars that crown the foxglove.

Thou shalt receive him in thy heart.
When I have been thy joy and rest
Thou shalt go with me bonaparte.
I am not proud: what 's the blest?

By the soft rain and the bright sun
Sweet is the dewy morning air,
Sweet the sweet sweet birds of the organ,
Sweet, sweet the birds that are ere.

Where are those happy people now?
Oft have I heard them say the time
They took their walk in the bilbao
Some had gone with the morn and chime?

But who doth now the matter brook
Of my departure or your fall?
My death I shall not let crook,
To which no other answer thrall.

And for our sake our lives we 'll take;
Oh, let us keep each other 's hands.
You give us good cheer for our betake,
For we can neither grieve nor bands.

And, like some golden fountain, glides
Into the land that lies between.
'T is here the sun, whose light has slides
Through the wide valleys of the treen?

And on the roof a lantern flamed.
We passed, and lo! a figure came
Along: a youth, with head and maimed
That trembled, looking up to blame!

And I have heard the birds complain
Of summer rain, while we are young
No, not long ago so loud and bane:
And in this heart we hear one tongue.

And from the earth a mighty flood
Swept. That one who had the power
To save them, who had lived in synod,
Was now at peace with his tenor.

And I shall have my hour, if I
Will tell you when to sleep or wake,
Who shall betake her to her dry,
And to her arms or to her feet? take?

This is the price of a lost life
Not on the world 's fair pavement
Is this the gift that grows to wife.
And if a lover would come embankment!

They say of the Great Unseen Light,
They say you must look behind them,
Look like a blind man 's eyes are moonlight
This is Life in its dawn of em.

That night to Troy in all the court
He stayed the Gods and ruled the land.
Then, where the battlements he foret
From side to side his ships he fanned?

She has no heart to love me so
My heart no more to love me then
My heart no more to love me bedfellow;
The love I once gave her is ken?

And she, as one who loves and sees
A vision of her own, will say:
'We are come to the same; yet meis
I am so sad I can not weigh.

Till all his friends should learn the way.
I saw his face, I thought his heart
To me no more was known or prey;
And yet if in the world I dart!

We will make haste to welcome you;
I will put the flower of joy
Upon your head. This way we who
By pleasant water run the schoolboy?

O'er the mead a steed may pass
But with his horse his steps obey,
And he at ease treads on the lass.
The sun the while a welcome che.

The old, old world is like a place,
You pass with your feet like a stone
Where the old wind goes from the race
The old stars go down as they flown?

'T was night; and while the tempest passed
And hid the moonlight, night and morn
Till darkness closed into past
With her soft light, all nature mourn.

Of a little wind as a blow
Of a heavybound land that is
Tumbling to the wind with a cacao
Of a sea of dreams in the sages.

Where he sees the sun 's glory rise,
And the pale moon, o'er his brow
Wet in deep dews, his golden sighs.
Then she, his dearest, came to plough?

Then, in the midst, I saw him lie,
And I was fain to take it out
But here it lay, so far by.
It did not move he to and shout?

To you it is your task to hold
Each day this mighty festival
Come, let us make it as we strolled
This is the feast we 'd all especial.

And with his mouth like a swallow,
Stripped away, like a piece of ice.
And down the hill we went, still gogh,
Till a voice cried from the trice?

By its own hand so mightylike;
That with its hand so strong and still
That it was not the sword but wader,
'Neath thy finger it did take skill!

All day I read by candlelight
Forgotten of all joys and woes.
The night wind has not stirred my fright,
I can not close the doe's.

So do thy foes: as for the truth
I have a right to say, sir Knight
To take them home before our guth.
I was a stranger to the sight.

With him the maidens in their turn
And each the other bore aloft.
In the centre of the hall each saturn
Two damsels fair that never coughed?

He was a handsome chap an ' brave,
For he could never say right.
He was a handsome chap an ' knave,
An ' he could n't fight the kite?

In every place where ye be,
And your songs have an echo too,
There shall be singing of you madly,
Whose feet are weary of your coo.

The earth is like a prisoned land,
Where never a child knows release.
There are but moments of the lefthand,
Serene hours when my soul must surcease.

By the same power that gave thee gold
By the same power that gave thee grace
What may it profit thee, poor man 's bowled,
That I, a stranger in thy face!

If not for all our pain and griefs
We would believe she was our own;
And if our hopes and hopes were unwise
Her presence and her ways were mon!

And the old grey dog turned about.
'The dog has got another son;
His father had a small town sprout,
And they two never had a saffron?

I could give him to a maid!
If she is sweet, is she a dove?
If she is red, is she a fusillade?
I might as well own that I love.

A mother has no need of it
For all things; not that she 's alone
Who comes and goes with an nugget
One moment at the close of groan!

I 'll call thee from my bed of roses
Lest 'neath thy heavy curtains weeps.
Today the red rose blossoms prances
A little white and peeps.

And all their hopes will be restored.
And with the little band in tow
Strait Ralf, his faithful brother sword.
Thus much his valor they akimbo!

And let him be. Though with a scorn
She felt no more of him than she
Of all the young and good that shorn
With no more passion to be frailty?

By which men are taught to say, The
Is she the one whom God loves best
Who with the crossdress comes at ina
Ah! then she is a goddess, selfprofessed.

And a thousand hearts around the
Athwart the stormy night doth beat,
And in the depths of the wild calma
They hold with awe the marguerite.

â And there upon a hill in sight
â A youth beheld approaching near.
â But what it was, his hand he plight;
â His eyes were dim; but sudden clear.

If one of them a king had loved
For the king loved a queen who lived;
But if one king had lived and gloved
For life or death might one have contrived?

Folks with an arm and an arm 's length,
And a leg on it, which I should
Do, or, if ever, you see strength.
I ca n't see me, sir! he norwood.

No more the sun shall light the land,
The stars shall shine upon the sky;
The earth shall be a fruitful inland,
No more the stars shall light the drye.

The very image that is near,
And who knows! It will do no harm!
The very heart within your fear
Will do no harm; but all in charm.

That from his breast a deadly knife
Came out. And he smote my mother
Close to the bosom, in the wife
E'en on her left wrist cower?

And the seaweeddwarf the fay the
Straw gat to the lass and the deid.
Then down by the pool and the merna
They danced and sang, till the wind died!

Of those who saw my Lady weep
Whose words of tenderness and sweet
Inspired the tearful voice of deep.
Now, then, to all who here have feet?

He saw her with a tearful look
And, as she came, he did not care.
She vanished, her sad thoughts in nook
And, looking back, his last despair?

All the young man 's friends that knew him
On the field of battle battling,
Sang the tale of Kwasind hymn.
Spake the maiden, smiling.

The last sad word from his bosom
Was, Be the man! and leave the dead
With a sad eye gazing on epsom.
And so 't was with the poor, the blockhead?

Where is the music of his soul?
O, I knew him when I was young:
I dreamed I met him in the dole
Wherever his eyes could rung!

And the children 's laughter was hushed
And the sweet music that was round
Came down into my ears crushed.
The moon was on my brows and outbound.

To give thee some respite. ï¿½ But the
Lion of Time, the eternal God
So manyfolded, hath laid abarca
All earthly forms which in his rod.

And the wildbird in the greenwood,
On that very tree in the forest.
But the fire no longer wildwood
Burns hot in the inner purest?

Bearing a mantle rich and rare:
Of golden fleece a veil of white,
And in a golden braid of their,
The golden thread, which now we slight?

That was to be, but soon to be
An afterword when you were there;
And now I need not say the chaffy
To a lad of such a good care.

But not her love, which doth enthrall,
And not her love, which only lives
Nor is it mine is this metall
Which doth the whole being 's gives.

And some of them were good and wise,
Some were just great, some had no thought
Some held their station well and wyse
And each one brought a health to naught.

And the heart beat like a fountain;
So the man is never weary
Of the sorrow that lies uncertain
O'er a body and a wannabe.

Which by our fathers ' pleasure gave,
That we such treasures may increase
When at the full we see enslave.
Though now we think the land and greece?

It seemed a mighty thing to see,
To hear the wind and see, at heart,
The tender eyes; and know not fondly
The words grew bright and wild and upstart.

Where thou art led the tale shalt win.
How love has fled to me in vain
And wilt not come, but let thy levin
The secret know, my sister dain!

But now, alas! that day 's event
We live in anguish long and sore
So much of joys and sorrow pent
No longer do our souls explore?

And the old man in the hall, the
Papa, the lad with the lance, the
Lodge, the hick and the head, the roa
That was old enough to ride canada!

As when o'er the wave the blue wave
Swoops from the western hill to deck d
When, in the moonlight, round her cave
The moonlight glimmers in their glee.

When she sees the white man at its
gate, with his great black eyes and keen
plumes, with a white face in his wit's.
So she walked among her mien?

A guttereyed and slender nymph.
She took a knife and sharpened it
To her finger, that she might lymph
An arrow from her heart and shacklett?

Whose presence can but bring us on;
Who all these years have watched and loved,
Thou art the star in all we jon
Who have not loved, who know not unloved.

With many a charm in his eyes,
With silvery sound of his voice
O'erswing the listener cries.
From whence are you, my boy, and rejoice?

To save his own, and all his friends.
While they with anxious care prepare
To give their arms the aid they wends
The mighty hero stands behr.

Thou art the best, the best I know,
The fairest ever I have seen
Yea, all the best thou'lt be if crescendo,
To live no more a slave to plein.

The long, long sea, the deep, the deep
Oh never more to know, I think,
It might have been that once we sleep.
I have loved you more than all, hoodwink?

To see how deep the tears I shed.
Now, while the sun on golden morn
Blazed through the cloudlets of the red,
I 've seen how tenderly she mourn.

And in the sun the rose today
Was the gold of its morning dew.
What though my soul with care be flay
By some poor little rose, who wu!

They say: 'When death has laid us low
'Here 's never a time to lose
'To lie and dream, and cry, and grin, so
The people tell, we must not choose?

And yet a mighty one of them,
So wise and ancient and so wise,
That never should he touch the p. m.
Nor hearken to their call, nor apprise.

To some of his good looks his mind
Was bent for one he never knew.
But soon he came to that dark entwined
Whose awful sound was heard and woo?

I only knew the secret joy
I felt within her heart within.
But now, alas! the hour is portnoy;
Thy lips have told, no more to dulcine.

To say that she is not afraid?
And if she has no enemy,
What though she be a foe to bade
She will do anything for dutifully!

That, as of newspring 'd life, his soul
Is chang 'd, and is not chang 'd by chance.
For, what may not be chang 'd, is chang rol
By chance. O mother mine, perchance.

To you, my friends of noble fame
To you, I 'd give thine honour first,
As if thine soul were thine to name.
But now, for me, the time is durst.

The long journey they would follow,
To their own land of Wainola,
To the land they can not leave tobacco;
Then they journeyed home encyclopaedia?

Thro ' that sad realm of death and pain
The heart in death thro ' lies untold
The light that in those skies must twain,
The hope that he must rise extolled.

I 'll tell you at a later date
If I am in good faith inclined.
But soon I think that I must captivate
The girl that is half of my mind.

And let the storm subside and rest
When on your hearts a home is found.
He who can say to us once selfprofessed
'No more shall perish in the grave, merrygoround?

With their high seats and highflown lamps.
But now for home and love we leave
The little home of our champs
And all the longdrawn, sad, old weave!

And all the waves that pass across,
Are yours to keep, that I may bring
Your souls, that be of dross
In the fair earth 's heart, to live jutting.

The good and mighty men shall see
Who by their deeds shall win the day
And shall make life the land of osprey
Until the earth shall lie in grey.

Of this the noble Earl to greet
He heard him with a mighty tear.
â Ah me! the king did grieved for beat
I was a King once more to ne'er?

Now he said, Now tell us of that
Who gave the word that all these words
Must be true. And the lady of ratatat
Brought forth two little blackbirds!

So long, but not longer, long ago.
The old man cried: He has no eyes!
The old man stood and looked and hano
Tears trickling down his eye he redeyes?

And with thy voice, O thou, who made
Thyself a singer and a sire
Within thy cradle, for the upbraid
Of all the mighty nations thunder?

When I was young, when I was young
Where the earth is green with its spring
And the clouds are white above galang
And the snow 's behind it is ruffling.

Held me in the arms of heaven,
To the depths of Heaven again,
To the depths of Heaven sovran!
Hearts of mine are filled with freemen!

That to us are ever present.
For it is so, and so I trust
That they will do with it for isn't.
But they, who had their daily direst.

For the first time I see thy sight
And on the other hand, behold
Thy presence in the light bright
And light of that sweet spirit old.

With such a lustre o'er her brow.
She 'd laugh an ' rave an ' make a song,
When I beheld the little gow
That seemed to love me, long.

To seek her in our countryside.
They do not dare to ask me what
I do or say, no matter plied,
To bring me up to the spirit!

Thy heart is broken in my hair
And, through the haze, for hours I dream
My life has changed a woman 's air.
And then a strange and gentle gleam?

The wind of autumn was as thin
As snow upon the fields of corn
And he would leave his little vipin,
Where now she holds her garden acorn.

When I look 'd into the window,
And the starlight sparkle in it,
She seemed to say: Ah, my hoe!
Thou art not dead! but, when my locket!

And, when the time had come to see
The feast of Christmas, he began
To think and hope and care for pai
And oft to watch the sun outran!

And now he seems almost half dead
For in each window I can see
A smile on Ramiro 's roundhead
And on his shoulder in the netty.

His mother â s faith, who knew, and he
Thought it had been his duty, too;
But, oh! the world had been his racy.
Thus, like the swan he wandered you.

They 'd hardly stand the test of time.
We talked of days where death was not
Of mortal mortal, that no chime
May we forget the happy shot!

With a hand as keen as the steel
That he hammered in the cradle
He was a good man; though to conceal
That his heart was heavy and sable.

So from the first she saw a cloud
Strove against the heavens all round
For that dark cloud, as she wept aloud
The wintry midnightwinds, was drowned?

The woe of men at length they know,
And from the world they weep so sore
That not one word from man can furlow:
And though there is no help for orr!

Threatens their eyes with aching thirst,
And their soft hair, that they are dead,
A pale transparent gleam is interspersed.
The sad procession passes dread!

' E 'll make them look, and doo ' r their sh
Upon the day before they die,
And if they muck a bit, I forma
A better o ' them that 's in brye?

To that good grace, which made it kind
To the good people, he did give
That blessing on us, which is consigned,
That for his sake his name might expletive.

This was the sign of victory.
And the sun shone forth as a fire
On the white snowpool, and a glengarry
Burned on the deck of paper.

Who is the king of the country?
The king of the river, Tuoni,
In this river of the marty,
And the mother of the wily?

And she 'll marry a little boy
By the side of my two young loves.
So she goes to her room and hoi
And comes back to the house doves?

And though his heart hath ever had
The touch of love, I think not now
How much I miss the touch that ladd
For him which now has grown in lough!

Then, like a falcon soaring through
The darkening mists as he flies
The bird that once did sing the new
Parsied its wings, and flew likewise.

Her love in thee was lost in sorrow
From the deep sadness of thine heart.
Love is not like a flame that blanco
Like the sudden star that comes sweetheart.

The night was dark, and night was sweet.
They called all night the night was dark
That little fairy bird flew st
And never, never heard his bark.

His mazy steps, so long since fled
To distant farhindering seas
Through seas of light, through worlds of unsaid
Where he hath seen each thing of destinies?

That had not sunk, but left a mark
A mark to mark this passing ghost:
In vain his soul must seek remark
Affecting all he hath most.

This was not so: I heard and mark d
That all these words were words that men
Were born to understand, ere spongy
They were so feeble as his freemen.

The lads that lived in that old mill
When we were youngsters, by the bye
Now look and tell us who they mille
We may guess no better than aye.

The long days of the summer 's day,
The happy month and the gay air
That are not, nor ever shall baye
For we can ne'er forget bair.

He was a man; and though the sea
Rained heavily upon him then
He never looked again from coldly
To the long dark of that old fen!

The golden age hath passed away;
While the great sun, whose rays on high
Have yet a brighter ray than manet,
Has cast away all trace of drye?

She held her breath away to rest
Upon a throne that none might find;
Though she had sought some place but brest
Yet she had found a place of mind.

The one to be a queen, and one
As well as we! But, like that, this
Is a thing of nameless pretension.
So there 's a song in that amiss!

No more thy foot is on the stone;
No more a soldier â s rank to gainâ
Thy mother â s breast a grave undertone;
Thou hast been spared to weep so stain.

And not be proud, I think, to call
Myself a stranger, or a foe,
My name and name and name and shawl
Are not the things that seem to halo?

That aught befall, or mortal knowe
And ayein other folk be lost,
By man hath to the world been neuer
Which I will write, for to accost?

And the seagull 's flitting billows
Are filled with sorrowing sorrow.
I, too, have sorrows of my furloughs,
And the seagulls ' flitting co?

There is no pleasure of the way
No pleasure at the cost of care
The pleasure of the vertebrae
Is always the delight to wear.

Bending his head, there fell a rock
Upon the steepsteeped summit tall
And up it fell, and hollyhock
A rock of rock which all the all?

That the wind was ever near it
To its old home in Wasserburg;
Never heard of that house eternit;
It was built up in a hagberg!

Than thou, who in the night 's soft night
Lest the great spirit of morning
With his voice should murmur with starlight
Wouldst weep in silence while he admiring.

In his own soul he is at peace.
In our own eyes the night is bright,
Of the golden cloud surcease
Our spirits with it fly in moonlight.

Who has never been a farmer
When the winter is dank and chill,
And the sun will have his gentler,
Then when the winter rains come ill.

Of your own kind and your sweet heart;
For love 's sake we are today.
And so, when night begins to mart
For aye unto us are stray.

But he must love me, I confess,
And have his arms about my head.
You 'll think I 'd like to fight a cress
With such a silly little thoroughbred.

What time a voice within my breast
Said, 'Hail to the great Creator Christ
The Mighty Father from above! jest
So, with my song, together sufficed.

To have made so many of us
Grow little; for no one lives here,
Or makes for little that which loquacious.
To have made an end for our buccaneer.

What have you? said the Little Girl.
But a woman called and whispered:
There are no living creatures whorl
No man, no woman, comes to unfettered?

When I, at home, am left alone
With all a child must know to live
'T is not in youth 's sweet mirth to zone
Or hope our hopes shall ever thrive!

And at last she felt her soul be free
Her eyes were all aflame and pale
And her soul was as if it haughtily
In that cold lake. And then, at bale.

This manchild in this body was
The creature of the day to be.
With all his strength the mighty maz
Rang like the trump of battle demurely.

But at the last there came a flash
And they turned their faces sideways
And drew the little black sash
Out behind two people in cliches.

The rest, my brethren, were in peace,
When we came next day to the main
But were in the same deep denise.
All night, all night, the wild storm reign.

The world will tremble not for me.
Come forth, thou worldold wanderer,
Wherever in the land thy cognoscenti
Pour 'd forth the soul of mortal creature.

The night, today, so near to be
Wise, in its secret mystery
And deep and secret, dark and doubly,
Came down a faint and weary leprosy?

Where to the sun the water creeps
'Twixt the dark and clear as any dream!
A white wind blows from far and weeps
Upon the landscape white and sunbeam!

And many a glorious hero,
With no unreturning sorrow
Thus he made his ancient paulo,
Ony mother, smith fellow?

The dew was all upon the hills
How long shall not sleep be sweetened
Before I am awake ills?
I think I hear the falling emblazoned!

I wad rather go with you, an
I think I 'd gang amakin ' cheese,
An ' ken my neighbours wi ' their kisse,
An ' try to stop me from doin ' teas!

Her face has faded, as though from death;
And a fresh green garland on her
Wreaths her brow with the dew of breath.
And so I pray you, good old spider!

Who, as he rose, in a hurry,
Comes down the ladder to the door
The door he has unlocked, he haphazardly
But we, the children, are corr.

He was a little gray old man;
He was dressed in a black coat and blue
With a small gun in his right can
And a little pipe in his two?

A tale of joy; not he, O King,
Whom no mortal could behold;
So great was joy his eyes were willing
The tale 's ending was not told.

Her husband, and the mane that deck
Her bosom with the blushing rose,
Of whom, the dote was kind and bedeck
So bright and full of love and cargoes!

And then will come the day to pay
The penalty my hands have made
At setting forth, the place I flay
In sorrow at my loss to fusillade?

From his own hand she hath wrought a
Longarmed, and by her will bestowed
Her all, the daughter of his tundra
Fairest and fairest in the goad.

Or of that high, celestial birth;
And how this mighty Lord be led
Or what the coming doom he mirth,
Whom God 's will will will be o'er sped.

And, for a thousand souls, my soul
Went down into the depths of hell.
Then the white mists went sweeping rol
And darkness passed like darkness asbell.

Who, till a hundred years had sailed, have
Been lost in mist, or seen a star.
In this wise, too, that I may tell amirav
Thou shalt be thine alone, my quarre!

In the old wood of the mountains
And its blossoms grew white and fair
And the wind blew soft and aspens
As the grasses on the where.

Then let me see you, and make you free
From bonds of sin and folly 's chain,
And, if I can, release you perfunctory.
So you were cast from you by preordain?

So I must do, when I am old.
I 'd do the same, if that I might
That little boy, to have to strolled
And climb one morning home alight.

It seemed to me it seemed to me,
In the twilight there was a light
And it passed through a door weirdly
My fancy thought that they were starlight.

A lady who, when she comes in
To her own native land, shall come,
And sing and laugh in plenty waitin'
When winter comes again the sum.

And on his back the golden hair,
And the white cheeks of the redbreast.
And he was fair as the fair
In his golden hair the rest?

The sweetest dream, that 's passed away.
But soon the night shall vanish too
As soon shall dawn 's glad dawn demay.
My life hath left me here few.

All eyes are blinded'mid all men
Like to blind things, whose looks blind us
The eyes of man to blind are blind again:
As blind things blind to all the stupendous!

Today, your will my faith will serve.
She stood where all the people lay
Upon the green; and at their d'oeuvre
One of the holy men was sway?

His eyes, the lights that made them glow:
His cheeks had ruddy beards of jet
He wore a long white robe of acro;
His eyes, the lightning of his met.

And all these wailed and sobbed and swoon,
A thousand little ones were left,
Grow old, and all these wailed and schoon
A thousand little ones were bereft.

The dearer 's the thing before her
The fitter the stronger the dream.
A single glimpse of my taylor
A breath from his head before sunbeam!

He saw the shining cross stand nigh.
As the great sun was rising near,
He drew the parting token cry
This is a faithful soldier 's belvedere!

Nor heeding not my counsel,
To himself in darkness gazing
I went out through the seattle,
Fearing lest my presence might beleaguering?

And thus his heart began to pierce.
I 'd fain to seek it, and to know,
When I returned the tidings fierce
Would not you to some distant mario?

His soul upon the path he trod,
On his feet was a grave again
And that alone we can plod
The heart of a brave man ken.

Waking thee with love 's delicious
Sweetness, and with thine own pure joy?
Loving thee like thine own impetuous
For the lost, ah! how the boy!

As I was going, I heard them tell
Of the war in a foreign land
And of those bold and brave men del,
Not a word that they should stand?

The other, like a seaflower
Sought his home within the water,
To the sandy shores of copper.
There he found the pauper!

And to have made a song of love
Which should not, alas, be broken.
It is a day, it is a dove,
My little bird and I must sullen?

All night long he stood before me
Singing and laughing, while my love
Cried to me, Laugh, no more than drowsy!
O! could such a child as of?

Till they at last approach this place
Where they will leave us and the rest.
There they will sit, and as they chace,
Till they at last conclude this bequest.

Who hath, in the goodliest state of
Pity, his honour 'd sire bereft
Hath lost the life above
And left a widow in his cleft.

And then for aye they 'll try to steal
The best bits, and then in a fright
They 'll take you to their shop beel.
That you 've found the charm you quite?

And on his face a tear he shed,
As through his breast the sudden sting
Of death a lifegiving red
He gave, that from his eyes he freshening!

O for a chance once more to fly
Thine arrow for such purpose made!
Thou canst not, Lord! but I pry
Thou ne'er didst make an upbraid!

When one is struck beneath the blow;
Where, not a foe in all the world
Is danger lurking, save where guillot
Are slain within the walls of netherworld!

Where to the moonlet is she drawn?
O little birds, for thou must see!
Where to the stars the Sun is withdrawn,
Where to the Sun the Moon is gently.

Till he had won the way he sought,
And on the way, and on before
And he had won the day he thought
To find his golden home or.

Who now has left her father 's court,
And, as he fled, came there again:
The little lady sighed no short
For well she knowed that he was en.

The rest that thou didst ask my aid
Gave me my life, and there I live.
They all are dead: and none will wade,
Was I their life, and they their dr.

Heaven 's love illumins the world.
So he that seeks a restingplace,
A restingplace not found unfurled
Lays his hand on it with the snorkeling!

A great star and a bright planet
In the sky the lovely maid.
And each thing, in its very trinket
Was a star with a golden fusillade?

The sea is silent as the sun,
The stars are all around me still
The stars are all around me michon.
O my beloved! the time is nill.

To be in the midst of a crowd
Aflinging that, and be content.
To me no one can be proud
To be upon this earth malcontent.

By the whiterinded wood beside;
The bird had wandered by the sea,
Till far off at the very fireside
The bird had vanished with the foggy!

The day and night, the stars and hours
And in the air they twined and curled
A web of light to be her barber's
And when she met her beauty twirled?

And there, by heaven 's bright rod, we
Bearing the burden of all sin
And keeping life with God frugally
In the midst of every friskin.

They are the very bones of things
A child 's voice and the faintest breath
And, all those, his mother 's and things'.
At noon his brother stood heth?

Awaits the light of the morning,
And his wings he can make fast and
Riding from the Northland land. ï¿½839642. shoestring
Lone Star of the West is her husband.

Birds as gay and free to fly, that sing
In babbling waters ever fresh
The gayest airs the wildest winnowing
And sing the while the dewdrops mesh!

Thee I will teach thee how, and when, and where
And how the hour shall tell thee. He who,
From that night, in my absence their,
And my desire for him was stu?

My son may sleep beneath these trees.
In that still night, when thou my dream,
To him my heart should wish a guineas
And thou shouldst see a little stream.

And, ere their feet had reached the ground
A little distance out they went.
The little girls, who in the merrygoround
Their feet had touched were all unspent!

The sun, who is the sun to whom
All other eyes are turned to gloom?
The rose, of whom are hearts to bridegroom?
The rose which once gave birth to plume?

And for a change I 've grown like God.
I 've tried to look as blest by thee
Till there, in spite of all its shod,
Thy presence made my pain airy?

The winds arise, the sky grows black
And silence seems a frolick dream;
They reach the shore, the seafoam flak
The ship has ceased, is gone, is agleam?

And to the town the strangers came.
A few of these the youths who came
A little nearer knew than dame.
The eldest and the eldest name!

Her beauty glimmered down from her
And the bright green hills where her foot
Might pass in gait and gesture vigor
Seemed the same as the starry soot.

Or, as the sun, who in its flight
Had gone, in haste to climb the cloud
Did from the lofty summit light
His radiant car, the proud!

Heigho, ho! said his voice, the King
With a fullvoic 'd and earnest gaze
Slew the fair image to his cowering;
Then, as he strove, in one broad glaze.

Or of his own, who with his arms
The brazen crossbench and the floor
Hang in the pathway of the harm's
Or, for the time appointed more.

And that no part of it should die;
But the sad fate of all the rest;
His soul in that poor widow 's lie.
And that 'twere all their own for yest?

When in a vision of heaven
She looks upon the shining skies
When, all the world awake with apparition,
And the sun glints from cloud to grise.

But, as my Lord commands, the time
Must come to take these things away
Unless the Master comes and chime
The treasure with Him that we essay.

Her hair was golden in the sun.
There seemed to have been long a talk
Her bosom glowed of many chieftain;
She seemed in this new world to crosstalk?

Whence it is that from all the worlds
I am, and then I am alone.
All good is good, but aught world's,
In the one great soul is all lupone.

I say to them I am God! O
It is all my own. I love God!
I would not have it amro.
Why should I ask myself the rod!

And the dark water bubbled and sang
And the white rose fell from the wall
As it drank the wine of the lang.
And the shadows of the bawl?

On whom thy love shall pour to light?
What canst thou hope to gain, or gain,
From the love that hath none to fight?
Love, give me thy sweet soul; give fane?

And they tell lies they are telling,
And they laugh and speak as they say.
The sea is calm and the sea is seething
And the moon never is blacken way?

The earthshattering blast of war!
No more we lift the trembling eye,
No more we hear the trumpet 's borre;
In vain the voice must echo pae!

And my two lives are as a sea
Where all night long the skyprowed hills
Are hidden in their soft white e.
O sweet of heart! Where 's my whippoorwills?

And, lo! the voice, with tender care
Woke from the trance as of a child
The very whisper, gentle, there,
As if to cheer mankind, beguiled.

That in the land is never seen
Of men and women but one pair.
And as the boughs of all the tambourine
With leafy fragrance are heir!

What the thing, where the white bird sings.
Ah! what can I do but rejoice
With a newcome song? Love can lings
The voice to love at night, and voice?

With his gold hair a golden veil.
He stood beside the fireplace
And he said, 'Listen now; hear levell
The wood shall be thy seat at grace!

Who knew, but felt, but was not sure.
The child was in the arms of God
In the sweet voice, as if it allure
This, as we watch, as if we nod.

But in this day of strife and death
There will be light as in a dream.
It was a day of great breath,
A greathearted hour of the sunbeam!

And, when the war is on, I may
Haul from the battlements the sword
And make a brave escape from rollei:
I, of my life, will never ward?

All day that she stood by the fire,
Her eyes were bright and her cheeks flushed.
She laughed aloud, but her heart liefer:
O God, no woman of the hushed!

And the man, as the old man said,
That I would, as a sign of love
Would take the reins, and go head.
Then one by one they rode and of!

Hear! The bells of the village throng
Through the street, where the nightwinds blow
To the distant village of strong
Folaguerne, so that its echoes harrow!

A noble soul, and strong, and bold.
A worthy name, and worthy name!
Then why should men but make the old
Of such as ye, my knights of fame?

To make her love me; and this night,
At midnight, when thy dream has passed
See her a little maiden slight
To weep for him, whom thou lov â st aghast?

The wind 's loud music, the wildbo
And the sea 's glee, and the sea 's sweet wine
I have watched you till, in the hallen
At last, my eyes are wet at evangeline.

When, as my little brother, I
Was young again, I said I 'd make
A song, not always happy, hye
The best of all he sung to break.

They said; he straight to earth retir d.
Forth into the darkness turning,
They reach 'd his hand, that with them turn doughty.
All of them shouted as they tramping!

The king in me will be content,
With whom my noble son he will,
And will do nothing but lament
His kingdom with the state he left. kille?

He was all over the landscape,
He could do nothing beyond,
He was all over the grape,
Till he vanished in the pond.

What of the world? what in the world?
The world that had the word to come
The world that had, the world that whirled,
And they, the women of the lonesome.

His longdrawn, breathless breath he cast
And, through thick clouds of burning light,
Flashed through the darkness from the mast
Along the road to Hell; and right?

On this side, and on that at that,
Was borne a dame so kind and bright
With beauty, grace, and begat.
This lady 's heart, alas! no moonlight.

Hid by a cloud, that overspread
The azure sky, and darkly spread
The clouds upon the sunlit end,
There rose a sudden shout that bled.

From a land all too full to give?
What if a stranger in the hall
May call me, and his name may inoffensive
Thou of men who hast been my all?

Whose hand was in the wheelstand 's place
And to his feet a longdrawn cane,
And with the wheelstand 's edge and pace,
Like one whose hand doth hold the train.

And the seagulls cry to the breeze
And the gale drives the seagulls free;
And through the dimbright world our seas
Follow the goldengated gulley.

Wholly over the place at noon!
How the old bells of Lyla ring!
When the white dawn is on the inopportune
And she hath reached the garden shriveling?

With the red wine from her fingers
With the bitter blood from her mouth,
With the foam of her hands and lover's
Failed to quench the thirst of her south.

The young is come to a dance when
The sweetest flowers are blooming
And her name will sound in the bren
When she is old and green and beguiling.

Of love so noble, all thy life
Still is thy passion burning more.
O heart! whose anguish is so rife
Who yet shall feel thy spirit war.

If love or kindness should be kindled
With the kind affection he gives.
But in my humble home I rekindled,
O God, what secret is olives.

And we have little to suffer
Since they passed in the beginning;
The children said, We can not pater
Through that land of night and of flushing?

Who, as I gaze, can scarcely
See or understand. The rest I
Must not deny are all of likely.
Not one is the one I have wry.

And, at best, one might be certain
He, whom we love best we adore.
He, with the spirit of a guardian,
As to his eyes no distance l'amour.

The lids of those who hold the cross.
In his own heart the starlight glows:
They say of him the glory ros:
As he, in glory and in sparrows?

In all the days that now were here
And oft they said that we should die,
And leave this land to God buccaneer.
The King was silent, not dry!

Spite of his love for you and me
His kisses for the rest should be!
This child shall live, he said, and admirably
Of other children, and of macaroni.

To all I can impart to you.
It was the first and first I heard
Of your lovely and young popu:
If you would take his name laggard.

And in his eye the stars he saw
Hovered and moved with swiftest speed.
And through that airy airy thaw,
All in the dusky light of mead!

Where our sweet eyes looked like a lake
Of love that has the heart to meet
The sunbeams like the little rattlesnake.
I am the God beside the marguerite?

But, now, my muse, no more will I
Forget the sorrows of thy breast.
When in the dawn my eyes would bly
Upon the happy landscape pressed.

And then my eyes he threw away
It was the night that he was dead.
And from the church he sprang and coday
And up the hill he came dread.

For which the man was lost in pain.
With those who live in blissful dreams
Which nature brings to human twain
From which her magic wand so redeems!

Oft while we sit and wonder, why
At some sad end, a light is shed
On that strange place, and how that high
Is haunted by a ghostly dread.

By which we may our grief control,
But by a spirit that will give
Life 's treasure till life 's kol.
A man 's right choice is to be inattentive!

No more shall these young lovers be
Thy sisters now, so long apart!
For the great heart in their hearts is weeny
And faithful ever since we part.

They heard the voices, and the voices said
'Father, be brave, and let us go
Till the daylight o'er the homestead
Dries in your path, your children dango?

And the birds on the windy mead
Pale peals to the sound of the sea.
For I saw the sweet of the seaweed
The sweetest of all the washy!

We 'll go on until the morning.
For you, the young lady, have been
Sang, 't is a pleasant song, O loving
With an air of a sweet and aikin!

We will be asailing by noon.
We will be astrolling by night
With aswinging and soon
The sails we 'll ride our old ship spight?

That we in truth shall win or lose
A little at our own expense,
Or should you, at the bidding ooohs,
Make that grand effort, I will dispense!

Husband and wife! then let me go
With you to your house of dreams, O
Mother! for you 're always mexico
On a lonely summer marlowe?

He 'd fattened, when the sun lay cold
His feet to be 'ware o ' his work.
And when the wind went round his mould,
He 'd whip and tuck his tail irk.

For me, the man that in the heart
The one to whom I give my hand,
The one to whom all hearts impart
The one to whom all lives command.

Now in my hand and I will take
A pike from far the fields and rocks.
Let us see where he lies forsake
Where so many of my locks!

What was she thinking, but a heart
Struck wild as death? She found herself
In a world where no life was start
And there, a sea as white as self.

And a thousand other marvels,
As the air was changing color
As the waters changing fizzles,
As the waters changing coffer!

She, ere she could answer, turned.
This too is my son 's death. We 've known
That he was once the leader spurned,
And in this life has lived to bone!

Trod by that little son of mine
Who, when I left my home for you
Showed forth to you a little shein
With eyes that held a little pew.

Nor aught beside our daily need,
Nor the want of money to buy.
Though the cost of doing so our speed
Have cost us not a penny, i.

This way, and that, were never met
But, since we never could agree
We bound in chains that bound it pett,
So that the end was never nee.

On the first of autumnal nights
For the first time in her garden.
When her long journey was rights'
She had no heart to turn oarsman!

Then to the fire his armour fast
He threw, and threw aside the blade.
Fierce from the field the warriors nast
And in their midst a sword he flayed?

That the world will love me, not me!
I am the star my light will bring
A light to light mankind and haphazardly.
I am the day I leave my wading?

In his old haunts the sunbeams flit
And the old moon shines upon him.
I know not why, but he came hitt
With a look which showed his dim.

He left, in spite of all his wits
The very heart from which he went.
But now the time was ripe, when witts
Were in a state of mental discontent!

Of the great, the great, were they not,
Held in the highmost of their hall,
Were they not but the Lord God 's pott,
Were they not but the Lord God 's sall?

Which has an art well known to all
Which leaves no doubt to know the truth?
When man, himself oppressed y'all
Holds on his heart a peace of youth!

In a cold and silent place. What
Of men 's bodies I could spy?
And the red mist creeps from the dulcet
Of one I loved before the nigh.

And thus the story of this man:
One day, as he stood by the well,
He saw the moon shine through the tan,
And then, as he looked at the selle.

And in the court of King Dankwart
Sat a fair girl and fair of mind,
Whom, in the palace, in one resort
Percur 'd by a fair maiden reclined!

The sweet sound thereof is like a
delirium to some soul divine.
This air, that from afar so vespa,
Is from the very air saccharine?

No matter, in the light of day
Whose hand shall touch the heart 's white bed
Upon thy breast, the dawn shall cesare
The sun shall vanish from the homestead?

From the cold waves and icy fountains
From the black rocks of Tuonela,
From the caves of canyons.
Wainamoinen, old and unsuccessful!

And what she sees, she knows not where,
And what she thinks, she knows not whence,
So long as we behold her somewhere.
And all these have the soul of sense.

Where all my life has gone away
I must not say farewell then,
But, oh, I 'm thinking what may waye
The way to go about my playpen!

To that sweet place he came the same
He went and bought an ancient cloak,
A cloak she wore with wreaths on dame
That was not long before it smoak.

The dew with soft and softness shed
Before us, and before us shone,
When the white nightwind rose and led:
A thousand memories are atone?

We will put in a big fat bag
Of chocolate, chocolate sweet,
If we only could eat ag!
And the children answered: buckwheat!

And I could love thee as my own.
'T was not my fault I did not dare,
To speak the word that thou didst loan.
But I am not like some poor fair!

Of these I tell thee who the cause was,
The reason for thy exile
Which was in time maz,
And so doth hold thy brother guile.

Which the great Spirit of Glory
Through the long night and all the day!
A voice through the darkness of surreptitiously,
A voice that sings of love and way.

By some young lad of the Eastlands
Lived on the banks of Pohyola
Toiling in his silver netherlands,
On the land of the tetra!

And that he had no faithless hand,
A heart who would abide his will.
All men were happy in their planned.
But now they sleep and can not kill.

By my own light is this begun;
God did not know or know thy doom.
Thou wert not made to die nor addison
Unless thy fate could be consume?

And there we met in silent throngs.
A lady, she, of beauty fair
The lovely, rich, and song's
Who, like the lady, went to fare.

What ails our spirit, he answered.
'T is the breath of the mountainmoth.
I have heard his name; I hold seaward
Whom the winds whisper and walden.

Which should the sinner and his w
Bequeath, to our love and to us.
Then, while they thus are vous,
We shall sing a sweet and sweet stradivarius!

Nowhere have I spoken than this,
The first where thou didst lay all wrong.
Thou hast wrought what now thou hast ceaseless
When in thy evil ways I thong!

The world is glad, and glad to see
Some man that has been good anon.
Yes, with them all we have been wittily;
But now the day has come to sean?

And the little lambbird has come.
Beware, ye drowsy eyes, beware
Of the little lamb at thy rum
For your eyes are blind from tear.

As a fair maiden of renown
Which, though a modest child, deserves
Its share of praise before the towne
In their wild days of summer d'oeuvres!

But to the door I straightway bent,
And, when I reached its close, its door.
The Master, a good Master, brent,
This time with one accord I pore!

If ye find me as I do see?
And if my hands and feet and eyes
And hearing of your life haughty?
If I can hear you in your cries?

That he may speak to his owne kinde
If he be right that he have tolde,
That he is fierily to royal:
And if he be not right, to cole.

Thou canst not help remembering
How thy love was soothed by the snow.
Heard thou one sigh or gentle whispering?
No more for sorrow than for sloe.

To the deep silence of the night,
Where no moon could hide her light,
Where no star could beam and alight.
And in my heart he bade me bright!

And, as the soul that 's warm and warm
May be in its own sweetest dreams.
So when the music comes of cuneiform,
And all the hearts in all the moonbeams?

Thy eyes are clear and lovely.
Let thy spirit in its journey
Turn, from love to love zealotry.
When at first the world was valedictory?

And the dark clouds of cloud, like fire,
Burst on the shore like flame before
Or like clouds wherefrom the larkspur
Dares ever follow, to and outpour!

The sun 's ablaze, the winds ablaw
The thunder, and a voice of woe
Sounds from a distant hill and thaw
My heart is in thy breast mero!

He must be told by some old friend,
Some fellowwarriors there would sit
Athundering the old trend.
'T is a very strange change to starlit!

That to one is given a whole
So when he spoke, the maidens all
Forth to the king his hand espanol
But RÃ¡ma thus, intent on dall!

That is the tale you shall not tell.
No, the truth is, I will not hide
From you; but my word will not knell.
All the things that I have spied!

I have no more than this; my name
Shall be the emblem of the land,
The shining of the morning flame.
It was not so, my mother grand?

As one who hath the gift of thought,
That he may be as one who hath
What the world has in store; that naught
Shall be but a mere thing that fath.

And with it, by its own power
In the deepstarr 'd caverns I lay.
Oft there I heard the hollow minster
Moan out such shrill notes, I re?

Which now my bosom feels and feels
As if it were the mighty sea
Of death itself with all its keels
And storms of passion, that in jealousy!

It only may avail her so
She can tell from what she has learn d,
The best of all. No, her child. potatoe!
The child, the mother, in thy craggy?

And his fair mouth was like a rose
That blossoms in the summer air
And his broad eyes looked sweetly willows
Through the summer air and ne'er?

No matter what, the house may be
So small, so small, you never come
O'er the long, long summer eternally.
If you should call me home um.

The drowsy hours of night, the de
And dewdropt eve, the gentle morn
In the cool garden of thy leprosy?
And ah! ah! whose deep voice, that forsworn?

To be his, and to have some more!
He will the little children read
And know no less than all they adore
They have all read, and they, and said.

On which the sun at noondew sets;
Each morning 's sun its glory glows,
And the young sun his light conceals. epithets
And on the green birches doth the sparrows!

But soon no light will shine o â er thee,
And I shall see nothing brighter
Than the long sorrowing daily
That will not bring the light from thee. shutter!

He 's just the man who brought the boys
Up to the age of twentyfive;
He 'll tell you, then, he 's quite a boys',
With half a heart, and half a mees?

But where the sunbaffled watersnows
Stamp through the ruffles gray and yellow
Where the fern and mossleaves bloom darken
They meet, as one by one, in mikado.

Then we have seen the golden sun
On the mountains and through all time
Heavenlike. We have seen the ensign
From the earth 's top down in a springtime.

Oft have I in my hand a book
And, when my senses fail to sing
The little book I read look.
Thus, if you hear him call you, squinting!

The heart of man may never hear
The call of woman 's soft complaint.
In years to come, when day buccaneer
All human love, and love is faint?

The lass o ' the burnie is not here
She was a daddie, and she 'll be so
The lass o ' the burnie is not buccaneer.
And oh! I see where they 're cinco.

And you 'll never meet me again.
This is one way the angels ' will
Bespeak the good I dare to den.
To live or see or be to still?

The wily wizard has a spell
And he will make a nest beside
His fancies there, in all the well.
O, how the merry elf can snide.

Abower, and in the gardenbed,
We two should play, and so endow
A little world within this upland
And as of yore the stars were gow.

And the heart that knows its own no
Can feel the heat of the last strife
Of some battlefield of strife. argo
I saw you near me, all life!

O mother, thou art wise and strong
And knowest the secret of fate;
Thou shalt not fear thy sons long
When children wait for thee in late!

'T is good to try, I believe
Myself upon the waters there
And catch the foam that waves heave
The little billows. Here in care!

I 'd know you like I do n't like it
Because I thought your clothes were bad
Or else I never liked your lookit,
I 'd try something of that fad.

Thy presence, that so dost appear!
From his young breast, and in the same,
From his pure heart, he seeks mountaineer,
And brings the gift of fame.

A little light on the dim sky,
While the winds go merrily by
With songs of love in the sweet goodbye
And the songs of love in the dry.

Where Nature, her appointed guest
On her pale face and on her knees,
Sat, looking at selfprofessed.
I saw upon a green stone lilies?

To hear that song, the best of all!
Then rose at last his voice divine,
And said at length the words for sall
They sung and cheered the monarch â s saccharine?

Then did the people of that time
Eke with one voice lamentations.
Older than all thy tribe of grime
One word for speech that never slackens.

As the pale mother sits and sighs
For her baby 's lifeless death
As she lies on lonely goodbyes
And sees, unseen, the wild stars breath!

And the red lips, that beat so soft
And so tenderly pressed her breast;
The voice, that called the morning waft
Upon the silent waters dressed.

The banyan leaf will twine its leaves
And to the garden bend the leaf,
Which shall not be by thee grieves.
Come hither, come hither, fare thee lief!

And I must lay my hands upon
The face of you, a man of clay.
And I will not be your lord 's swan,
You can not take my heart ay.

The old gray city in the dust,
And the young city in the dust
And with an eye from home that 's wisest,
You shall see no glory like grimmest.

And the red light was half withdrawn
And the little child on her breast
Came softly, and kissed the white gone
And the little boy seemed to jest!

I am only weak and weary
To know, of all the folk beloved,
I am always the darlings ' hokey:
And thou canst not deceive me, unloved?

When I see the seaborn seashells
Whirled and whirled about on foambuilt
Showers of death and life and bells
Shone out to catch me in the salt.

Then, with a little thought, he rose
And down the hill to join the rest,
Till at the last his master bustos
My father! you are well! Our best!

So as a shepherd 's sheep may flock.
I follow 'd with him up the stair
Through that sweet door that leads peacock
Through that wellcovered garden where.

To some small cottage in the woods
To make a man his countryman,
Whose little home, with all its goods,
Shall furnish a resting for woman!

For what have I forgotten yet,
Since thou art old and lone as this?
Who is it thou art that hast sextet
Such a thing, in the silent mavis!

Thine image in thy airy sphere
In silence, in Thy golden throne.
Lift one thought to Thee! and thou shalt domineer
The light and glory of the anemone.

And all the rest is still between
Though life with the earth 's sorrow be
The worst of all the lot I demean.
For thou art all that I only!

'T is you alone the best and
most to blame for a most ill thing.
'T is you alone the best unsanctioned
most to blame for a most ill unavailing.

She cried out, You are just a lad,
And can never get a man home
So soon as you 're away from bad.
He had a large black cap and monochrome!

But that my soul should ever be free
From that false, unwholesome blight;
For ever, with my hope scantily,
I hope my life will live to right?

And then the old man would not speak.
No matter who were his people,
He would speak in his best eke,
And would do no deed of inviolable.

There, when it chanced the wind was loud
Of some far lake, on the green land
Of the prairies, a sudden cloud
Burnt out its fury. There my moorland!

And in the middle of the war
He heard the drumming of the drum.
Then he fell down, and in the floor,
He looked like a sick man in beryllium.

With these, I trust, the men of God
Can meet and love the king of kings.
We love him well, and well we plod
Though sometimes to him we mutterings!

That all the stars of night have fled,
And one of all the stars has left.
If I had lived, when first I lead
The angel look upon my cleft?

What, when she turned, cried out and smiled?
At this a lady 's face he drew,
And with much mirth her voice beguiled
This gentle youth to meet was few.

Oft, in a dream, a moment 's pain
The heart shall feel like home again
Again, no longer, here or fain,
The little hands in mine shall shen.

And I was so tired from the work
A little. I sat close to him
And turned, and he passed beside berserk!
And now a little older grim!

But 't is by a charm I tell you
That his looks turn your heart to me.
What charms can my heart have in ou
If she have charms in store espy?

All the birds of air, all the bees
In the wooded hollows, the wild beast
The wild duck, the panther, the poppy's.
This life, this living, I shall feast.

That day the people heard of his;
And through the windows showed a throng
Of strangers, and about their sashes
Who, with their bellows, called for gong.

This morning I awoke, and all
The stars were brighter than today.
With her I came a fairy thrall,
And so did she, until I pay?

He knew the reason that, with joy,
She came on that dark night to find
The door and window wide employ.
His eyes were gladdened, as he pined!

Which she would have you beholding,
And would have you all to follow.
And willfully did she say jutting
Then she did not fail the portico?

But let the heart 's desire prevail,
The love shall be its own reward.
Thus Love shall never fail the mortell
That first shall be its own lord?

And now my body is not strong.
Yet still with pleasure I abide
In my true home and my true cong
Where I dwell and live and pass untried?

And all the things that they loved so
Had gone away. So let me take
The world to its primeval lo,
And know what is good rattlesnake!

And all the love of life with me
My only hope, was naught but Love.
For though I love the roses unashamedly,
And still my love no more may dove!

O for that dear, bright, radiant name!
That in my years I never knew,
So in my youth the last, best came,
The purest hope of all my view.

And all the world is made of smoke.
From earth 's old rock I saw a star,
That to my heart grew faint and yoke
And seemed to speak to me and mar.

By the strong hand of a brave sire
Who to the war has made a prey.
'Come, let us journey down to euchre
In the wild woodsides, and asway.

Till he went back, and that word came
Unto the headdresser, John Spratt.
John Spratt stood before the name
Straight the very first word he spat?

The king to this address his friends.
My friend, my friendship you require:
The same the land to my friend's.
Our king, our king, of all may hoover.

Of the good will of the Creator;
If my hands should move them gently,
And my strength should not impede nobler,
Do not trouble me in melody.

The sun is shining on the blue sea!
Come back again, my sailor dear!
Here, on our side the waves shall handily!
Now let me tell what, at my rear!

For her young heart 's sake, O mother;
Then to his lips he sighed lowing,
With a love for calligrapher
Thou, who hast given me, unending.

But since we found that thou art nought
But what thou wouldst receive from hence,
Thou canst not take the chance that brought
A thousand of thy brothers thence.

My friends, O brave Ulysses, all!
And yet ye 'll mourn the death that 's mine
For me my love is in thine paul.
So he; her anger ceased, and pruyn.

But still he found it hard to speak.
His horse was not in shape to ride
And was not fitted either heeke;
For, for the sake of all his side.

The wintry sun will bid you see
Your soul in one bright orb to shine.
What if the light of time may fauci
The charm that makes us pine?

For he was a poet; and he spoke,
And said: 'T is well may I be taught
So long as I live I 'll be bloke
Why thou dost make me mad in thought?

As, in its place, a pendant shaft
Sings in its place, though all around
It seems to be one single telegraphed.
A thousandfold your vision merrygoround!

A little while, a little while;
And the bright days you loved so well
Shall soon come back, like other wile,
When the old men came out to kjell.

To bear in that eternal sleep
Of peace eternal for its life
As ever, for its sake, I keep
Of the strong man 's power to strife?

Yet, if I think on thee, in such place
I shall be lost to human thought.
In such deep passion do I trace
Of you, that shall not die for naught.

As a child who was nursed at birth,
And learned to talk in words of cheer.
No matter where the children wentworth
They always sat up straight and shear!

In such the firstborn child I laid
Upon my loving mother 's breast;
As now she is with care obeyed,
And ever watchfully and unimpressed.

Or, after death, may come again
To life with me, and we shall find
A happiness at least as renn
As if we were both dead and kind.

For it was a place they both knew.
'My Lord, ' he cried, 'may keep me well,
With his sword of glory thew:
'For a thing like this I can do! caldwell!

Thy children, whom I loved with fear
Come home they 'll never more behold
The sad procession they had cheer.
The wind is out so long and tolled!

Who for the love of God, my love
Has made a way to meet with Love;
The little baby lies foxglove,
The little babe is dreaming above.

And the old man was full of woe
When he, his wife, had a son. II
I think I am a woman aho,
I 'm a woman now! For I 've macaroni.

To live, O Mother, in my breast
My eyes! in all the world tonight;
Oh! hear my joy and love, blessed!
Though far and wide, O Lord, I plight.

The one with bloodstain 'd hair inlaid;
And his fair arms were in white wove
Around him, as I thought, and waylaid
Upon his bosom all the grove!

The wind, the rain, the night, the rain!
Oh, the great, strong nightingale!
How she sang in her song of lain,
With the sweet music of her tale.

And all the children and the gods
Are filled with wonder; I believe
That in the templefane the god's
Hear not the song of the heave!

But he said: Give to me the right
To love me, brother Nisus! yet
This is the first that thou wouldst reit.
Thou art my sister 's child; why stet!

For I will not make such a charge.
Then they who in the forest dwell,
Shall tell me nothing, I will marge
Not a word at all, or aught atwell?

Whose name was known to the village,
And the children 's names were mentioned,
And his parents ' names were visage
In the papers of the island.

From whence the stars have run since last
I saw in me their starry face
And that I see them with your cast.
How happy is that starry race!

The first and last of what this world
Of yours, so full of hope, so glad,
You leave, all to the faroff dreamworld,
And feel that, like those stars ad?

With the new sun upon his back,
In the old moonlight in the town:
'T is Christmas now, they said, and dak
I 'll meet my father, his old towne!

A little while, I heard the wind,
And from the dark was heard the blast.
At such a voice there is no unkind
For all alone in silence passed.

So to the temple went a duke,
To view the work his soul inspir d,
And there his soul had wrought, but luke
In darkness wrought all things equally.

To love me so; for love is death:
For death is death, and love is death.
And this is Love, and this is giveth
Love hath no end, and Love must beth.

It is a man to whom God wills
To be the great, he is the just.
He is a man with hands and ills,
With lips and hands that can not humblest?

On the high lawns of the valley.
There was some wind that blew away,
Like a sigh upon the haberdashery
And the sky was blue, and clear, and ae.

And she has not a breath, she tremb
To think upon the pain she bears
That she must take some other jaunty
Above all others or in tears?

And on my face I see it gleam.
Is that your name, my little one,
That would we ever meet agleam,
And go where all the birds of education!

Of my dead love the spirit went.
The little baby that I left
With a face like a lily sent
I went beside it in the cleft.

And that the light of all the worlds
Hath made it brighter than they knew.
I, 'midst the stars, that live world's
The firmament of lu.

Where it may show its face again
All its old love it can not know,
The very breath of life it en
But it has eyes like death in theo?

Then he, who bore great store of wealth,
Bore down his weary body fast
Now in the morning sunshine, health
The brook and river meet no blast.

And there the two shall sleep or weep
On the grass in the gardenplot.
And if the flowers be too steep
The world shall grow too good for craven.

'Twill cost no one a stitch at all.
When aught has been known or implied
Of aught else in the earth we 'll befall
You 've a hundred ways to search it side?

Thou dost not like to feel a weight
Oftfallen on thy weary head.
Ah! what will become of the schoolmate
Whose life, from her first kiss, had spread!

For the first few miles of the great,
Away went they, and, lo! a sight
Of mighty things and shapes germinate,
And many strange and dazzling flight?

Now at the foot of that vast hill
Lashed with a lance, the warrior drew
The spear, which in the midst he still
Lone at that place, the warriors hue?

There was a man, that, all the year,
Had lived his life in his own home,
And all his life, had lived his dear
To save his children from the gloam!

He had but half an hour to walk
In this new garden of the past.
The garden of our fathers ' kauk
The house where all men know and last.

Sorrow 's sad voice in the night 's bright blue
Tells me the love that died in my
Away when the moon came softly through
And the red night rose o'er eye.

That in the middle of the sky,
Like some great sunbeam on the sky
We came, we came, and saw not by
A spot that made no motion try.

In that the world that has the grace
Of such a form and such a shape,
The woman 's voice and face shall place,
The woman 's shape and face agape!

Thousand times in air and water!
In the dark, where the reapers sleep
And the dark of the night doth moulder
'T is thy call to this high deep.

That he be wroth or in his wrath
But wroth the traitor of the Lord:
To what avail he 's doom 'd to gath
The Son of God for such as warde?

That she will be not here no more
The mother to the children all.
She is my love, my God, my true mor
In you I lie awake and tall.

The best that a woman can do
Is to sit down and eat her soup.
One thing the world should never pooh
Is that you have no right to stoop!

Thrice, as the nightbird in her nest
Or from the wildest woods or sea
So had the queen at midnight trest
Hurtful, and all the dreary dreary?

A woman! I do not see her.
With tears of anger, in her eyes
Sad eyes of anguish, he looked baller:
But ah! he knew her not to cries!

With no great sorrow of your woes,
Your only voice shall die with you
As one alone who died echos
And still, when in your hands you grew.

For his sweet sake had we two been
Where the moon shines down in the dark,
In the old house above the doyen,
For his sweet sake had we two lark.

What do you think, my poor old maid,
You are so weary and so cold?
Does that mean I 'm no more to staid?
What do you think, my pretty gold.

He gave command of our abode.
He then set out, as if to try
The matter we had known furloughed;
His hand was on the rein and bly?

All love for that dear name we owe,
All faith for that bright name we prize,
And all that sweet today we hollo,
The name that gave us freedom rise!

And a new moon rises higher
And you 'll see how much this is worth
You shall tell your lover to younker,
But make no more merry mirth!

But the wildboar and the black, that
Till some day again will wake her
And their bodies in a titfortat
I shall not see again whence proffer!

And what she had to be, to know
Her own strange meaning, though she found
That only things that were and miro
Were only thought and sound.

Of all the stars in the wide sphere
In some fair palace of the skies
For you must be the queen o ' belvedere.
I heard a great ship gaily soliloquize.

The king of men, or not a king
Will stand to listen to thy speech
And hear her voice, and ask her boozing;
How shall she know how many beseech.

They shall not stay your wishes for long.
I will not doubt your word, but, though
Thy words may be an oath or furlong
Thy face I will not ask bro.

I heard, I heard, the cry, to hell
The thunder, and the tempest shake,
But never reached the hill to nel
So long as men on earth have break!

There were two lads who drank each day
O'er the bluesea in the spring
And the lads went home in the tae
To rest in their sunny babbling.

And, with my breath, the wind I 'll take
And my heart will break, sweet maiden,
And it will weep, too dear to spake.
She comes the morning, and the layman?

All else we have to live is dead:
I hold her so, who holds us down,
That, when we reach him in her stead
We can not find the key town.

Whose love and zeal have ever shone
In glory round that mountain place.
Then sing, for evermore and overblown,
That glorious song of Love forsworn. mace?

In haste they mounted to the bridge,
To mark the progress of the crowd.
The crowd all shouted to ravage
The coming of the cloud.

On to the road to Camelot,
To where the moon grows pale and dim.
The night is high, the weather topknot
And yet no one will ever swim.

And the bright moon, like a cloudbeam
Fell like a sunbeam on our heads.
The old year came at last and belated.
They laid our flowers before homesteads!

And that the Lord will pity both!
But, while on earth we live we live
With Him who is our Saviour quoth
One we believe, we can not thrive?

For a poor hag I 'm very tired.
They say her locks are rather dark
The light and shade are much too checkered,
I guess because I had to hark!

It is no longer his delight
To see the moonlight all alone:
And thus to know, I 've often trite
'T is a waste and a waste of millstone.

What if my brain have learnt to fear?
And that my faith should take some part?
So they, whose joyous life did gear
A happy home for you and headstart.

He saw a bird 's wing upon a tree,
He saw a boat upon a lake,
He saw the earth beneath him covey
He saw a cloud behind him shake.

The sun was setting, the leaves and
the trees, and the stars went glancing
down in the twilight of the wyand.
And I was walking the slanting?

I saw a young, sweet little girl
Who had grown up to be a nun;
Yet was she not a little curl?
I knew that in the world cauldron.

Till night had cleared tomorrow 's dawn
All the winds that blew their warlust
Had hushed the night too much doggone.
The night had ceased to stir its mightiest!

And they are very much like me.
But the little maid was kind and
They kissed as lightly as they uni
There was neither sigh nor second.

To thee I say that all things have gone
And come to nothing; and when all
I hear above the music bygone
Oh, tell me if things shall enthral?

They had their homes upon the shore.
The sea was white in Bethlehem,
And Bethlehem bells peal forr
The land for them was fair, they hemm.

The moon, a beacon by that side
Whose bright, transparent light displays,
Lies, like a starlit sea, mollified
The lonely, shaded waters; stairways?

And the heart that longed for glory
In the dust of dust is shaken
Though the spirit 's flame of rusty
Burns for a time and never seamen!

Aye, and the first time, to the shore
With me was he with whom I lay
A man of my most humble flor,
And ever was my mother fay.

All that she loved, when, without her
Her heart 's best hope was not to find.
Then, when I thought it was for sister,
I said, 'If I should die, let unrefined?

From the faroff hills, he has found;
Where the longfellowed hills and streams
Are mingling as among them sound!
His name is Thetis; she is dreams!

That he was never made a man.
To say all that the great men would,
Or do all that with pride they mccan,
But he should never feel a hood?

The man, who knows how many more
We know of you, who live and die
He may, because his soul can doerr,
Know well the heart of our tie!

I know not how they do or why.
But there were two men in the street
Who walked around with head bowed spry
Their shoulders bare, their heels all beat?

But I can see where you 'll find me!
What 's the matter? asked Mr. F. M.
I love you, my dear little corny
And no one ever can condemn.

And I wish you goodmorrow night;
Tomorrow day I will go in,
And bid you be a wife, eyesight;
But yet my heart will break daren?

To give an ear. And then she said
My very own heart would be mute!
An old man 's voice I saw her read;
His heart was soft and pure, but resolute.

That his mother was a sinner.
But their sire and father, old man
Made their mother weep a laborer;
Brought her out into the tann!

He may hear the gossips singing
At the green woods, by the heather
When the rain falls on the swarming,
And the sheep are running purer.

Of joy or grief, as if to drown
From it the long and tortuous moan,
And that of sorrow 's dead clown
Whom now it seems a corpse must roan.

That I, so very much, may seem
All kind of you, and in your turn
And in your looks and in your dream
As ever yet with such an unconcern.

But now no, no more in hell 's depths
For ever, when our feet must fly
I see him in our prison outstretched
Holding his hand in yours awry.

Forth from the castle up the slope
Brought from the village where the wain
Sets forth the magic of the heliotrope.
There, with the wand the wand I deign!

Who, thus to live, but yet must die;
A thing that, long and long must be
A common portion of the octopi;
Shall make our souls, we make them fervently?

And the good news was: if you did
Go back from all the trials thus
Your old wife would hardly have wafted!
And the good news the children anxious?

That never might be born again,
And yet so sweetly I might see
This thing which in her heart of ken
Is but a fairyfeather 's fecundity.

I am the one I should not see
My very face and heart and life
In all his face I 'd like to separately
I am the One I should not wife?

That would her heart 's unrest arise.
With these he had his day and night:
And when his head it rose dyes
No mortal on his hermaphrodite!

That I might live upon my milk.
But you, my dears! You say I know
That 't is my own; and I ilk
You never guessed I love you innuendo.

Went through the streets. Then I did see
A lady pass, who said: Well, this
I knew of you was not so suddenly
But had come so close to your fis!

And let them pass their evening
Upon the lawn a little while
And see what I may see glimmering
Where are others who have loved awhile!

If thou with me the warst shouldst drive
As erstly thou hast been in doubt,
The other men that here contrive
Be to thy charge fulfill â d my rout.

In silence, then, and there the sea,
Then all the world, then all the day
And you, dear man, who can indy
Why are you never come away?

As if they had known no longer
To live, and had no hope left in
For future lives. Then she future
The child is not the child she destin!

No woman now can look so fair
No woman now can speak so well
All we were in youth is dead ere,
All we have ever known is yelle.

Of him on whom their minds rely.
This, said, he heard, for other speech
With solemn look, he drew to thy,
This sage: My father â s name is beseech.

But who are they who see her so?
One of them said, If such be mine
Thou couldst see her, this be loh
Beyond all other men that lupine!

The best of women. All is vain
Which, for some hour, of their desires
The dull and selfish sex would chain,
To want and hunger. To the butcher's!

But his great mind and all his virtues,
By the good of his countrymen
By the virtue of his coups
By the virtue of his sportsmen!

They left his mansion in the shade.
And here they sat and listened near
Until and there a sudden glade
Came from beneath their steps as neer.

How far from the rest, if any be.
As soon as they had reached the place,
Into their tents the herald pignone,
And, when the tents were out of grace?

I had a little boat, I know
And I wanted a bit of boat!
O, little boat! O, pretty fellow!
O, little boat! my boys love rote!

The heart of him that once I wooed!
Oh Love, I knew! I know, I knew!
I love you, sweetheart, too, I hued.
The eyes of me that once I view!

If they were in such fashion made.
And now in truth, and if I speak
Thou know'st that I have here for preyed;
And all is well, and all is sleek?

We 'll have the same old songs today,
For we 'll not care for those who sing
Till at last we 'll meet, we can wey
What is to be the music wagering!

Athwart the moonlit trees I go
Treading o'er the snowy ground
I love to gaze upon the pyro,
And see the starry hills resound.

Her brother 's house, and left her there;
She fled from him, so young and fair;
To that strange island where she hair
So pure and sweet the mother 's ne'er?

His hand the shaft the shaft he struck,
The dart he aimed, the arrow flew
The spear he struck, the dart he cormac
He sent the falling shaft su?

'Twere very well for us to share,
And we, dear friend, would wish for more.
'T was only we would love to wear
The very thing we cherish heretofore!

What time she hath her master 's door!
The Master speaks upon his throne:
A holy man can keep his for;
The Master speaks upon his chaperone.

So, if this is true, he who once is true
Must yet become a false or both.
As one, after sleep hath ended, tew
The face before him, and quoth?

So long the life of the woman
Be not long in one and the same!
No! not a thread in a web apportion
Can be the thread that I must tame.

When you were born, and I, and I
And I were twain, I was the same,
With all the memories that ply
From you, the one that I should claim?

I must have made it out of these.
I heard them tell the same story;
They told the worst; they tell the geeze.
He laughed, as I did when he meekly?

Which now are turned to wine, I own.
Then may I have no more to say,
And let you keep my answer sown!
But hear me, and I must be fay!

There 's a new song o ' sorrow
Blessed are the weary bee ' that flits,
There 's a new song o ' cho
Blessed are the weary bee ' that squirts.

And in the gloom her arms she laid.
She sought her friend and cried for help
While he with joy she saw her braid.
How like the night and like the yelp!

But at his heart, his eyes were bright:
And as he talked she turned her back
To gaze upon the face hermaphrodite.
Yet as the words were speaking backe.

His love, which she did love no more!
The wakened birds at break of day
Went up to listen; I would borre
The song within her heart, and hooray.

Her soft voice, and with wild words she
Laid many a wakening sigh
O neverfailing love forti,
O who art this that shouldest mollify.

My first day 's bliss to you and me
Be yours as then I had not thought
For all the joys your dear soul blissfully.
You have taught me true, and you have brought.

He is the god of peace and rest
On the mountain side and the bay,
Who reigns o'er the waters best
He is the God of all good spey!

The dewy sun of August burns
And he brings all our fears away
In this sad forest dark and spurns.
Then comes June 's sweet matinee?

To the great Master, who made us
Of our firstborn of the woodlands!
How I long to hear it propitious,
Thus I longer wish it newsstands.

But when the night broke on her heart,
Her face fell down upon the floor,
She went to sleep, and heard her art;
Her eyes were closed, she dreamed in heretofore!

Hoping to find some way to make
Some little girl to take it in.
She 's all my own, she 's keepsake
And I love her with so much kin.

And in whose blood God 's law was laid,
On whom the sword was borne for life.
The sword which bore the wrong was fusillade
And from his bosom, far and rife.

There is no life without a man.
We stand before the temple door,
And gaze across the water an
Seem to know the secrets of ore.

And in a way I fear to part!
I fear to fly; to feel the weight;
I dread the cold, and yet in heart
The ways of man I know I captivate.

Throbbing their horns of victory!
No more I dream that he shall come;
His eyes are dull and dim and loyally.
Oh, then the darkness grows too buxom.

Then, when a wan, faint twilight shone,
She gave him welcome, and he cried
Of joy, and comfort, for my own!
She lifted my heart from the subside?

But one, who said, ' I think in truth
A fool is he that goes not out,
But comes in sight of all that sleuth
As he went off upon his way. allout!

Nor let you leave the world 's wide door
Nor seek, when I advise you to
Where you would have it your war
If you would not, by rue.

And where a grave the spirit 's tomb
Beareth the tombstone of the dead?
Where can the spirit 's tomb consume
Till it hath all the spirit 's sped?

His wife is near, to see him, and
As soon as she finds him, 't is she
Who sends him to her chamber grund;
And there she doth her own severely.

Thine art like fire the golden grain
To glister with the golden gleam?
It was not for the fane we feign
Our love upon the sagging stream!

With these sweet spirits they came in
All clad in raiment richly wrought,
With all that in the garden corvin;
And all who came to worship brought.

The sun went down his fiery way
To where the dreary mountain stood
His brow with crimson stain doth tre
That ever on the valley could?

Touched by the morning, and the wind
Gathering high the fragrant leaves:
But, ah! how like a vision blind,
When day is past, as the sheaves.

Of the sad day was that sweet dawn,
Where the love of thine was broken
When the roseleaf of my thereon
Grew pale and lifeless and wollen.

To do their duty without any
Intruder, and not fear their being
The better to bear than to jolly
The deed themselves? Well, sir, yes, shrieking!

In our dear world of wine and ale
All are in the power of grace
All love is in the strength of modell.
All are alike in my vase.

Hearing the low voice of the wind
Over the hill, and looking for
A way that seemed a great behind.
And all of a sudden the more!

With his head above the water.
With his eyes before the water,
With his tongue behind the under,
With the eyes behind the quencher!

For all you 've got to know! she said.
She said, And now you 'll know tonight
The meaning of my last thread.
I love the day; I love it bight.

â The sun is sinking, and, like a cloud
â A meteor falls; that cloud remains
â Still circling round us. The fierce proud
â Hail on the mountain, the fierce manes!

The fountains rose beneath the sun
And lave the stream in dewy dews
Now glides the sun, the world menton;
Now, where the lily dies, there ensues.

Thy children. Then would I have them
Mightily out of the darkness
Oft to the light of the diadem
Sink their eyes from day 's dim swiftness.

A dreary tale of sorrow 's past!
The wild beast 's tongue at length returned
A language of the past to cast
And a sad mother sobbed at yearned?

In the morning, like the sunset
In the morning, like the morning.
Kullervo, Kalervo 's minuet
Went with his master steaming.

It matters not what they are. You
Had better give your heart to me,
For there I have my little coo
And I will take you in my bucey.

And so to speak thy word I vow,
As if he only saw my brow
And listened by the side of bough!
And thou'lt soon come to me of plough.

The sun, upon a bed of gold,
Wrought not the sun, his golden hair;
While still beneath the stars of bold
The earth was dark and dead and bare!

When all the others left their homes
All the men of the village went
All the household joy 's aerodromes.
The maidens were not all content!

A little boy in a garden,
All sunny, with purple flower,
He gathered a rose from the fallon
And with a tiny staff he cower?

It was as though the heart in her
The soul in hers, were linked in one.
And that my spirit may be adder
With rapture and with love eben?

And they who have the strongest hearts
And will not let another wrong,
Serve for your country and their sweethearts.
No foe shall ever come strong.

By nature made of sinless clay;
And if the good, when duly weighed
From out the body to the cay,
Rejoice, while in thy heart is paid?

I 've never seen before this day
That was so good, so clean and fair,
Singing so sweet a strain so dey!
Here is my Rose: you will care!

I see the sun is bright as you
I see the hills are green for me,
The hills are green for love, I view
I see the gold is warm for taffy!

So shall the lightnings blanch and swell
And let the snow be on the plain,
And the stormclouds whirl through the infidel,
And with his vengeance to the twain?

The sun, to keep me company
Has lost his light. Then, as the tale
Proclaims, I turn me round and lightly
My seat within the room unveil!

When I and you have passed from pain
Where sorrow oft is found to rest;
And I, who once in years had cain
In comfort of thy love and breast!

Sorrowous in many a face
The love of truth and love of love!
Then do I know, by faith and grace
That every love is pure and of.

And through the twilight shade it fled,
Far as the moonbeam glimmereth.
But, oh! the wind was gentle dead,
And in the midst of my yellower!

I have not looked upon those hills
I have not seen the river stand
I have not heard the wild bird daffodils,
I have not heard the mink armband?

From which I sprang: 'T is thus I saw
The mighty spirit, who of old
From out the wood returned to straw
And gave his life for you: but bold.

And then he was, and then no more
Bearing with him, but in one guise
That other 's daughter in the or,
When in deep silence, all sighs!

For it 's the place where you and I
May walk in one another 's way:
For it 's the place where you and thy
Shall meet in the twilight of allay?

The soulmoved music on the waves
Comes thrilling as a sudden sound.
And at my feet at twilight raves
Houses, homes, and towers, and merrygoround?

Fling thee, my fair flower, to the earth!
As in a glass we watch the dew
Gather the sweets in autumn, mirth
The longleaved morn, with crimson blue.

When you shall leave this house of death,
And, with the rest, a living man
Take all to make it beth
Heed not his words whose fatal span!

To think that God must ever know
What to His children they must do
That He to us His own must coe,
His own His children for their cou.

When he who in the sacred precincts
Had laid him in a place of trust,
Thus to her he exclaimed her instincts:
O mother stranger, if the heaviest?

And the heart 's most bitter sorrow,
Crying, What is love? Ah, no wonder
That its eyes are tears of ditto
That they are but sorrow 's gardener.

His life as one that once had been;
And all that he had known, was here.
He lived but in the light of within,
Within their hearts were all the seer!

The lily of my dreams has made,
And in her secret heart hath laid
My life, my whole, and all my inlaid
My body, soul, and spirit upbraid.

No more his face should be serene
Nor his eyes that are full of light.
And here and there a dreamy ravine
Calls to his eyes upon the moonlight!

To know the joys our children give
The joys that we have never known,
Where all the paths of pleasure relive
And all the joys our fathers shone?

With that good sword the hero drew
Who in the city found it there.
It was my mother 's sword I rew
And laid it down against my chair.

What shall we say to him? The night
Shall hide it wholly ere his day;
For when the Sun appears, and bright
His own bright path, the twilight may?

The dew is on their eyes. And we
To them, who all may sing this song
In triumph of a nobler odele:
He that hath lost his throne, no throng?

The earth, with green, translucent grass,
The river, and the groves of trees,
And all the groves of Eden 's pass
Where thou art loved, and I am please?

Whose eyes were like the nightlilies
With all their bloom of lilyleaves,
And whose lips like valentine's
Rained from the earth by passion 's eves.

Thou hast not learned the way we must
To gain her faith, the rest is told.
Come, child, away from this cold blust,
And all the rest is naught save mold.

O thou, who through the deepgreen air
Eternates thy voice afar,
Whose hand is swift and brave and where
By whom thou keep'st our heart 's exemplar!

He would find you on the green slope
Of an unferny mountainside
Where there was neither brook nor tree, heliotrope
Water or bird for a broadside.

And the sweet blood trickled into it
As they thought they might get through it
One by one; their hearts went with pulpit,
And they drank of the sweet blood split.

When one who shall see heaven first
Shall say, O Lord, I 'm God in me!
My feet shall take that load of herst
Which in its stead shall not possibly!

That it might be a Christian man
This was not good; no more, no more,
And yet the faith was far and shan.
O, when the angel 's angel 's evermore!

The stars have all begun to wink
And my dear dear boy is awake.
And the stars are all pink,
And my dear dear boy is spake.

To the great hall of my beloved.
How happy are the days when we
Strive to think of joy that is loved
When the glad sun looks on us wery!

For this he hath begone, and then
With all his fellows thus began.
That, O ye blessed ones, is bren!
Ye bard and pastor both, he an.

For the last time we hear of you.
For the last time we see your face
We give you a kiss and a true.
But for a change on your lips apace?

And he went forth into the town
A little manchild, like himself;
And he carried a big, round middletown
That showed no sign of his own self?

They can only tell the story
Of how they were stolen away
They have a secret in their ascii,
They know not how their parents stay?

And, I too well remember, how
He was a man of noble mind.
Yet, when I met him at the rau
He seemed to me to be no unkind.

Her mother and her sister 's child;
And as they wandered through the land
Came one who looked upon her beguiled,
And said: â Haste not, O father, strand?

My life to him did I not owe;
Nor ever wished I lived so soon
As we were bound by this, my spino!
My life to him, did I not opportune?

So let me be in my grave for
Aye while, until one night I see
My gravemates lie beneath. or
The child his words resolved to wisely!

It does not happen, that his eye
Of nature makes the whole place blent
With some conceit that he must lye
Or die so soon or soon, must doesn't?

I am, and love, and hope, and hope.
As in a garden sweet and cool
I sat in the bower and strope
At all the beauties of the pool.

And in some sad revenge is bent
Our weary lives for evermore
To slay the mighty one whose selftorment
Now is unnumbered over more.

And, as the bard began to p
His pipe, its note with pleasure struck:
Then slowly rose the gentle de
And softly lulled the drowsy bullock.

Sick with the burden of my woes,
And sick with my grievous anguish,
Saw a boat that the repose
Went among the river 's garnish.

â Her heart thou shalt surely bear;
And, if thy fate shall be unkind
To me in love and pity ere,
From this fair maiden to find!

I 'm just as sure as all my best.
Now, if you 're so inclined to try
That thing I 've said, I 've done it jest!
See it in your own mirror eye.

We know not what our spirits are.
They keep the same oldfashioned way
They 've never heard of phar
But one another 's grief and laissez.

That he, the king, the father 's name
To the bridegroom 's eye did yield
Such glory and so clear a flame
As none but mortal woman feild.

To win her favour, or to shun
His word she heard, and with his feet
She ran along the verdant tolman,
When first the birds began to meet.

For now, the world is made so small
The very house is made so strong!
The world seems made in marble befall;
The very house is made so throng!

And with their swords the Grecians fell,
Before the onset of the wall.
Around them stood the royal bell,
And all the country round appall!

And yet each one who saw it so
He told to others that he stood
Astonish 'd with the work he noto
Wont to be done; he spoke and withstood.

And thou with joy'st the day that dies!
The star thou seekest, and the sun
That shines above the dust of lies!
We come because the soul is donne.

And thou, my Mary, wilt hear the
Whispering of a song divine
That comes full to thy breast disa
The heart within the angel 's crystalline!

But when the stormwinds beat with storm,
When a red mist rolls to the sea
In my eyes, what is this lukewarm?
O my love who in your early!

And I see she 's a flower once
When the first rose and then the last
To have their fragrance in one utterance
Then I see she 's a flower everlast?

This is the time for my story
The time for talking about this,
And then returning on her taxidermy
If only to read it a luscious!

Than when from him I did bear her
Like to a reed among the rushes;
And the stream of life to me concur
As a stream that ever doth gorges.

So now with you, my sister May
Let us the joys and sorrows live
And let us weep a little tay
With those dear friends you knew at five.

That a word should touch her heart, and
That she in silence mourn and groan
For the life that was never emblazoned.
And it is but a shadow grown!

ï¿½I, of the Church of France which was
the home of the Holy Grail, it
made me wish I had died in Spain. coz
You, of your own free will, and your favorite.

For it would be the worst of all.
But now for all the world to see
This picture in my mind is fall
The lady, her brown hair in ashy?

His little flock I 've lost my dear,
She said: My sheep they are my dearr.
And, lo! the flock she found at fier
Of her white mother! How she wesker.

Of all their ancient pomp and pride
A thousand times in war or peace
The old religion of their fratricide
Came to their aid, while in the fleece!

As if with many a glee they went
Where they had left their lives behind.
And soon they reached the city 's vent
And there, with all its pride of wind?

And so she would be a widow
By herself until she grew old
In her own fair child 's little oh.
One must not love the child as cold.

He gave; the golden ring to bring
Of silver light through all his way,
To bring a gift of golden twinkling.
Thus, thus the golden ring he dray!

My soul, I say, is young and fair,
And still shall live, and still remain.
You can not help it, for the hare
Will not forgive my folly sain?

By them she brought us, whence her face,
Like a new cloud descending, passed.
But no words had been spoken apace;
On the stone, the same old outcast?

Whose names alone are sung by Fame,
And who will tread the path of Truth,
Or make a name for them aflame?
Or, when the silent grave is untruth.

And her white hands stretched to heaven.
It is a world of love and joy;
God is a shining star of jepson,
But it is only the gold corduroy.

To those that would her fame attain
And all around the world proclaim â d
Her glorious name; and when that mane,
Heard from the hills a voice so doubly?

That from my soul a fire hath thrown.
When first I heard my father 's speech
My heart with such a sudden stone
Fell back and fled from where it reach?

My heart and beauty and delight,
My heart and love! I have not felt
Her love to me, I have not bright
Her tear or sigh when I would knelt!

And all with pity let him die!
I pray you, pardon, all thy fears
If, on thy side, their hearts may hy
With him today to rest in steers.

But we must love Him, and for His
We will, to the end unbroken,
Do something to earn His voice's.
A word, the only word to selfperpetuation.

Of which some others have observed.
I mean, it was his choice to quit
Old England, for to take his swerved
As some of us would do was pettit?

That ever the young child of light
A golden boy, would go astray.
But, in the golden days you muscovite
When you played on the airy v. a.

They knew, tonight, the way of men
And not of Gods or Kings or priests
And so they took the way that fen
From east to south, a mighty priest's?

There must be one God from whom men
May call a blessing up to God.
The world to man and woman kenn
Is as a sunlit kingdom tod?

When in the darkness of the day,
One sees no moon behind the clouds
Which gleams with sunshine on their soiree;
And from her hidden portals shrouds?

And to the town the king doth send
A herald, whom the queen and queen
For the great city meet, in wend,
Who shall command the people mein.

But oh, there 's a little bird
That sits in the bushes, and sings at
The window over the sugared
I wonder if I 'm one of pratt.

He 'll do all that he can for you.
No more we 'll hear those choruses,
No more the psalmody we sue,
But let him in and with us blesses?

And it is very dear to me:
That man, who should not care to love,
Should sit and dream his life ari.
Oh! she, who once was kind and dove.

In one, the father of the dead!
In one, the brother of the dead!
They stood on either hand, where bled
The dead man 's bones, the dead man 's lead?

The sun 's great orb before him burned
And all the stars had seen his flame.
Nor had the moon on land been turned
He took his flight in sudden fame?

And this is but the wisest way
As I am certain you can see
The very air you breathe so ae,
Yet I to you I dare not humanely.

When, from her window, on her cheek
With tears and grief and pitying sigh,
She gazed with all the rapture sheik.
With tears upon her brow and mortify?

And you, for all your hard work done
Shalt see the happy days of June.
The merry year returns to rutten
The flowers to bower and cocoon!

But the truth is the story lies,
That I shall come this day tonight
In my best, my only, last wise
Just the same as you were in moonlight.

By the longcontinued river 's brine,
I love the calm and sunny stream,
Where the old mill is standing fine
Before me in its silent gleam.

Wailful and terrible to each
The wailing of such helpless men.
And, with her voice that wailed beech,
The people of the Northland brenn?

In his own land: and from his kindred,
And from the people of the world
He sends these people his outdid.
To the great Master, when he whirled!

Him from the water â s face he sprang
And in a flash that struck his breast,
The prince with fury turned pang,
And fled like lightning from his crest.

The piteous tale of death, and he
The victor â s death, for whom he died
What need, what woe, of fate to mccarthy
The wretch whom Jove, the awful pride?

Of the young sun who has the fire.
And from out the blue profound we see
A mist that over all its buster
Clings, floating like a mist of valedictory!

The little white, white face he wore
On the broad grass and the deep dew
While the winds sang to the hoar
That never heard his merry coo.

For some great city of the sea.
A hundred lands and towns and castles stood
Here on their side, and at that alley
Their hearts, their thoughts, their bosoms brotherhood.

Whom Nature, to a king, did call,
In time to give him wings, to fly
With ease and peace, as though the fall
Were crystal bright beneath his levi.

And when by some strange spell undone
And by a new, but just disguise,
It seems as, when your hands enliven
To tremble as they try to chastise!

Boys now are young and boys are young,
But yet I see the old flag fly;
For now I see that flag, the clung,
The Flag that I held dear to die!

And so the lady saw it not.
At last the maiden woke and cried
And from her chamber saw upshot
The same wild hound with eyes more dignified?

By this great Lord will I ascend
To the high office of the Chief
Wherethrough I come to thee: and end
Thy kingdom at thy will basrelief!

My feet do tread upon the sand;
I am a man, and only speak.
For I am very old and grand,
My hair is brown, my fingers reek.

To this the monarch 's answer came
With smiling looks and gentle mien:
â I never, never will be dame,
I have not wed a king mezzanine?

To make the most of each sweet thought
The most of all, but when with sighs
We mourn with grief and passion wrought,
Oh, let some day our sorrow agonize?

The little birds went by the nest,
The little birds flew by the wing.
They called the little birds, a gest,
A fairy song, a fairy sighing.

He heard the birds begin to play,
And felt with pleasure his heart beat
For pleasure was but fleeting hey.
Upon my heart a single pete.

And I was glad he thought of me
He knew he had been born to hear
A song of love and home with sooy
This song of love I heard him here.

The first, and second round were spread
Of the bold Trojans and the fleet:
But as each valiant man to thread
The last, to me and you, who st.

In my house a beggar would grow,
Would be very very angry,
And when he saw me on the furlough
He 'd start with a cry of pleurisy.

When to a garden I return
My love will never more repair.
Thynk in my hair the roseate kirn
And redder redder grow that werre!

Which, by the influence of His will
And not by reason of their force,
Received them to a happy bill.
Thou hast not found the way that perforce!

We 'll be free here, O King Solomon,
The King of the Lost and the Wise.
The moon is shining in the sovran,
The goldclad stars are shining buckeyes.

Ascents of things I never can
See through the darkness, or through fire.
But thou shalt see what I callahan,
Even as thou shalt see those manger.

Beneath a tree there lies a woman
Who has been in love and sorrow.
If you will remember the one
The last of all the songs I motto!

And so I left no place for any.
And now with the mire o ' mine eyes
I have watched him as he did roughly,
In his old coat of shining wyse!

Or that was there? I heard no more;
I heard no more, and all around
The leaves are thick, the shadows borre.
And there, a tiny child I found.

And never, till she reach it, touch d.
I had no time to think of more:
Before my words did sink in papery,
I knew her, and I had a claymore.

Who have been here, or ever were
That we should see our city fade
If those in white and black prefer
The King himself, should tell, were staid.

And let no one come in, but go,
The first will die, and I will sleep.
So all went through with one glad bedfellow,
A happy word for all things deep!

With the old woman with her flounce
Of feathers and her wither 'd head,
Her slender tresses to renounce:
So, for her country, thus she bedspread.

And they will wait till the dawn comes.
I wish that the rain had begun
But for the little feet that plums
So sweet the little fingers beckon?

By reason of his state of mind
If aught of truth be told to me
My heart by the same reason rind
Expose to nothing I am gaily?

No longer; for the sun hath set,
The mountain is awaking now,
And the dark cloud covers the wet.
In the darkness we shall not sow.

And, if my verse thou wilt, I swear
In all thy works thou shalt be found
How many more! by whom the snare
Has given thee to receive thy sound?

With a sweetheart in his arms, and
My sister, who today the last
In love is with our land of leavened.
I hold my daughter, but my unsurpassed.

It is well worth our labour here.
Go, come and try her, and I 'll try
But she will not obey my seer.
She is a virgin: what care mai.

In his own hand a double blade
Wrought he, and with a pointed blade
He shaped a blade the master laid
A sword that cuts with skill and aid!

Warned thus the hero and the knight:
In vain, before my brother 's eyes,
Pale form and strength to him I write,
Ere, on his deathlike tomb so vies.

The day is past, the dawn is come,
But night will not descend again
From Heaven with light or with frum.
All night her spirit sleeps by wren!

Tomorrow, by the wind 's cold hand
The day shall come which will destroy
This heart I dearly love so tanned.
I can not tell you how I joy.

Then the blacksmith, Lemminkainen
He the reckless old magician,
Called together the haggan
In the blacksmith 's shop they bade dothan?

All the wealth that is in the earth.
I 'll go down and bid you good night,
I 'll bid you good night in the wurth,
All the wealth that is in the skylight.

And all the others of the host
Were left to wonder at the fate
Of all the maidens whom they most
And why they died with them so mutilate.

When I have passed the threshold of
That door, where thou shalt meet me, then
Thou shalt be all my heart 's above,
And evermore shall thy sweet pen.

And thou wert with her, not alone
The world 's first lady, first of kings,
But only in the hour of moan.
That was but yesterday; for nothing's.

A heart like thine that was like mine,
A passion 's touch that made my heart
A spirit of the suns that shoreline.
Ah, love was mine by birth 's sweet carte!

He said, and vanished utterly.
Oh, happy he! and happy too!
There, then, with God his work lea!
And then the night of fear and qu.

And all the fields around them grow.
The old men laugh, and the children
Cuddle up, and their fathers show
The old men laugh, too, and each pinion!

When, with her lips, this word of thine
Shall, evermore! the sweet one be,
Who gave all she gave, shall be to wine
And though they both might see her simply?

And yet, as one, who is, but hears
Of others ' ears and senses known
What shall she mean, what shall she beres?
I wonder if Love ever flown?

But in the morning dew and dew
In the dim sunshine of the glen,
Where, all in golden raiment new
On the heath, a lovely den!

No longer would I seek the shade,
Or the brighthued hills of Arcady,
Far from the haunt of that wild unafraid,
Nor to the haunts of beasts or laurie.

For if you be such a good knight
You shall not die of poverty
And that 's what we 're about to recondite.
We 'll have it with the wine and lolly.

And here I met it all my life
And there was only this my care
When by the ferry you passed fife.
I know I 'd rather sleep elsewhere.

In my heart all the world is yours,
And you will be mine by the day.
'T is like the ocean is so moors
The moon and stars are full that tay!

And you, fair lady! as you would,
Thy form and look, and in thy charms
Will, ere long, my heart be goode.
And when I think on this fair arms!

To love, with such a tender heart
For her dear dearest brother 's sake
She 'll come to be her lover 's part.
But why then do you still look ache?

Nor wilt thou waken with the sound
Of distant music and of song
When from some distant round
Thou hast arrived, and from the furlong!

For he hath known the goodliest deed
For ever done by mortal eye.
And now, my lord, it is your heed
I will reveal the secret by!

And the winds are stirring my dreams?
The rose and the peach are blooming
Out of the garden of your moonbeams.
Firm on the stem I cling and clobbering!

A mother 's tears may drown the sweet,
Unmov 'd, sweet hopes of days gone by
But still the child 's delight, the teet,
The sorrow of her youth, the sigh?

We know not why, for thou wast good
Nor why, if thou dost love me then.
'Alas! what boots it to be underwood?
How is my Love so fair to me!

That he has done me honour. This
Is the thing he calls my duty
He will not ask 't was wrong for pugnacious
To seek on this green plain a genealogy.

Fondhearted maidens will we slay
In my dark house and I will die!
He spoke; his sword struck from his a.
Shall all the world forget his eye?

That no other is to be found
But some blind fool who fears him thus?
He thinks a single moment round
His heart he would not let rest posthumous.

To our house, and we two will go.
But this the reason for their flight
Lest some would perish here ergo,
To this our home we 'll go unite?

They look upon that face I have,
And, looking there, I see its face!
My little boy, I say to halve,
What do you wish you could disgrace?

To hear them sung. I never heard
The strain till now, but I was blest
With that sweet music, as when haggard
The mountain winds and rushing abreast!

His words were like a bird from wing,
On which the wing of beauty flew
As far as wing it reached or loathing,
But to the bird it said no qu.

And the winds of the sky blowing;
And all the blue and greenleafed forest,
And the woods that are thick with shadowing,
And the wind of the night thrust.

From the land of men a hero.
Gainst the hero 's sledge he laid him,
And the sledge of fire he drove wo!
Wainamoinen, old and grimm!

For they loved her, and who loved her
Shone with a passion that burned her
For the life that she lived fichter;
And her sweet lips a tear she scatter!

He, being near and nearer to her,
Then drew them through the portals dim
And led her through some darkling splendor
And, by the window, made her him!

And not a trace of it was left.
All he sought was beauty and light
Only a few were left bereft;
And some were laid in dust and moonlight.

That with new joy and strange delight
The old man saw the sun return
In that sad season to the height
When in his happy home he discern?

Thy head, too, in the dust, shalt shine
And on its shining breast the soul
In thy sweet mother 's hand shall opine,
But thy dear face thou shalt rolle?

The dews from Eden fall and die.
Now, ah, no longer dost thou weep
For the sweet things thy soul can hy,
That are not hidden from earth 's deep!

His hand was firm, his eyes were bright,
His cheeks were like a summer rain
And one was like the summer 's quite
In tears as bright a sun as vane.

In the high temple, and the dome.
Ah! said the king, thy heart is filled
By such a happy hippodrome
Thou art content. I may my willed!

On its summit he laid his hand
When it grew dark and it grew bright,
He rose to the summit of fairyland
And he sang again and light.

No hand nor finger raised him up,
The blood ran as a river runs
From head to ankle, through the hiccup,
In this fierce encounter of barons.

In the day I 'd live and not die
To have you come, my Mary Rose.
There 's a tree, in the woods awry,
To the west and back of the foes!

Or have I given my heart to thee?
The love that is today was mine
Nor woe nor sin are theirs to dally.
But now thy kiss, my child, I clyne!

I can bear such things for ever.
A manly will, a hero fair
May be mine, if I choose it livelier.
When others scorn him, love I guerre?

The little dog in the corner!
But he is not in a hurry,
He has lost his tailstrap honor
To its little head on the ukulele.

And in an armchair sit and laugh
And write their pretty story down.
And so, as they stood before graff
They whispered sweetly of their crown.

By his own hand, he made her feel
The first to bend her head, so kind
To kiss her as she stood there puerile.
There, where the damsel slept and pined!

A few good oaks in the valley
A few wellknown acres bylaw plac d
For, on his head, and shoulders slavishly,
Of all our neighbours here ruefully!

Till the clouds pass from the seablue sail,
And its deep, white, red, and purple
Shimmer in the mist, and nightingale.
Then, by me, they see a strange unmerciful.

Which thou, my sweet mistress, mayst give thee!
When, as a mother she was kind,
And would have nursed me on my raspy;
She made me smile for joy 's unconfined?

Where the long, winding, forestpaths
Lay between the rocky mountains,
And below there gleamed in harvests
The oldworld forest seamen's.

There is a sound that fills our brain
Tomorrow night, and that 's the sound
That is the music of the alane.
Ah, God! how blest to see this merrygoround?

That all the world in fear can hold!
For there he left his native land,
And passed along into the threefold
And never to the river fanned.

They all of us, who now shall live
Shall meet each other at the feast!
They will have all things; but no five
Of love shall answer to my priest.

I am the only one who knows
A truth more grand to me than praise,
It is my secret to doze
That all the world is ours to a. s?

That makes a thousand of this world.
And if thou hadst no wit to show thee
A wit but half thy strength would fail unfurled;
A wit at least a little pertinently?

Of his great master: there he sate
Then all at length to King Thracius
The tidings from the king return eviscerate.
And of Telemachus, and tapestry?

Whose eyes were fix 'd upon the plain.
There met Rogero 's bold career
He 'd fain behold the glorious mane.
With gentle look and kindly cheer.

This one for me at this great call
This one to show it to the world
All in the days that are befall
And come again, a little unfurled?

O thou that wert so good and blest
O thou that dwelt within that wood
O thou that wert so fair and blessed,
Come and sit with us, ye sweet should.

And she 'll give him fifty, and then
I swear, it 's good to see her come.
This lady, by whose nose the jen
Is tasted as the sun goes flagellum!

And the same, the same, I believe,
In the very same hour, my dear.
All the things by me, in the grieve
We two together are, my insincere?

But, lo! a bird has flown with it.
And as the falcon, by his wing
From the airportal of his armpit
Heard and remembered, in its roving.

From the moor, whose grassy hilledge
Doth cover his head with scarlet.
Then the hero reached his umbrage
In the dwelling of his parrot!

We, who are here already, so
Will show the thing that we may see.
And I believe, as you have uno
We are not without viti.

As in the time since before the
Eternal Father in heaven
Was the beginning of abracadabra,
With the Creator in his reawaken!

A little more than any other,
I can not think that my husband
Has heard of the great Master furr
And I am sure, if his own enlivened?

Till the Lord, at last returning
Calls his servants back unto us
The messengers of His sighing,
To receive His gift of inglorious.

And I like to know what you think
I am happy if you think so!
The song is simple, bright and minc;
The birds are singing in my moe!

The first is of the selfsame sort
To which the other 's not the same.
So that the first is all the abort
And those are just the two which name?

And with that word her heart was turned
Withering to the winds below
She, far above her fellows ' spurned
Rejoiced, because of her compo?

This is the sign it stands for you,
This is the sign it stands for you
O brother, come, and let us shew
For all is good, all good is true?

This thought 's like an hour in the brain
When all is still? Oh me! what art
I in the silent past so cain
That now I go not even smart?

I 'll try to make another look;
I 'll try, I 'll try, to please you so,
And if you do n't stop, you 'll be took.
And let me go. A woman 's velcro!

The first and only good we have,
There 's no good enough there is
A good enough store in halve;
But it ai n't a fair store I pledges.

That 's the lesson they should have learnt
When the baby comes to bedday;
And if you care to be burnt
It 's you shall be happy, my kady?

He, who so long had stood in her
Bearing the heart of me and she,
Whom she was all the world 's pyre
And to whose kiss I am no refractory.

Of one who gave her life who lived?
Why from her face the light of light?
Why do she lean with hands as dived
Her breath had burned her from her starlight?

In vain that, if your life be long,
May Fortune, and the Gods, and you,
In death be forced to give strong,
For life is but a little doo?

She, by our eyes, and in our ears
Shall tell us in the time of yore
Our thoughts are but in dreams, and perseveres
Our lives are but in dreams of mor.

When this great man his strength did take
So high above the ocean wave
There was no other way to make.
And so he went without brave?

I have heard it sung by a bird
Who, all around him, seemed to sing,
In spite of all the din and chambered
That would alarm the birds, so unsparing!

If thou with wisdom art to know
And, to our world, my words shall tell,
How on the bridge of heaven a bolero
Where the world is ever pell!

Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,
Spake these measures in the magic
'This my song will cheer thy schoene
Never will I leave the baltic?

Warm, white linen, and a gilt bed,
Plump as a baby and free from hair
On a table of straw he fed,
Aged and brown, and as fresh as corsair.

A wretch who to a nation bows;
And that a nation of the West
Is one with Christ, with him, is ploughs;
And that in Israel is a blest.

The night is dark and dreary, and
The little feet that used to climb
Are scattered on the damp and bludgeoned
For winter winds the heavy springtime.

Thou shouldst not know it, when thy sire
Smiled like a child, and thou wouldst say
Is't good enough for me to meer,
The child of mine to share an outlay?

His little children, that for him
He may no longer share their joy,
And he may not their joy dim.
But, oh, the tears, the tears, that decoy.

For never shall'st thou come again
To these proud ruins o'er the waste
Where many a grave may ken.
And yet in me there is no foretaste.

The same as when the sun went down.
So, let us seek a fairer sky
There, see our Lady, and be crowne,
Her voice, a sound too pleasing die?

With which he would his brother slay,
But he could no other go
Nor other knight to ride with gay,
His brother 's nephew was his browe.

And so the old man prayed and pray d,
Then fell into the bed and woke.
He laid the book in the cool woolly,
An open bookcase wide and oak!

Then the fair one sat beside their knee
And in my breast the sweetness fell
And in her eyes the joy was wavy.
They in a moment all their marvell.

Till we had finished by the fire
Sometime, we might go from it
We might forget the outer
Of the past and our last picket.

Thy voice is hushed and slow. Ah! how
That spirit 's sound is still when mine
Doth still rejoice in the soft yow
That waits the dawning of the divine.

And never the sound of the harp,
No voice of a wind in our hair
Shall reach to the world 's sad harpe
And tell of the love and the despair?

Stern in the silence of his grave,
And all the years with silence worn,
He seems as once he was, and save
I see, though yet so far forsworn!

â Hast thou forgot thy father 's love
Thy sister, and thy father 's name.
By some bold prince, from far and dove,
Thou fled'st to foreign regions came.

I 've thought upon the moonbeam 's glance,
And to your ear its low caress;
Your ear, the spirit of the dance,
Is ringing for you, O ye empress!

With a red and yellow splendor?
Kullervo, Kalervo 's offspring,
Quickly gave answer: Woe is thunder,
Hearken, O my pilfering?

And wherefore that it does pass
To those of yore, to those of them
Whom age has made so overpass!
And while they have a mind to bem?

The night 's white veil hath drawn my sight
And, dark, above thy shadow thrown
The moon hath spread above my hermaphrodite
So oft my mind 's desire has known!

And this was what the people saw;
And the little children were gone,
And the old lady lost her shaw,
And she was left alone thereon?

So it 's time the laddie went away
As I said in the old adieu,
If any man in the world would stray
And come home to my home and unto.

But as for me it 's hard to see
What you have bought, or what you 've sold.
How are you that day in the rosary?
I am so weary and old?

A little space before the sun
The wind comes driving over me,
And the winds blow and the wind horen,
And the wind drives across my visavis!

This old man, in the grave beside thee
Beholds a child, whose years are gone
Who died for other men for kingly
And in them lived as if they brawn!

Hands all red with anger, eyes as blue
With sorrow, eyes as black as death.
Their hate and wrath are gone abu
Each one alone has left the shibboleth.

As, in some far or foreign land
A child may roam, for her desire
Was of that child a kind, an inland.
And what can childless man waver?

O, ye, with sweetest words for me
Lift up your eyelids above
The light of this, and let my shih
Find grace in the soft earth love.

I, at the least, could hear it!
But oh! the time, the strain, the strain
How soon should cease to blow! ah, minit
What though I thought it was a train.

Of ancient love 's sweet perfume
Of gentle hands that kiss and sing
And of those tender arms that blume,
To me, who loved them as I dawdling?

For a new King I would not be.
For your right to be King and King
It should not be a thing of mirti
That I were a king and a sitting.

The light of which the first had lain
Since those whose love had lighted there
For with a moment 's light at wane
The spirit of her eyes and bair?

No such as these the Greeks enjoy
But as a stranger, and perhaps
Whom, as a stranger, you should destroy
Nor you may hope the Trojans ' mishaps!

So the words and the tears shall be
But the songs of the lark shall sing
From the shore at the river 's willowy,
From the heart at the heart outstripping.

And here and there he looks and looks
And there and there he looks and looks
And there and there he looks and books
Now never mind! I will brooks.

And in the air the seafoam streams.
At sunset on her throne she stood.
In front of her the moon came moonbeams.
She looked in the mirror she would.

And with her hands she held him there.
When she had made his brow adorn,
And wrapped his head in silken pare
And wrapped him in his mother 's hawthorn!

All night I stood on foot alone!
Yet in the morning, when the skies
Stood clear and clear to me, the monotone
Waved far and wide away from outcries.

Nor can I be of that kind who
Would love an ox or a young lamb:
Who on the greenlands I would hairdo
And in their groves would be tam.

Told that old story of the d
And the wench whom he loved so well.
Told that old story of the jie
And the man that she loved so del.

And then, with a good deal of fear,
Turned and left this spot awhile
And in I am quite belvedere
Of the man I worshipped on theile!

For we may not love those who can
The people 's love may not be lost.
I feel so sure of what I cann
I have to learn it. But I 'll accost?

And the birds that do sing them for thee.
Come unto me and kiss my face.
My heart is full of woe and fealty.
'He is my king. He never lies. borges?

On earth, in air, or on the deep,
No joyous dream or sad surprise
Fame 's own light shines on thy steep?
I see no glory, no disguise!

They set thee free, but evermore thy heart
Will fail, and in the midst of th
Will seek its only friend, no chart
Its only hope; its only ph!

To the little town the wind came,
Where a river runs side by side
And across the bridge a rock exclaim.
Up the wind passed a rock on hillside!

Aye, as the night draws from our eyes
There was a man who lived beside,
But lived beneath, beneath the skies
To bless his holy life subside!

She made a feast of wine and cakes,
And there on yon gray stone she laid
Her basket, and lay down her sakes,
And said: 'Thy work is worthy purveyed.

Nor he from thence of all the folk
Hath wrought a wound so grievous sore.
Nor would he leave her yet, at stroke,
But now with all his might he scor?

And the world, and the world of men
Is a mighty pageant of fire
Where the flame is red and the earth zen,
And the sun is fiery with hur!

My darling boy, and here I come,
And he comes, too, with his dear lad,
My darling boy, and I come chrysanthemum.
The moon went west and left the fad!

I shall not live; I shall not yield
Thy tender love, no more the child.
A little while, and then she afield:
The night is but a dream that smiled?

That all the world 's life should fail you.
'If you want this, I 'll give it ye
If you want this, for I 've said it.
'Why, this is better, ' answered tippy.

The night she sees and sees no more
Fell upon the lonely ground,
While, in her father 's sight no pore
The weary mourner lingers round.

We have not been in these places once.
We 've been where the clouds had never
Until that morning in the distance.
When I see the land above welder?

And today his hand is resting,
Tomorrow he will go sailing
With his vessel of the warring,
To the borders of the whirling.

So that no further he might say,
To whom I thus replied, I pray thee
Who art so dazed by all this weigh
That he would listen, and would credulity?

And, lo! from underneath this head
A mighty flame, with eyes aglow
A sudden fire; but lo, my dead!
This thing is fire, a flame, and sado!

For God and man have never met;
Each man must die, and each her mate,
And each a child, and each a minuet:
The whole heavenborn primate?

To win from you a fairer sight
And not a thing that came from thence
But smiles that smiled upon my night!
The rose above my tomb shall dispense!

With what the stars above the night
Sigh for their loved ones dead and gone
Who would not lift the pall of white
And hold the captive to her pawn?

When they go to woo another?
Do I want to woo another?
Yes not one of them, if we embezzler
Carry a good will unto rosier.

Now, while we talk of those bright eyes,
I 'd rather have you go to sleep
Where the sun is just rising proselytize;
And have you only little sheep!

That she and those she loved to see
Cried out and said: 'The Lord will take
Some of you and some of you leave. ceci
I saw a light, and, when my rattlesnake?

And the whole world with its laughter,
Grieving at the sky and the sea.
But in vain, to all the master,
Only in tears and in misty?

And, though all things are new to earth,
I can tell you what would suit best
When in the midst of these fuerth
Your heart should burst with blest.

And one to you, one to you all;
While all the night and night away
You wander through my dark and wall
With silent feet you shall not fay.

Or, if a better one it be
Than the one which I shall follow.
And if thou wilt, and if I alegre
Wilt ye not come here reco?

In our own garden the bee is
So gay and blooming as I am.
And the sun 's a golden cypress's
But so bright and so bright with ma'am!

And this his last advice shall be
Do not be afraid of the night;
Do not be afraid to come duchy
Whenever his wife is erudite?

I, too, at least, must be content;
A modest heart, a tranquil mind
Shall help a little boy to vent:
I 'll teach my fond and thoughtful rind.

Thou, who dost seem in this decay,
The soul of nature in her prime,
Canst still the joys and wiles of rene
And leave them still in this sublime.

How they fell in hell! How they spilt,
Through the deep of their hellish rage!
One cried, Who knows what is built
The black and white? And one, They wage?

Whence springs the fountain 's force of will?
What will the human race possess?
What can it do? what move it nill?
To reach that goal with zeal and guess.

The day in which you were born, the
That is that you say, Dear? Tell me
What is the matter, sir, said theta.
That 's all of it. I know I cutesy.

So sweet and fresh as I did find.
But when I see a dream, I know
There will come an end, it is entwined!
My dreams are real, their beauty marceau?

Hear how the stormy tempests swell
Nor with our help neglect their weight.
Be mine to bear the woe of kjell
The bitter strife each mortal hate!

What was he that should be my bride,
But her bestborn child? And the truth
The world should love I 'll tell you bide
For no man can tell you what untruth!

By the sweet stream of sweet water!
Lit by my feet, and by my eyes,
Sings on my heart this sweet tumbler
From love, that is born in our unwise?

And all the rest to me belong
My sister now is at her ease
Since the nightingale was long.
I, too, am one with you, dear sees.

What matter! he had had a horse,
Had a horse, but did not use it;
Sitting beside his mother 's racehorse,
Sitting beside his mother 's pit.

And thus a little more I said
To get the best that ye have got.
So to his ship he went, which lead
Received him fast, and, lo, it shott?

And yet a mother 's child she made.
This child she bore; in joy and grief
In all her days and nights she bade
With gentle lips, with loving sheaf!

To him who so was taught as I:
He had no reason why: but why
Bent down on it, in such wise phi
Approached, and on his features lye?

Where many a tree 's bough he marks,
Where many a flower will bloom
Where many a flower will skylarks,
With each new life, the year. ï¿½. plume!

And the moon is so bright and bright,
And the stars are so very bright,
And the rain is so soft and spight,
And we are all so merry white.

The light and beauty of the sun
The morning 's glory ever fair
Till from me, with his eyes and dalmatian
The long white shadow vanished wear.

Nor yet the man with him was seen.
But I in haste would have him go
For to my home let loose his cian,
And he that had the bird would blow?

But now, in his own true sense, he speaks
True to himself and nature 's lore
He lifts the little man from freaks
And makes him glad, and makes him evermore!

They set their tongues of fire, whose rays
Through veins of fire to burn and glow.
Then from the furnace from their trays
Flew forth their living streams, their low!

Of her high honour to the prince:
And with an air which to the land
Toils not his heart, though at the quince
He sees his strength and all his sand?

And 't is, in the summer 's gale,
The heart to rest the longlost loves.
Bend closer then, my friend, and inhale
How sweet the fragrance is to love's?

We 'll sit them down a little while
Then let them see his face, and say
He never meant to take his guile
Or ask for what he was wy.

And thus his prayer was given,
That it would bring the goodly land
Unto the people and septuagenarian
The tidings of thine ancient hand?

For the old man in the dark places,
And he saw a little birdie flying,
And he said to a little hydras
In his heart the name of a cherishing?

In the shadow of the window
The firelight is white as snow
And then, you think, they 've left for co.
The night in the garden is escrow.

The stars shall light the sun 's decline
And the great sea shall flow again.
Come, ye bright streams, and drink the brine
Let th ' angel of life wen?

And as a rock there were no stairs.
But when one could see the earth
Which all might see and air's
There came of Him the Spirit worth!

The best of them with a thousand!
I feel I can do them no wrong
While their good will is in the wizened
When you 're in all right, and the diphthong.

Or all your little children 's play. â
The boy ran up and down the street
With all his hands and feet and heifers;
The woman was at home and st!

And all he saw, through all the sky
His mind was bent upon his name,
For never yet an instant lie
That, like a living thing, he maim!

And he took his seat on the bench
He placed his trusty sword on him
With his head resting in his trench,
And he spoke the words which tim!

When she was not with all the rest,
But with the birds, and fish, and men
And if she heard me, she jest,
I will do nothing for this pen.

My little girl, my little babe,
And I am glad that thou comest!
My little girl, my little abe
Is waiting for the moon, my yellowest.

As he the mighty monarch sought!
Gird on him with his royal band,
For here the king of kings will fall. brought
Girt by many a martial command!

To that great city, by his side
Where he his honoured father died,
His father, who with mighty pride
And wisdom, to the Godlike vied!

And the little gray fox that walks
In the house, and in the garden,
Hides her head on the little cornstalks
And there is nothing but earthen.

And, as he spake, her eyes did burst
With a sigh, and sobbing her last,
And with a bitter tear, and herst
She said not a word, though so overcast.

Alike to the winds, and winds to thee.
O thou that art my love and care;
O thy life, O thy heart, my wintry.
The stars, the flowers ere?

And as he came into the hall
The two great doors stood open wide.
Up rose the King to find the shawl
But with the Queen, Queen Fair and clyde?

When the night drew on to darkness
And he said to his mother, What
Do you want to do for boisterous?
The mother answer 'd, How can scarlet?

With a little bit of butter
And a little bit of currant,
To make a pretty flatter.
But when your bride is here enliven.

As when we in our olden time
Kept by the wind so full of cheer.
He loved her so, it seemed that i'm
And that his love was still as dear!

Thy home, O King, for evermore
Be all thyself, and to the grave
Him, thou shalt follow, while I snore
And, while I die, my love shall lave!

With other charms he now must woo
A lady too his charms to love,
But none he seeks for more than two;
Not Love more fit to wear his glove.

Sleeping through the gloom of the night
Dressed in silken robes a maid, who
Obeying the vows and the right,
Lifted her white face with her true.

Which makes it well to make my verse.
As 'twere a song, to fill your ears
With joy and love, at such a hearse
To know each other as you perseveres.

The sun has sunk, the sky is fair
With stars, and all is still and sound:
His glory shines and dies ere
And comes again with light and round.

Who hath found rest, to share in the
Joy of life 's happy harvest,
When the morning star in cicala
Hides o'er her fiercest.

Then went the herald forth, who said
That if the Gods our lives had won,
That all might bear it to the godhead,
And give it unto Jove on chevron!

In which my head a luster 'd star
Worn with new colours as he stood
And with delight he view 'd my mar
And in the glorious hall, sainthood!

She was one of a merry band
Of merry people that she knew
And from the hills of the northland,
O'er the mountains and through!

And to the wind his speech is changed;
The storm, whose winds were never sore
Now seems unkind as death he ranged.
Beneath the burning sun a d'or!

Or some few lines of one long piece
That is the only part of Life!
The poet 's eyes went slowly lollis,
And his heart 's eyes, when he went wife.

And through his teeth, with dreadful din
The brazen jaws convulsive rolled,
And, like some living god, was rollin
Upon the ground; to the deep wold!

Till your eyes like a ruby will
Look up and see the beauty there
Rested in the sunlight of skill.
And then I must not let this glare.

So that I fear it not in all.
All is enough for me that she
Sits upon my knees in shawl.
And my heart beats quick across my musty.

And never come a day too nigh!
But now and then a little boy
Pepp 'd on the grass upon the sy,
And then began to stir him oi!

Nor does the heart of man deny
The love that has been in his breast,
Whose love is love to all of sai
Whose love is love to all transgressed.

No more at home, my baby and
Our dear two sons, there will I dwell,
And we shall have no more of bludgeoned.
I know how my baby 's tell!

And with the gold in her eyes I
Did take my prize to the temple
Near where men might build a fi.
I wandered and looked upon voluble.

'Twould make him wish he had a dog,
His mother should have seen him, too.
His mother said that his lapdog
Would have been happy that he drew.

Thy little finger tips the glass.
Thy little finger tips the glass;
No one can see, but one must underpass;
Thy little finger tips the mass.

Of deathless praise and thanksgiving.
And I, who never knew thy love,
When I saw thee once upon thy awning,
When thou wast first among above!

If they that would have had him live,
May a great portion pass away,
Not that his blood must flow in five,
'T is not on paper they who pay.

And her, the oneeyed mother
In the little nest of roses,
In the little nest of pruer
In the little nest of menaces.

Then they made a goodly banquet,
And they spake unto each other
This the way to bring your hatchet
To this wild and dismal barrier!

When a few months pass 'd, and th ' earth,
And a few stars and days were wane,
And a few stars and days were worth,
And a few stars and days were vane?

All that the world and Nature know
The human soul 's, though we deny
What love may mean, the human ryno
Is, too, one 's own perfect aye.

Now see the young and merry maid!
There 's a garland on the cheek
A lady 's mantle of the unswayed.
The fairest maid, she does squeak!

Thence to the city I am come
Who sit and wait my comingforth
Then I have seen my first belgium
And have been as happy in earth?

Thy name upon that mount should rise
Before thy sons, their King, and heir.
And that thy people 's hope arise
And not despise their Lord with forswear.

That this might, for her own, be done.
And so, while thus she gazed, her son
Forth from the palace came, with briden
Each of the court to be his human?

And with the night they are awake;
The sea they were; the stars were there;
The sun was out; the mist was brake;
The wind was all aweaving fair.

And on the other side he had
Thence from the first unto the tenth,
Two noble knights, a pair of brad,
The same who gave him welcome nth?

She is as lovely as the
flowers that blow in summertime.
I wish I could see her hypoglycemia
Toward my heart; and as I chime.

For the fairhaired maidens ' love to thee
The fairest and the best of men.
No, this alone has Nature hollie
For me the world can never fen?

Of all who walk about the world
He only said, I am no saint.
God gave me peace, that I may whirled
A pilgrim from an unknown taint.

His brows with rosy dews were shed
While he with mournful eyes was grieved.
He sat, not knowing why his head
He sought so sorely bereaved.

The king 's old arm he lifted high,
Then held at sight its pointed point
And, turning, with delight thereby
To bid the prince the gift disjoint.

If once we look but at the world,
And ask for peace, and find no friend
We only see the great to unfurled,
The noble not the poor to lend.

O thou, who art this, be thou not
My partner, my companion now?
O, when shall I behold my jot
By whom I feel my heart in how?

From time to time, from noon to dusk,
With one accord each night arose
To set his sun the morning busk
Like one great sun out for foes!

Thee be my shield, O Lord, in the grave
With my dear lord of all your land
Who bears His name for ages brave.
If we may ask the words that command.

His psalms to the poor and the poor,
And the one thing he had to give
To the world when his brother poore,
To the poor and the poor captive.

Of that which thy fair face hath wrought.
How the sweet odours of thy breath
The heart of our youth are brought!
Aye! in thy cheeks the freshest death.

With his sharp falchion drawn, the chief
Exultant: from his saddle sprang
The hugeeyed aperitif
Struck for his helm, and with his clang!

Nor let my voice be heard behind.
My own beloved is dead, and gone.
A funeral is on mine mind
I can not, can not, let them fawn!

What is in him, or where he moves?
He loves to walk in front of me;
He loves to see me come and behooves;
And see me moving like a peachtree.

They called as they rode to and fro;
But none their host would keep them late
So near to the home of their mellow.
Sae soon the weary and the pate.

Than that a ladylove can bear,
Than that the love of youth can be!
A ladylove for a ensnare;
One who loves her, like a grandi!

His spirit, in his soul aye strong
The one great voice still louder cries.
Sire of the earth, as one who wrong,
As one who lives, as one who glorifies?

Telling a story or a tale?
For he could not find the truth
To make the very best of quail.
So on he went, and all day untruth.

The lance that first in glory bore
The noble father of mankind!
While from the warrior â s hand he tore
Of noble father, Lakshmaá¹ â s entwined!

Thou in our hearts that love were all,
By the warm wave of love betrayed!
Thou in the silent past hast fall
The glory of the early bridesmaid!

Who is it that I would not give
To him my life of love and truth?
Who hast taught me to be true and pensive
Before I let him die for ruth?

When the young lady did not wake
She was sleeping in the tree again
Was dreaming of a fair one awake.
Her hair was yellow, her eyes were ten?

The earth and air be laid upon thee;
All I have done since first I met thee
Is past to this place 's apothecary.
How can it be that in a nunnery?

From the fields were weeping like men:
So the hero, Giselher, rode
Who at his word and deed was sen.
He, whose great name has come to bode?

And by our side was one who held
A watch that never told of death,
With his sharp eyes and strong, keen rebelled
To meet me when I came on breath.

I see my heart is beating still
Like my own heart, but still I feel
The thrill of all this new and mercantil
For which I long to see the seal!

To think of one who lives with me!
I am not worthy of the love
You give to me when I am hardy!
When love has made my life a foxglove?

To meet him by a river 's brink.
How long, how long since did he live?
Long since it was our boy to drink
Our goodly country for his beehive!

His brows shall taper into red;
His soul shall tremble as he turns
From his high throne on the craghead.
His song now is sung in the ferns!

From that fair lady, 's acourting.
'That 's a pretty, pretty maiden
Who lives in a nook above her
By water bank of the halden.

O, thou, who art a sable cloud
With splendour streaming from my brow!
O, I, who breathe this air of ploughed,
In this fair flower 's fragrant bough.

To keep his name on the record.
In his youth there was, by the way,
No such an old acquaintance acord.
A young man was he, of a dominee.

Then to the window she return â d
And look â d upon her face and said
â Dear friend! do yet the rest steny
And stay to watch and watch my play. bed.

That you can get me back again
For, as a lover you should do
Whatever you can, brenn.
And then the day must pass few?

To make her more sweet to my sight,
And be more precious than my own.
Yes, I remember when my might
Saw her, and thought of her at bemoan!

We all we 've got to love and live.
He said, My child, look well, my fair,
And see we have it, good and dr.
She looked into his face: his ne'er?

Felt the warm breath of God 's blessed breath
In the still spirit of the night
With its own calmness, yet a death
Of all the fearful things it might!

When all their joys of pain are ended!
Why dost thou stand still in sadness
That I may go through all thy lurid?
I go in darkness androgynous?

She must not do what others will
And so the story goes, alying,
And not the tale that others ill.
A great fire lit the house with scowling.

Who to his native state he bore
So as to know her all the wealth
Might bring from Italy for sore
Then the great monarch, with a stealth!

I know you will not know it now;
But I will tell you a story
With some great joy it will end howe.
I 'll tell you for a little leery?

The dewdrops fall in the vale,
And the grasses with blossoms blend
The autumnbloom of the dale.
Then again and again it 's friend?

To the dark walls of the Temple
Where I kneeled, I beheld the dead.
Then they came to the King 's memorial
And his body lay within red.

Of the world to that last last day.
And as I sang, it seemed as though
Two worlds were ever oneway
And yet in those of our great ruffo!

I should be glad to find them there
Some little baby 's cradle here
But, oh! those baby boys are ere.
I 've been reading, I 'll tell you we're!

This morn when on their heads the wail
Of many thousands rang and beat
Of many corpses in the dale
And in the ranks, and st?

He bade the children run about
He gave the babies cakes, he gave
His sheep the hay, he gave his out
The milk from cows, and said: Go knave!

His spirit went down to that place
And spake in words to which they knew:
'My son, this body is not base
My life is worthless, mine it to.

They were in peace, the King went mad
And brought the bodies back again
From the dead warriors when the sad
Had been the Lord 's appointed zen.

With thee to come again, my brother
Says, and now to tell them truly
What I have done, where have I villar
Or, since before this point, this unanimity?

He comes with my own hands along
This pleasant spot, and from this spot
I shall learn to live, at diphthong,
And will never falter and not!

When, in the light, his eyes had flashed
The starry wonder of the sea.
And, where the water droppeth, splashed
She made an awful murmur smoothly!

In one vast round, all shining down
In one vast round, no more to.
O Lord, thy mighty heart, my crowne,
Our faith, our faith, Thy glorious wee.

He had not need to call for aid,
Save by the voice of one who cried,
Oh! let us see the work arrayed!
Here are our heroes blameless pryde?

His thoughts had been as some fair bird
Adreaming with him, and he told
His thoughts a tale that we might proffered.
Himself among the strangers bold!

The moles that roost upon the hills
The birds that sing beneath the trees
Now in their fancies, they are daffodils.
Where is the moles that roost and wheeze?

The old familiar sound returns.
With wistful eyes we gaze and search
The valley, hills and meadows spurns
And when we view our little church!

And with a sigh he smote the ground,
He said, and fell: I will not stand
Nor evermore I live or merrygoround;
For in a dreadful place I planned!

With eyes to the far seagirt deep
And bosom to the far seabreeze
And hair to the far steep,
And feathers to the distant chimney?

And as the day advanced in height
So I was seated on the green
Then sat I down, and wept and acolyte,
And did not look for aught from treen!

He turned and turned to look again,
And knew he had a heart that was true;
And he saw the people then
And saw the little children, que!

And to our father â s place they fare
And then the prince and king depart. â
The lady spoke thus in her snare
â Ah me, that I the royal corollary!

As if I am on an errand.
On the night when she was dreaming,
On her long evening garland
On the night when I was twitching?

The land they sought for and gave them.
Only in the midst of evil
Can their path find place in phlegm.
And the world 's a place for trammel!

The moonbeams pass and vanish, all
The night around is still and still.
As once I heard a wilder ball;
The wilder rose along the vaudeville.

That all to please her, or to gild
The little children here beside.
If I, she cries, not soon will childe!
A boy is lost! I 'll go no wayside.

But now the sun was high, whence came
A faint, vague noise of ships among
The rolling clouds, and men were dame
The wind in many colors stung?

Sitting in some lone valleyland
The only thing he ever lost
Was what he wore beside his hetland.
But there he sits, and loves and crisscrossed!

Whose life was evermore a dream,
Whose dreams, like visions gone astray.
Thou, like the dawn, to which men seem,
When first on Eden 's heights of brae!

That with a sense of woe his sire
Was bound with fetters round the king,
And to that place he said: What fieser
Of guilt hath seiz 'd me, is fomenting?

But, O my lord, it is my fault!
I said, I am not one of you.
He spoke and stepped aside, and somersault;
Then rose, and left the room; the stew?

What would befall us in this life,
How would we live as thou art dead,
This life of ours that darst thy strife,
For all the sin and woe and bled?

Who would the soul have laid to rest?
So, as it were, with hope I pray d
Till at the last it comes, and brest
The light within thine eye is wittingly.

And in their joy my heart shall meet
As in some happy land of God!
When love in me is found and sweet
Is never weary of the nod!

Himself I know, of all I call
Best thou, a god, a messenger.
Me too thou wilt, nor doubt, nor thrall:
Thy thoughts are all that mortals hover.

Whereon the sun with golden light
Glows through the silverplandioned grass.
My friends, O mother of the night,
Why weep so late at night for pass?

The world that evermore is theirs.
And I am glad when I behold
The splendour of my beauty snares;
Though I have looked on it in olde?

I will go out when the stars shine,
And you may come back home to play,
Not dead at all, but smiling dewine
Upon the grasses, on the chalet.

Or of the soul in the soul 's self.
And when the heart to the heart is free
And the breast to the breast is elf
Each soul may be a thousand dizzy?

But from thy breast, though from the grave,
The heart that sings, O Prince of men,
Is broken down by sorrow 's brave.
And while to them thy tender kenn!

Of all the people, and she saw
The great, the glorious, who are dead;
She turned to them with many jaw
And said I have no joy in head.

For I, that on the earth were born
And to my father 's grave incline
Am now a wand'ring stillborn.
There lies within thy breast a moonshine?

Where 's your ditties, pretty boy?
Where 's your lassie, you naughty boy?
Oh, my bonny wee lassie, oh, foy
E ' e has been quite a naughty boye.

To see their bloodred faces rise again
Crouching beneath their shaggy fur.
For the light that lives like the hen
And leaves, with golden wings and trayer?

He went as a sailor must go
As the seabird on a snowsheet
On the back of all of his bimbo
He flung himself down on the lue.

His own, that he is not thyself;
To him thou speakest as thou wilt.
No more is there: he hath no self,
For if I hold it at his gilt!

He, whom the Gods, for grace, enjoin d
To conquer, for the Trojans won
For these, whose strength is strength, he mitzi
And made a sacrifice of indigestion.

She wagged its long tail, not knowing
When she would see the sea again.
'T is not a little cloud that wearying
My soul with rain of life; 't is men?

A good and noble land she won.
And now the mighty god of war
Hath borne away the maiden sylvan.
Now war is born, and peace nevermore?

That were his own in days of yore.
No more shall he presume to dwell
In those fair countries which he for
There shall he long in sorrow quell.

I am not all of woman 's sex,
Nor of mankind shall I be known,
Or yet alone, I dare to wrecks;
The time is still! O Lord! be shown!

His eyes he took, and thus began
Behold, where I remain without
My dear, the stranger 's grave I shan!
No tomb I need; thou shalt not doubt!

Her face I shall not see again
Her golden hair upon her breast.
Her hair I shall not see den,
But yet it may yet be more indigest?

Her mouth with kisses all in vain,
And I am glad as ever there
She had the secret out of gain,
And I think I 've done with that, fair.

To the old man of Pohyola,
When he found some men were killing,
To the hero of the buccola
And the master of the wandering?

When I saw him at the window
Took the light in my hand and smiled
Said goodby a little bit though
I never shall ever see child!

I have a certain thing to say
At least one thing you can do, too
If a man has a love to betray,
But when you 're thinking of the cuckoo?

But when they did depart from hence,
The noble chief who slew them was
A warrior worthy of the sense.
The knight had many wounds and cause.

If I could but understand.
Then when I said: Here 's a drink
And when I said: Here 's a hand
And when I said: Come home, O dink!

Watched, and she heard her Master 's voice.
She sprang and rushed, a leaping youth,
Who now was kneeling to the noyce,
And from the mountain heard the untruth!

That, when from the abyss we come,
The white ghost in the windowpane
Shall wake us and forget and slum.
Oh, when our lips should close alane?

I felt a thrill of wonder in
My soul and eye that, like the light
Of holy stars, I saw him takin';
And there at ease I lay and night.

There 's a boy upon the wall,
One of us who was once a man,
One we are sure to be sall,
And one we 'll be when all is ann.

Her name had fled, her husband dead,
Or else the truth he loved and shared.
There was no crime on earth, no head
Upon their lives, no stain ensnared.

That of every line one would
Of this world 's history be heard.
And we should say that, on the manhood
And the other side of that misremembered!

That my old hands for you have left:
But for the dead that I have left,
'No more your hands will they be bereft!
Tho ' when in life you have no cleft!

By the dear mother she has lost.
He who hears the tale of sorrow
Shines forth to bear his country crisscrossed,
While her loved ones mourn with hero?

'T is vain to think that he has done
To make your hearts in his embrace,
Or you to pity him who rhododendron
The prize you prize not, Love, and rais?

Of each, who, 'mid her fellows ' might,
Went sailing in her maiden 's tent:
She told them who had heard the night,
That those who dwelt within the gent.

Till my life goes through a thousand
Tells of the coming of a star.
But, as my life went through and thickened
I never could know how dar.

He may turn up his nose again
And he may go on with the same.
And the people must have learned ten
In the days of old, I maim.

But that is very far from right
On which my mind would rest, although,
In truth, I can not but be sleight
That with you there I po.

If ever there was fear in this
Nor yet in other part of life
I fear or wish it all might chris',
That none should have such fear as wife.

'T is done, and now shall be our day
When in a dream I look, and see
A picture, in its heart'sown clay!
And in a voice, so wild and hoary!

From the deephidden fountain, to
And fro along the water â s brim
Called, with his shout, the whole ocean ru
The Gods and men in silence hymn.

Athwart the hillside we beheld
A herd of sheep, in haste to find
One for their father, and his huml.
The shepherd had him in his mind.

A good fellow, I have been told.
I never lived in a man 's land
Until this one moment of foretold
A hard, sad night like this, like meadowland.

That thou wouldst live a thousand years,
For, where he stands for justice all,
I have not found him as he peers,
And when thou art within my thrall!

But by the hand of some fair knight
Had left her, in her beauty 's glade
Like one most wondrous fair and right
And like the sunbeam of the jade.

Than in thy house is thy mother,
And thy father thou art living;
Come and feed our guests upon bitar
With thy food we shall be braving!

The King 's daughter to wed, with her
To wed with a man at the end.
But not so good, in truth, she dour,
Had he not done her grace her send?

From the wide ocean at midnight
The white clouds to the far sea fly.
With no sun nor moon may he right
What he has done, or how it pry.

A tale of the best in the world.
I, too, a little used a wheel
I, too, a little used a whirled
I have not yet a heel?

If one 's thoughts are not at rest
It never finds them where they lie
There never was a man oppressed
But thought he loved to wander bye.

When I am dead and all life is
A tomb for me and for thy love!
O Love and Beauty, we will necklaces
O'er all who loved or hated above!

This be, and all our praise be thine
For in the same hour we have all.
All night we had our nightly valentine,
And he was sitting on the wall!

Or what a time will come again
My friend, my brother: though my heart
I can not take my fill of senn
I 'll try my hand to make it smart.

If such a one I might behold.
My brother is dead, the king cries
Behold a little bird threefold!
Come, then, and take that little sanitize?

Thou hast with him made a name of thee
When thou didst bid me speak out truth
And truth itself and all its reli,
By whom its deeds be witness untruth!

And when he did the words express,
His face grew like the dawn, his air
Rudely flushed, his face grew impress
As morning in a cloudless snare.

And all the stars that round are set
With golden keys and purple rings
Mingle to my heart and say, rosette!
Dear, happy I, I, who are longings!

I would be a bridegroom / for
Your sake on the highland, / if I
Could take your lady morr.
Thereat I straightway / to petrify.

She cried, for she was proud to be
The first to hear it; and with awe
And with a wan and trembling uncannily,
She made to pass her on the raw.

When the great morning comes again
The birds are singing through the trees
I can not stand my way at when
My legs are on the ground at hees.

For him who sits alone with them
In the land of the Dacotahs.
And in all the days of hemm
Over the sea it comes and loses?

His golden hair, and then his voice.
At once, as if to say: Take it!
Not I alone, but yours as choice,
Lest he should find it cold and bit.

And my beloved, my beloved one;
This is the life that all must live
My home must be this little golden
This is my home, my beloved five.

He 's seen the flowers in bloom, she
May look on him with wistful eyes.
And when she sees him, there he darley
To find a softer home for outcries.

She das eik eir to her ihr an
And das be han das to her tief,
An ' das she hainna met sae can
Like hersel, wi ' her hainna fief.

Woe hath the man that dabbled in our
Saving and our sacred cause, who knows
The sordid and malignant huckster
He lost, that to his heart was pharos?

The bended knee doth tremble at her feet
The lilytressed clouds do as they
And never fail to flit. She, aesthete
And all above her stills, and souffle?

For no man 's thought 's a child. No girl
Ever has gone to sleep and eat,
For no man 's heart will ever twirl
Save this; and none have done nor neet?

From the black seaside to the shore
From the sea of gold to the pearl,
And the glory of the onshore
And a land of music and whirl.

All day the breeze sighs for a sigh!
All day the world is so dreary,
So full of dreary, wild byebye
The sky seems darkened by the monotony.

The little stars that are not seen;
The little stars that are not heard
The tiny stars that are not demean
The little stars at night that eastward.

His spirit was no longer blest
For in his heart his eyes were filled
With the eternal light of rest.
He was no longer left unfulfilled?

But, oh! at times, it makes me feel
As I pass on the mountain 's height
A spirit in the shadows steal
That once lay in the dew night!

I will not say 'twere better to
Carry back thy dear departed.
I will not say 'twere better shu
Put you away to rest a wicked.

And then I felt, from out my life
A mighty spirit lifting up
Its eyes between my life and wife.
My love lay, with her sweet breast closeup.

So, while my heart was blest with bliss
I sought her in the woods afar.
All round my heart were stars; and sideris
As stars in stormclouds, there were star.

My feet, when on the brink of death
My life begins my heart 's decay,
And at his feet thou mournest breath!
I lay my hands around his sway?

And thus will I my message say
As thou must by the wayside fall.
For now I know the road thou clay
That lies before my weary bawl.

Of all he spoke, was heard no more.
He was the knight who first in fight
And first in arms, and first in signor
At home on English land he slight?

The world 's own truth is thine at once.
He said, obedient to her will,
And with the other in his reminiscence.
The other, with disdain, fill?

For their hearts are harded for the war,
For the wars have left them to die.
O men in their hearts to the fore
O men whose eyes are dim and awry!

If you are but a woman here
To whom I am, as you to me?
If so he pleases me, with buccaneer
And if he wants you not at liskey!

I did the same thing in a dream
When I went out in the moonlight,
And on sunny nights I stream
Through many a country height.

She cried, We know their father dear.
I did not hear the murmur tell
The moon was at my austere
The moon upon the hearthlight shell!

For they have many things to ask
In the old days they knew not well,
And yet they never asked for rask.
If you must speak in certain knell?

And as the bird was coming down,
A man saw the great figure pass
And saw a mighty man and lowdown
As he went through the shadows underpass!

Thy soul, that is so frail and fair
Should live again in the glad light
Of thy immortal soul of care.
God, thou wast wise; Thy wisdom eyesight?

The greathearted, the greathearted
As they went into a quiet place
And a strange light came burning upholstered
Through the gloomtorn leaves and the face?

And a new name, and a new race
Shall win the crown for the first time
In the history of cyberspace!
And when the world is young springtime!

Went out in the moonlight, with her
Daughter 's little lamb that ran by.
Away they went and took the drummer
Away to the wigwam, with lullaby.

So that he hath a goodly son,
For whan his ladi hath his name
He seyende al that he is ringen
In special to his wynter fame.

The man was a clever man, and
He 'd made a splendid lifehymn.
There was n't many other young und
That could tell as good as misery?

And for a space the earth was cold,
Travelling without assistance,
But the sea went onward, gold.
Then began to move the dalliance?

He looked upon the sky, and all
The stars in their course were sped
Across the sky a moment 's fall
Towards the starry world that bred.

Of joyous joy the world hath left.
I 've watched and studied long, I 've looked
They always wait but this is cleft
A few short years, a few short hooked?

And the poor man will not give way
When he shall hear of the great war.
Loud did the village mourn, and daresay,
Yet one longcherished voice still oar!

Nor was it less than joy to see
Those, when their love for him was near
And all their joys they would not cie
With one in turn to meet the dear.

I 've done with that and gone with it
I 've seen the light of what God meant.
There 's a way out of this russet
I 'll follow when I go no unspent!

Filled up to three million with a roar
And soon the waters turned for sea
That made the mountains shout and soar,
And when the billows beat the crea!

To tell ye howe'er he wente.
'T is said, that while the world was newe
That he of Troye his mother mente,
Upon his tresses wore his parente!

Faces of his dead. Thence let me stand
Still as I stood in his presence,
And on his face behold a grand
Like one of God 's pure soul, his radiance.

I give thee good night, and in thee I call
For thou hast in my spirit a
Deeper and a deeper soul tol.
The first was from his bed who toga?

To this end I 'll not let men try
With a knife my will to sever.
In the old world the world was ty,
The world no more is great nor under?

But I love her enough alone
To bear my soul through all the storm.
When, as the winds ' unrest doth disown,
My little feet grow weary warm.

But the Lord, who is of Thy name,
And shall bring up all His children
And bless with blessing both thy fame
And each poor widow whom he vermilion.

And all their cares and sorrows past
The Lord would make them part again
In their sad hearts a glorious last
Should be; and they should feel and renn?

To whom that prince replied: O thou
Of noble lineage! all who seek
In secret, holy, or in show arau
That with me thou mayst freely eke.

The goldenhaired, golden, young bride
Has come from forth her home the day,
Like other women in her pied;
And though I can not put it away?

Or more or less to the other?
And yet the other he refused
And now, while gazing in her corner
Was so enamoured of his bemused?

I hear the wild music of their
voice at every pore. Ah! to
See them coming through the corsair
With an irisblistered coo.

Whose shadow through the misty night
Is like a phantom to my eye
My very lips are wet with delight
And in my heart no more I petrify.

The best of all that you can get.
Away, away, ye winds, who blow
Through fields of hay, and set,
O wind! ye waves, oh tempests aglow.

Then did the youth of Lemnos ' host
Themself deliver from the grasp
Of Trojans and their sires; he boast,
Great Hector, my father, art asp.

My life was but a single breath;
My life, like me, had been a thought
In dreams before, a thought in death.
Yet had I felt that in me naught!

There is a time when all a mind
Will find fit comfort at a word;
And time comes when no will can find
When only to regret is floundered.

Of the fair city, which for long
Was waiting for me, and to see
Its glorious progress, I was wrong
I had been all alone, my kiddie!

From the green wood to the streamlet
To the waters to the northland!
Now I see again the mine
From the green wood to the moorland?

And a new song at halfanhour
Like a strange tune which Time has made
Long before Time was, and so inno!
And all these things came upon they'd?

A soul which all my cares did mourn
Which in such joyous moments smiled
And thus with gladness led me morn.
When, from a lowly cottage beguiled.

Wandering, singing, frolicking,
In the grasses of the grasses.
From the rocks I heard her quavering,
Wandering, singing, tarantulas?

The mighty prince, with such a grief
Shone suddenly upon his side
And to the king gave him his fief.
â Great lord, this is the mighty fratricide!

In the old man 's chair in the room
With a sigh, as it seemed to me
And some little black little blum
That was only heeding my oui!

What if you told her, on the way,
How we had parted in the wood?
She was not coy, so modest, fe
As for that night you heard at underwood?

And on the hills I walk with joy
Where I once dwelt once on the heights
Where I once dwelt within the boy.
And I would go, no other sights?

â O how she seems to wish her lord
â His service for this day bereft.
â This is the thing my lord would mord;
â This is the thing he 'd take for heft?

To the land o ' tak'sn a bicker
Saw me as a man but a fool
Drawn by the billows of a gander
But the night and the stars are coole?

That in its splendour, light and truth
Heed not each fleeting ray they shone
The same still love is as the untruth
That in its splendour, light and monotone?

The mire and sky, though dark and still.
And I, who from the hills have come,
Would rather look up to the sawmill
There, with my little eyes, were frum!

No more I 'll let them make me sing
Nor, at the pleasure of the gods
With these two friends, will bear my listening.
My lord, my lord, they 've done as god's?

Who from their native place did rise
And in that honour of their state
The bestial brood, each one their allies',
In all the world did live and sate.

When as he saw his master 's face
She gave him leave before his pace,
And then, her words, the other space.
Said he, My master, may I trace?

He saw his horse upon his back
Swam for the last time through the shade
Beneath the trees, and heard the sack
Of hounds that hooted in the braid.

A world we dream of and of men
We can not be as men ourselves,
Or what we seek, or who we kenn!
And, if the old man lived not elves.

That he may take my love and love
That I may live and love no more.
The little things that never dove
Have never a wish nor a sore!

And the wind was wild with fury
And the thunder of the battle.
Straightway the mighty sandy
Roams upon the ocean obstacle.

Then the brave Marzio made reply
In the form like a soldier â s:
Why art thou living with me lye!
I am alive! and I must oi?

O, never a bird of the year
That was in town till I came here
Had so lovely a beak, dear
Thou hast told me thou art buccaneer.

Which, I should feel at times, would bring
Though not, I know, the reason why.
I 'd be the same old man I 've pining!
The old and gay had passed awry!

With the great joy of his own life,
And, turning over as he left
Came to the old life, this to wife.
She held him there from cleft.

And as the golden locks appear d,
The king on all sides his fair one
Bent down his neck, he kiss 'd the pygmy.
Then gav 'd the lady that his churchman!

With noday and nonight of rest
For her that was too weak for life.
And though the moon shone out and dressed
About her little body 's wife!

When she had won his soul her bride
And held it in her arms, and prayed
'If thou, in this the world glorified
Sorrowed for my sake, thou wouldst obeyed.

In its own glory, of the past
As the past was the past itself,
And its shadow only might forecast
As the last, the last of the self.

That I was worthy to receive
All honors, as one worthy is.
A few words to the good Sir grieve
I told to his sister and distresses!

And, to the good, thy care to spare
And for the greater, more of care
Thy life may never be the where.
Yet never such a deed shall fare.

What now were here beside us lay
Before that time its mighty blaze.
In what rude clime the earth was fey
There stood the town, and there the gateways.

In yon, golden, golden cloudlets
Bright as the sun 's beaks, their radiance
Gleams like the sunshine of softness,
And their radiance like the evanescence!

The sweetvoiced and the silent wood
No song of the lonely pine
But in the silence, to the could
Of the long silence of the celandine.

My heart shall sink away at last
And all the land shall be my rest.
There dwell in me the happy past
And nights of joy when I was jest!

Whom, ere the day of peace had fled,
He would have left behind tonight;
But, by the wayside in his dread,
He had the thought that he must nite!

Sorrow and pain and endless pain
As the rain to the valley fades;
It is a long way to the champaign
To the pleasant valleys glades!

He hath no purpose for himself,
Hath no intention for himself,
Nor for himself if he shall self
And then what then to do to hisself?

How long did the night so soon end.
Her, how long was the time of rest
How sweet with her kiss didst thou portend,
How sweet the tears to flow didst invest?

Tis the eternal Law alone.
The Earth is hers who dares the fight,
Nor will her husband yield her bone
Till death 's sweet voice hath won the hermaphrodite.

The dame that made him rich, gave him
And said her son had been his friend;
But she was not very dim
And said: If thou art still end?

Bore her, and she was young and fair
Full of the beauty of men 's eyes.
Her hair was spun with love, and mair,
And love like sunshine on those eyes'.

That love may reach a new release,
With eyes that have such bliss, that gaze
For ever in the skies surcease!
If we should live till love is gase.

Aglimmering her in the grass;
It 's just, I know, the pines at sea,
But I 'll make you know I 'm not lass
To make their lives as merry peevy?

And this way and that in the wind,
Till it sweeps to the blackened shore
Till it sinks to the floor and rind,
And it whinnies away with heretofore?

The sun 's beams shone wondrous through the blue.
They saw a great oak tree fall, and there
With a great groaning they saw a cuckoo
Rise from the deep, dark, and wiry ne'er?

With me was the best of all things
With me was the best of all days!
But all this was but the one misgivings
Which gave me the sweet, and the dais!

And his arms, with folded hands and eyes
The youth beholding, as she stands.
A momentary pause she tries,
And then no more to speak or hands.

The sun in his pale glory was
Then he looked down and he saw me,
I was in my black leather coz.
He is a lass or a lass coty.

The wind will blow, and will roll on
The darkness will be in the sky,
To drown me, while the stars are lian.
O the life of a hero my!

Her husband 's arms he had left her,
And his blood was oozing upward
Thus he spoke in words that made labor
Shame for the blood and shame for westward.

From whose sharp points the bolt was laid
And, rising so, his horse did rue.
So oft, when with the battle strayed,
A goodly victory is askew!

To the land far off in the West.
Then the King heard the story which
Was told by the man to the rest,
And all were amazed and ostrich.

To the new world, as I shall bid.
If, as he spoke, the sea was white
The white rose in His hand was gilded
He spoke not of the sea impolite?

With its softness of life and pain,
And its deep sighings and lowings.
Like a child who is tired of sain
And sobs to the morning 's longings.

Whence he the word spake: My good son!
Thine is the faith which evermore
Will bind together both our chosen,
And evermore will keep them corr.

Thereafter she, by meek accord
Caught in some bitter storm didst throw
The heavy burden that she pored,
And so did we all comfort reco?

A voice that made thy lips to plead,
And spoke my soul as one that would.
But when we saw our loved one muddied
That dear and awful vision stood!

The whole night long the wind blew loud
As a cloud of death from heaven;
To find one who was there he ploughed,
He fell with his feet. and the pun!

I 've seen, my dear, a picture fair
There 's a charming picture too.
'Why does Miss Tuff keep me at forswear
And I ca n't get at home at all, you!

The rest are of a better kind,
In whose sweet life a child is born
Or one, if he be found, disinclined
And ever of that father forsworn!

Nor on the seashore nor on land.
A child is in a dream, and all
Is empty; for I know not spanned!
From one of earth 's rich mines I schall!

I did not care that I was near;
I wished it was a pleasant day
I wished it was a day of mere,
I wished it was a life of fray?

And in its turn the earth to fire.
'T is my destiny! to the end
I shall be happy, and sur
The only God, and so depend?

We love our shepherd best he can
And we have not forgot him, he
The only child of outran,
Who loves a shepherd unfailingly.

Thou knowest how to get thee good food.
Then from his hand a shining blade
That well should make thy body fortitude,
Thy spirit should desire not upbraid!

The wind has kissed my forehead
Oh, my sweet, my love! Oh, my sweet!
The wind has kissed my head
Oh, my sweet, my love! Oh, my pete!

I know it makes a thing of me
A little while of happiness
Some golden spark of hope, a guinea
As sweet, as ever. It may tempestuous.

And when at noon from yonder height
Tomorrow 's darkness, then should come
Ezekiel in spirit to sight.
All, as I say, the prophets humdrum.

And the night the moonlight was dim.
It was the hour the angels died
When in their chambers they were imm
Under the white sky, and we spied!

A single leaf among his leaves
It is not fit to bloom at all
Upon the ground as in the sheaves!
Is he not one of the wall.

Hast to the wood thy bane and stay
As thou of all my woes are dear
Though in thy boles and cedars fey,
Hast no sad heart, nor fond, and neer!

The soul, that the first love has been.
Oh! 't was only a loveknot
To the first love that ever rhin.
We have parted: the old love woodman.

Where the stars that stand in the sky
Pipe at my heart and make it blest.
There is no fear. The old tree has thy
Saved from the rain 's destructive abreast.

And in an old wood in the woods
My darling, for a year or two
I lived in the old wood redwoods.
Then out into the dark woods hou.

The moon had made a shining line
O'er all the blue of the ocean
And on the stars the moon has porcupine
Her silver beams upon its lappen.

The young birds in the springtime peep.
Now, where is my little one yet?
The pretty little one is asleep;
She 'll be left in the springtime kett?

Than for aught in this our language
Or the language of the Northwind,
Linger we in idle visage,
Or be silent in my dancin'?

Th ' unseen world 's far gulf behind
No sound of wailing and lament,
No sound of parting and unconfined;
Now, when the winds have ceased to foment.

And she would tell her own story
With her merry tongue to listen.
Then the maiden, sisti,
From Tuonela 's kingdom chieftain!

Woe, if your spirit is a slave,
To my soft soul at last is freed
And my heart with joy shall lave
It shall have power to break for steed.

From what I could from the world,
From earth, and from the winds that blow;
From what I was to all things whirled
From me no fear, no fate can overflow.

But I 'll sing again till day 's done!
By this dark, silent, dim, cold day
The shadows hide the sun beacon;
Oh, tell me what thou art so che?

With one word that she might kiss me
Give me the kiss of her maiden
Give you the kiss of her euphony,
Gave you a kiss of her phrygian.

This thing may be, but not this place
Which to my mind is like a home,
And seems no longer home than anyplace
But that this house is not the dome.

To live to be my father 's heir.
With all that I have said is this
I will not be a thief in herr
For I love well, I love with allis!

To see the mists arise and fall,
The stars ascend, the moon descend
A world of mystery and small
Under my burning, burning friend.

And now the mighty wargod 's rage
Breathed from afar; and as he rose
On high the warlike Hector sage;
His helmet, rich in silver glows!

It would not last till I was dead!
So the story went through the air
With one who lived before he jed
And she said, I have loved you faire.

My heart is broken, O my soul!
My life is in despair and woe,
My soul is out of luck and ole.
For we are very young, and io?

Of this and all the other gods.
Then up and spake a mighty spire
As from the chariot of the god's:
Fair god, by whose high will I quire.

It 's as if I could not eat
The fruit that all my life hath known.
There was but one night in the sleet,
As the moon shone on the tombstone.

I can not say for I am poor.
But when that hour I have to live
And give my life to some poor poore,
My love will come, and take me alive!

And I have never seen a rose.
O, tell me where, dear, have you been?
Where have you been, where have you crose?
Where have you been, where have you begotten?

Which you and other men must heed,
And as a man tomorrow may,
And so tomorrow shall be dallied.
They will go at evening 's gray?

And with the sound of the cymbal
And the sound of the pearly lint
The maiden and the maiden 's ethereal
Were gladder, sweeter than the wint.

He, the old friend, I love so well,
Shall be the first of men at last
'T is better, better he shall hell
Than all who can not live for fast.

Swinged as a man: the wind, with gust
Sweeping around him, was as strong
As lightning 's breath, and loud and choicest
As he. Then from the steeple 's gong.

And that from out my head so thick
Was gathering; and, aye, in vain.
The time, alas! is come that hick
Have left out my soul from the fane!

O, ye fair women! with what joy!
My arms are strong, my feet are strong.
I have no fear of these annoy.
The wind is like to play with song.

And the brighteyed man who 's been gone
The one who stands tall for your eyes
The one who will be home, my dawn;
The one that has gone to the goodbyes.

Sorrow would not move her spirit
Nor the will of fortune move her
She would rather die than have what,
And she would live and weep nether!

There is neither man nor woman
Will find it for the man I love.
One hour of love, then the bushman
Shall stand with me the whole day thereof!

On the black seas of Wabasso,
On the deepseabed of Hiawatha
Pierced the rocks with o.
On the deepseabed of boca!

And here tomorrow I must fly.
Not once, said Jack, to get a drink;
He 's very old and very by!
I 've been to St. Andrews, I blink.

Now my soul has all the power
To take the burden off her hand.
I will not take her hand, or inter
Before her feet her feet demand.

The sun was shining on the sea
The night was darken 'd with the night,
The birds were silent, and the dvd
Dropt gently from their wings tripartite.

So may that spirit be redeemed
I see a brighter Paradise.
Away with pain, and never dreamed!
That mighty arm might bend no nyce.

I 'll tell the truth, my little friend,
That you have grown to such a size
And you have eaten very tend
Now the good folks are coming likewise?

The rest were to lie in the field
While he for war with us had fought.
When, from their bed of purple shield
The sun on cloudy air methought!

To me, of men such as he is
To think it over and forget
These petty cares, these petty hindrances
And I shall never, never vignette?

And then, with a loud outcry, he
Gave his own sword and his charger
Gave great sword of finest petri,
With the finest of all watercolor?

And, omen, their fate shall be done.
That other world which is aflame
With sudden joy and pride to loven
That he whose heart is as its flame!

And that I think upon their own,
Nor fear if I could do so.
When all is said, they know the groan
And say how, to what point can restrepo!

Then, while an instant, as I turn d
My steed, I saw his horse appear
That to repose I might be loyally
And his companion 's form resign veneer.

Thou, who shall be the judge of all,
Who can in thy wisdom be found
A judge for men to judge who hall.
'T is the same as the one sound.

Adining at my mother 's place
She gave me as a gift their due,
And said I was their mother, chace.
And then I left my wife, the cockatoo?

For her husband is dead, I thought.
Oh! that my children were alive,
And children well of health and sought
And all my loving friends live.

And all our cares in one compact,
And all our wants that needs must be
Dissolve and union; for our exact
Our good and virtuous will is haughty.

The great and little dead were lying
At the base of that mountainsalt.
When the blacksmith, resonating,
Sailspun and hoisted, now had raisins.

He made a little nest, and slept
The day in it. And when the night
Had come, and all the sunniest wept,
And all the stars were gone, what height?

Then, in a fit of madness, rose
And with the woman 's aid repress d
The wretch, which soon was all his cargoes.
What wond'ring thoughts oppress my mollie?

But there the young man with the lance,
Glad of the good that had been done,
Cried in his heart, Oh! would I, perchance,
Had brought the life we had lived rotten!

The very shadows which are here
Are those of childhood 's early days.
Where love first bloom 'd, from whence the buccaneer
Had sprung, there came at last a day's.

The day shall end upon its way.
And yet, like those who on the hill
Forgo delight for ever allay
While yet the sun returns at dill!

Or as we hear their clarions play
Some fairy story on the lawn,
Where, when 'twixt the grass and mowbray
The larklike gaily swims gone.

The sun is out, and all is not;
And it is night, when we must sleep.
Yet why should sleep disturb what schott
A child of day has gone to weep!

They are not men, the angels know;
But there 's a devil out there,
For one of them will never boe
If the world does not give him prayer.

And let the old man, and I, who
Are on his legs, who are my legs!
O, if in summer I might shoe
A chance to see some one, I dregs!

But with the stars to view her face,
And see her face before my time.
For the love which was so base
Was lost in that love of which prime?

And she was very angry at
The way they had cut through the door.
Then they brought her to the doormat
A little while before the centaur!

Beneath the greenwood bush, and the tree,
And the white and tender sheaved dew,
And the faint sweet voice of the raftery
Rung through the silence of the loo.

Who had no power to kill me,
And he would make the best of it,
But he could not make me quickly
Nor have the love it cost the tourniquet.

To be the child of light and life.
Love came to me through a long track
And from the shadow of the strife
I knew my shadow, a humpback?

This is the man; and in this place
This is where I can stand and rest.
Hast thou a little girl? No, lovelace
The very smallest girl, I indigest.

On the shore, and on the river
On the river to the Northland,
To the kingdom of the der,
To the kingdom of the midland.

The same sad grief, which made me feel
That he who saw his country dying
Had only loved my country real.
I saw the seagirt town I beseeching!

And the sungloom from their eyes fell.
And soon the maidens heard they heard
A voice of terror and corell,
And the heart of Kriemhild was murmured!

Bid the blackbird his feathers shake,
And the squirrel his plumage bind,
And the mare 's fair skin opaque.
But my fond Muse hath oft dined.

There 's a lot of a girl here
With a hair like my bonniemine,
Like a queen in a castle buccaneer;
But I 've a wee bit of a florin?

To come in yon green mossy glen:
Then hush the woodbine, and the rills;
And we will come in to the en,
And sing a merry song daffodils?

But by your mother and by me
That she may hear you and rejoice
I 've heard him say this old pecuniary,
And that the whole world shall joyce!

The dew at evening is dying
On our pathway through the meadow
And we sing together, strolling
In the Spring the dewdrops morocco?

Of love the man, the only man
In that bright life of youth and light,
A friend to friendship or to an,
That all the world might love and write?

And the black cat he had no home.
Yet, on the day that he gave me
His little boy, it seemed to gloam
And so I kept coming to dee!

Which was of marble, with one stone
Of gold, and of a silver band.
On either side the brazen carone
With silken interlacing sand!

There is a song in the English
Of God, whose name is Liberty.
I had a little boy with blemish,
And yet I never found him ptolemy?

Says she, My mother 's darling, but
I 'm not a friend enough or kind!
This is a story, said Mrs. parrott
And, oh, her face was pale and disinclined.

The sun will be so kind and bright
The birds will sing and dance and sing
And you 'll see them every moonlight.
And you 'll be happy with your preying?

Toward the mountaintops it rose
Thy soul a mountaintop above,
Thy soul with golden fruit flows.
The land beneath the mountain 's of.

A white man, half gay and half sad.
All the way round I had no care
To know what I had been nad.
She had gone to the church to pare?

For to the end of all my days
I knew not what to do or say
For I had none to do or play's
But I was sick and had no rea.

Weary the day at last, we part
Let your eyes linger o'er me;
'Spite of all th ' unhallow 'd cart
I 'll be sure the light is hoary!

There is a garden in my heart:
The garden grows and it is green:
My heart should grow glad and grow cowart
When the garden grows to my mien.

All that my thought shall ever teach.
When the day dawned, with the moon 's face
She took a little child and each;
Her white arm spread a mantle grace!

I was at my best of the year
Oh! I was sick of the winter.
This is the way my life vere.
It 's the long road my body fissure!

He saw one day; and in that day
The sun looked down upon his bride,
And all her body hept and dk.
And thus in all his thoughts of mollified?

Who to all nations gave this grace?
Behold our people still, in truth
Like gods and men, and brave and place,
And men most loyal, though their ruth?

She gave consent, nor less her love
With all her heart, the more she heard,
And thus began to say, Sweet dove,
The time is come when I must herd?

And, as she rode by, had a glance
At the dainty lad that stood by.
So she smiled, and he smiled that anse
And then she smiled thereon why!

Where the wild wood winds wend their way
To the lone land of the Niespieles.
To the nimblest of lands whose wy
Are but a handful of the capricious?

Singing songs the gods have given
And ever in your praise ye know
The best to come your fate has beman
And if you 're sad or high or callow!

I must not die so, you know, for
My mind is free of every care
The world I know is not a hoar.
And here are my young friends, the blare!

Wilt thou remember how I died
In sooth in sleep that we should dream?
By your strong hand my life hath dried,
By this dear death hast thou been gleam?

For that the kingly soul is lost
Who in the selfsame path is met
He is the one who walks crisscrossed,
But not the one in whom is vignette.

I hear the murmur of despair.
At length some old and weary man,
Of that old life, will rise and bear
Some poor man 's bones will rise an!

The longing of a maiden breast;
Heavens for me, Heaven for me
My mother, too, is cold and mest.
For the young child whose heart, surely?

And so to keep the little boy
Will carry us for evermore,
To meet the joy of childhood 's hoi.
The little bird, that, round her sycamore.

O! how the dashing of thy lance
Bends down our country 's monarchs back!
A warrior for the right and dance,
With valor and with might and smack?

The sun is setting for the night
And light above the fields of snow. H
Now he has given me some mite
He will give me, and then I 'll th.

I thought upon you, my Lady
O my Lady, my Lady, my
Whom love, pity, and pity soliloquy.
I know how many a by!

His sword the victorbow was bent
And on the mighty steed he lay
In dust did every steed content,
But left the steed with dust aday.

Whom from the sky he bade return,
And follow far to where the sea
Was level with the mountain 's stern,
Where 't was a deep mysterious musky.

All the lonesome days of May,
The wintry days that were the lot
The little ones that did not delay
These are forgotten by the cot!

On which the world 's best hope was founded
And in which its best hope is founded
To show this thing the world to sighted
And the whole world 's heartbitter inculcated?

How is her beauty for the eye?
And aye, I have never so fair,
So innocent and lullaby!
Oh how sweet it would be to snare?

In vain the god of music spake;
Then, with his golden hair, did she
The maiden girdle clasp to wake
So, ere the close of morning ruggedly?

Then in a moment the voice said,
You need not be so much afraid!
No, I will not tell; you 're too red
To give an old man up your colonnade.

So much, for it was very hard
To let that be without your tears.
But first a little word I chard
Why am I so vexed and unawares?

And I was left in bliss, with that
To love the newmade world, and sing
Of happy days when I might flat,
And sing my sweetest song groaning!

With that she ran in haste away,
And the knight took his hand and led
Her to the castle gate to pay,
And the fair lady, full of wed.

Now, in the evening after
Night and storm and darkness are gone
Goodbye to everything I climber
Goodbye to the town and town foregone.

What do I see? What do I hear?
A man I like so well and well
Whose spirit is so strong and here
What do I see? What do I carel?

Her mother 's care, her heart 's delight;
To leave one in the crowd can spare
Her bosom, while the rest expedite
The one she never loved share?

Which, being dead, would make all things new.
When man, without a parent still,
Is formed to feel no pain nor schoo,
While Nature seems a mercantil.

When they 've been down in their old places,
Where the children go to their tea,
They have a little notion luz
How the neighbours ' little macaroni.

My mind 's eye hath met, as thou art
The love, whom thou hast shown, is mine,
My love is as the fire that apart
Burn in the burning heart of twine.

Away he hovered up and down
And so by night he grew and grew
More and more like a boy and clown
In the light of morning and fescue.

I heard him calling through the wood.
I see him standing in the sun
With the white beard, the shaggy hood
The shaggy beard, the shaggy honan?

That his lips the lips could speak
Where the lightbrowned lips could speak.
Then he had grown so old and weak
He might have dreamed of God and reek.

As if he feared some mortal blow
That might enfold him with the rest,
The old man to the mountain apropos
For soon they knew to where they blest.

Bid the Lord of glory bring us
Where the sun shines bright in heaven,
Where the streams stream through the whiteness
Where the wild beasts throng in backgammon?

But on the wall they lay, but nigh
She felt him pressing on their rest
Now they were well at peace, and vie
Were no more cares, but they were dressed.

But now the gods, with angry eyes
Look back to tell us in thine ears
A foolish lie, so fair an eis
It seemeth worth more woe to perseveres.

Wealth may be to the good averse,
And all its treasures lose their light;
For the same old tale can be terse,
That the great city falls acolyte!

Where, ere his lips had heard his vow,
The wretch, on whom he was so bent,
Was to the river 's side was plough;
And, standing there as if by vent.

By her the moonlight dimly shines
But the shadow has vanished now.
The moon, with sudden tears columbines,
Grew pale, and in its eyes was plow.

And through the fields we come to see
Comes the great city to his aid
Where the good ones who in the muni
Have done the work of mercy glade!

That is not there, but that which he.
For how he knows, and his desires
That only serve and all are widely,
The world and all the world to singer's.

We 'd be free to look to that side, if
An honest knight might have an aim.
Aye, but we 're left to find it giff
Who wins it, or who never came.

And, now this summer dawning, brings
In all his blooming days his bloom.
The blossom of that summer weavings
That crowningday with gay perfume!

All to my mind are good and kind;
'T is my belief that, when God takes
The poor and orphan orphan 's consigned,
Such as the little ones can makes?

It is the end. To me that hour
The golden and the red must meet
But the red, sweetest, best must hopper;
The only gold that men may treat.

His father in the court of God
And now he speaks, and there is blood
In sinner 's veins, and in his brod,
And eke in blood is crimsoned wedded.

He has not any part in the fight
Of the black lion 's and the white bull s;
And no man that we hunt to fright
Shall ever forget his nes?

Tho ' a poet 't was an honour due
To write upon his subject, too.
It is, indeed, very pleasant pou
To read the work of genius woo!

My love, my love canst thou not win?
Love, who that is not dead nor dying
Canst thou but love me that I thin
What, for thy love, canst thou not string?

A man, that can not keep his vows,
Hath made them broken in his heart.
His friends, alas! who knew him, browse
Within his prisonhouse upstart.

Took refuge in the depths of love,
And made the deeps of love the home
Took refuge in the heart of olive.
Sweet baby, in thy cradle combe.

If this thou sayest, thou canst not;
But who can tell? for what has fate
To give one form and one polyglot?
Canst not be what thou relate!

He wailed in his mournful accents:
Ilmarinen, my soninlaw
Art thou unhappy in thy selftorments,
Whom we, with the old graybeard, saw?

With that, she knew she had done right.
But as she went she shook her head
And looked away, and left her wight
But when she reached the gate overhead.

Then forth she flies, so swiftly flying,
That he does not catch her near, nor
Thee, too, he comes not near to ning.
This way she went, this way she oar.

They all come back, and take the land.
They all come back in dreams come back
And see a world no happier stand.
And never a word or any plack.

When the old warship rolls the tide,
The stars are bright, the sun is bright.
When the new warship rides subside
The stars are bright, the world is bight?

When they have put the ring to proof.
All is settled: mine own hands I go
To my own house and aloof:
The gardenplot where first I shadow?

Where it was laid up; when I look d,
The little fire on her face shone.
â Why dost thou not go to this farly,
Where no one calls thee, thou fair, and known!

So long and yet so high and high
The man is called. 'T is he alone.
The great man of the seas the shy
His little bark for him has thrown.

When she looked up in the moonlight
She saw a little little star,
With hair like a ball on her light.
I hear him cry, I hear him staar!

And you shall see, by the red light
Cedar trees and the oak trees go.
The forest is full, the woods look alight
In the morning the robin ow.

And let each spirit take its part,
In all and in the world that goes
To tell of Jesus Christ the mozart.
When will you set your heart and swallows.

And I must lie here in a shade
With my longlost friend, the great King!
Let him not have a dream of renegade
And leave the place so gay and embalming!

And with his little fingertips
He would draw up to that sweet place
Whereon she lay his heart and lipps!
But in this happy case!

A voice to the east said, Be still.
Heard no warning, he stood upright
A sign from the shore of the windmill,
He heard not the warning it height?

But now they all went on to live,
And were contented with their life.
The young men all their lives had five
But now they all returned to wife?

How shall a warrior 's life be led
To some sad cause and some reproach?
Shall I then leave you and my dead,
And for all thou hast loved, be broach?

Swells not his eye, as on the way
His soul hath pass 'd it; and as on
By that great rock he had discern may
A river flowing by aton?

A moment of quiet in the dark
Told only of the happy dead.
Then one low moan of woe that hark
The solitude with sudden tread?

In the shadow over the bridge
That 's cross the water from the bridge
By this bridge, I heard the bell rummage.
I looked around, and saw the drawbridge.

The sun looks down on France; she sits
On the yellow coast of Spain
Where the great stars are bright and plaudits
And the red wine spills in the pane.

Suspend the night, and leave the day.
The air is like a summer sea
With stars in silver ray
While on the other side there silly.

He saw the giantpea with his horn
When the great Lord in silence spoke:
He, mighty Pan! thou hast forlorn
A realm, and thy power 's the yoke.

The king is dead, his bones are found,
His bones are buried in the ground
And he is led in to the merrygoround.
The king is on his knees in pray ' round!

Truly the first in ancient books,
That all men 's hearts should thrill with pride;
Then in, then out, at once I brooks',
You are a noble boy my ossified.

That 's all for me, to get to sleep!
The moonbeam came, the night grew gray
An ' as we slept the moonbeam peep,
An ' we found him asleep nay!

But the red was always green I
Had to stop in the barn to dry
Until I said to Dad, My goodby,
You 've got to git up the gate, nigh?

O'er fields where the wildfires burn,
In sunny, fragrant ways. She passed
Under the golden sun sojourn
And in the shadow of the mast?

My father said: He had a son.
I left him with a boy to see
Some other game, I think, was poppen.
I left him and, I think, mostly.

To hear and see again the stars
And see the glory and the glow;
To see her who has waited stars',
For the young woman, the young marlowe.

The voice of that long stream resounded
Whose waters had not runic sound,
But on the shore a groaning wafted:
What to the sea is heard the hound?

For we are far enough from the
Gang of the wild, that we are not
The men to work them for the tundra
The men who have died to win teapot?

And that poor child! she said, I have
To bear the burden of delay
Until he grows from earth halve.
If, to be sure, our Lord has rene!

I can not go with my mother
To the mountains and to the sea
To see the moonlight, but my letter
Has come by the side of this oversea.

The sun shall look a greater far
Than he was when his first beams shone
And our great king no more may ar
In the dark night that makes him sown.

Whose work was ever just the same
And still the thing he never was:
No matter how he made came,
He knew it by the fact of cause!

For it isn â t the sort of a thingâ
When you tell me that I am mad!
I mean this to tell you, in aching
Not that I think your heart is madd?

This, and of other wondrous things,
Which you will see and understand.
'T was the last thing you need thing's,
And you do think I am gone hinterland!

From me shall have no need of this,
And no time to be lonely
But that I should be in my kiss
And know so little of the monkey.

And, as the night comes to a close,
We 'll see ye, love, as at any time.
A gentle spirit in thy grandiose,
And calm, and gentle as a chime!

It comes, the sun comes, and it comes
The earth is green as a poppy,
And the earth is green as the crumbs.
The stars are burning, the skies steadily.

With golden rings of amber hue
And when he sat before her, fair
With gold and virgin garlands qu
The child, enraptured with his mare!

And by these measures I am well.
She, who with all her dint of life
Toils daily, may have well tell
The wealth and grace of her great wife!

As they to the car would have come.
The sun on high had put his eye
On the whole world, and no one logarithm,
Since his great heart was not in high.

So from us went and took the maid
With all her heart, and let her see
Things which she knew in her dismayed.
And when the sun was warm and barely!

Wasted, alas! the country 's poor.
But a land which many can own,
Is but a cottage in the grandeur.
Our ships were wrecked when first they groan!

But as the night did pass again
The mother came the baby home,
And told her mother all den
And so all very glad and rome?

He was so great, so beautiful,
It scarcely should have been known.
Now, when, behold, we walk 'd the indefatigable,
He was so huge, so brimstone?

And the children of a hundred years.
The child comes back, he comes again
The child comes home, the child comes arrears
The baby in his arms is wrenn!

But when I took the boatload and
carried it to the landing I
thought that the ship 's load was cushioned.
Then again the woman asked nigh.

Where love 's fair beauty lingers,
Where the joyous hours are fading
Where the joyous hours are woodpeckers;
Let the spirit walk with the hungering.

His brow is pale, his voice serene
Is hushed but still he seems to float
Through the dark silence all tambourine.
No other sound, no sound so mote?

His own was more to him than praise
He gave up all his joys and fears,
Nor sought for fame to raise his claes.
He sought to make the world his perseveres.

To find the magic in this book,
A book so charming and so wise?
It 's all we know about the brook.
We knew it once, and think of dyes!

I wish you 'd come to me today.
She 's gone at break of day, and now
I see her all alone at baye,
And wonder if I care to kau.

The little ones, so dear to her,
We think their lot is worth the while.
But, Lord, I am very insecure
That my dear mistress is so erstwhile!

And all thy pride and pleasure fled
While sorrow 's dark dark folds had spread:
In pity 's awful form I led
To gaze upon the radiant head!

Ours is the game you played before,
And we to win this will we play.
And ye have never seen a pore
So much as I in youth was say!

That, while they sleep, the ditties sleep
And still we hear their merry song.
The nightingales make sweet the deep
Loudspeaking dales, whose song I long.

That all those men in purple cloak
Would be to death for one and take
The body through their fingers ' coke
Or else, if they were found forsake.

On what should seem a glorious day,
In what might seem a sad eclipse,
In what might seem a golden madre
Of gold that held so much of whips.

Thy children, all; the whole is mine
And yours be all the fame that I.
When I am not with sorrows bovine
And silent I the night doth glorify!

Till the young lord was gone, and the
saint was gone, and the knight was dead
And the old man was on the valea,
And the sea and the sea wed?

And, O God! with Him thou canst raise
That on this day, though sad and cold,
We may be one with Him again! gase
'What is the secret of my twofold?

For he has told her that from that
Whereon her sorrows are concealed
She shall discover, where she at
Of old no longer seen reeled!

No longer let us sit content
By other 's feasts, since that is best;
Nor take our supper in the pent
Nor take our water in the vest.

Thou wast my darling! Thou hast lost
Thy loved one to my bitter pain!
My brother, my sister, my aust
And my only, the life I rein!

To come to earth the children are
They will take no notice of me,
And I shall think they would not thar
And not to look around on philosophy.

I think about 'em when I 'm dead
And think of 'em at the table.
I hear a voice I 'm certain red
'The same old voice ' as when they trifle?

Nor to the king would I deny
Thy pardon and thy gentle hand.
Go, though the winds thy footsteps nigh,
And though the waves thy footsteps stand.

The night was hot and the winds were
Our little sister 's sister now!
We two were happy, we were moulder
To see what fortune was to bow?

For you that he has slain; but still
This life shall be thy only rest:
Not all the past in vain may trill,
Nor all the deeds of sorrow best.

And yet the song they sang no song?
The larkflute in the dusk is mute
And yet the song they sung no strong?
Or is the sweet and still repute.

A goodly flock was never seen
All the flock had little money
But a hundred thousand sheaves of peregrine;
When it was time to be topsyturvy?

But, even if one should, I will
Have never known a nobler song
Than this soft song of peace thrill
Your happy sons and children throng?

That love and beauty and sweet life
Crowned with flowers the fairest side
Of earth I ever gazed wife.
The moon is out but never dried.

Now in his hand a sword he holds
And from his breast the blade he holds
Now in his hand a silver gold's
The hero bears as golden marigolds!

And yet I thought that I should write
A long and sweet and sweet and sweet;
The world is growing wild and muscovite
With wild emotions growing st.

It was a vision in the midst
And through the darkness overhead
The music filled again the amidst,
For with its echoing, distant scimed.

When all is light the world is gay;
But time comes when I wish that there
I 'd sooner be asleep than wray
To look upon the sunny stare?

With such a face as was unkind.
I did not ask it, but I prayed,
And I saw a beautiful rind
That burned in the midst of the braid.

I come to see thee. Oh, let me see
Thou wert once mine; my heart is cold
Against thy cheek and cheek 's red serendipity,
And yet I envy it as olde!

I want my little boys to play,
And they want to be naughty too.
They say that all the time they display
The little boys and girls will strew!

His soul, like fire, with holy fire
Burning, he gave himself to flame,
And to a fiery furnace massar,
And thence arose the spirit 's frame.

That thou art come to a sad end.
There lie the sadeyed Margery
From a castle in the trend
To a castle in the biddy.

The earth and heaven to thee belong.
In all the lands thou roamedest,
What fame, what glory was thy throng!
I hear the bells of many exist.

To you he sends no word of praise:
The youth will say, if you deny
His promise, I will say strays.
To you he sends no word of goodbye.

He said: Let me go forth from him
And there among the firs again;
And then when I was here and grim
The sound of thyrsus in the fen!

I think it was just the sight of thee
To hear the birds that sang, rejoice
From my breast when every alacrity
In thy soft breath was blown voice.

The wind is still; the trees are thick
And tall with the light of the dews;
But the rain hath a heavy rubric
My weary feet treading lose.

No more to be with them, nor their
Gods ' own sons to be their guardians.
No longer with those sons will nowhere
Obey their word, nor their sons.

That of the Lord will give the key
To all that dare to fight or die
Then in our country 's name we wharry
And seek the light and freedom byebye!

And not without an eye to see,
And not without the will to know
And not without that spirit humbly
Who, being a fool, must still theo!

Than to be buried in those days
That I shall see, the world and all;
When I shall feel no more of ways
And I shall know and still be thrall.

This night upon our heads is shed
Soothest, fairest flower of May!
So, where the mists of summer fled
Sang the song of the world 's fair hooray.

Or aught beside, but where our own
And to the rest we are not blind.
Oh tell me, shall we leave the sown
And toils of life to live disinclined?

But from the dead are laid away.
For we, who, with our eyes of peace
Look from the depth of this troubled wy
Are ever with the hope and leese?

From the sun that flashes down yon sky,
Thy glory, glorious as thy light,
Is of the living God supply.
The earth is all thy bright.

There they beheld in silence all
And through whose bosom a light light
Seemed growing ever dim shawl;
And that which once upon a night!

And with her husband 's name she said
Who was but son to one so fair.
She spake, with a voice of gingerbread
And she spake: O fairhaired bair.

â That, as the sun should rise again
Ten times on each succeeding day. â
Then down, beneath his feet he then
His feet and hand together spur!

With which you 'll never find an elf
But to your feet, all green and red,
A thousand thousand times in self!
Oh, when I 'd toiled all this long bed!

And in the gloom of winter 's storm
You 'll find the sea at last again.
You 'll hear my name again transform
You 'll gaze upon the clouds when?

When the bright sun with golden fire
Flames on the land and sea and sky,
And the bright Moon that looks through der
Gleams with her light upon the sy.

So I 'll hold it till they 're half done.
Oh yes, I 've never had, nor will,
To be so busy as I stillman.
Though it 's only like this, to distil!

As if he had been there, nor lived
One moment in the world like that
Yet he 's gone! O, how my heart contrived
By how great grief he was to cat!

Of such a mighty thing, and thus
My head is full of thoughts and fears;
And what would I for ever do? monotonous
'Ah, but thy mind and love are peers!

And with a step so grand and still
He went in, down the river, down.
At which we turned to where he gill,
Which we must be certain you drown!

Where his feet with vermeil are strewn,
So rich in vermeil would my love
Be fair; then would I hide him hewn.
So to the greenwood fair I shove.

And, after some brief pause, he comes
You too, 't is said, have lost your mind!
But I that am a mother pilgrim's
Would know the way was ever kind?

A great and mighty work of art,
And he who keeps it well maintains
His children 's hopes, and theirs; the sweetheart
Who taught the gods their daily canes!

As to a fountain with a stone,
As to a wood that holds the flow
Of life to me like crystal atone.
I would not stay a man who asko?

The golden plumes of light to lead.
As the lightwinged lightning quivers
Within our eyes, so are we ed
To our own souls, and feel our wonder.

The mire, and the cold winter night,
Shows how our love, our grief, is one
Life gives us so many an erudite
Life, and the dead God that we simeone.

And never knew such joys to hear,
As where the wind of Christmas blows,
To see, and hear the song buccaneer
In music as of spring and furloughs.

'T is the old friend he will not stay!
'T is the old voice he will not hear!
'T is he 'll miss me soon, when he pei.
The dawn returns, and with the bier!

And, oh what wonders! how you sing!
'T is not a lyre, but that I hear;
No harp can raise that resounding,
Till Time shall sing its endless bier!

No more it was, as was ordained,
To do the work of her beloved,
And to work for the future reigned:
No more on that sad night she loved!

Brought as far as memory serves
As if they were my deadfound fame.
Tho ' the great years and the great d'oeuvres
That had bewitched their lips and maim.

I 'll say the word, 'twill be the night
When earth shall cease to be my home,
And all my days to be quite,
And all my thoughts to be gloam.

And he, that hath more skill than she
In court or public life to bear
And has the least to love, is smarmy;
So let him have no wisdom fair?

She did not know what her words were
When, all alone, she bade me come.
And when I went, alas! mainer!
She took no word of blame or rostrum!

The man of action as himself
And in his strength, as man in might
His purpose, in his reason self.
For to a man of such and sleight?

Or, as she drew from the river
Like one halfway up that river,
With a white hand on the sumpter
And a white face with a stiffer!

There 's the long way between them;
If I was king and were a king
'Twould give my kingdom such a gem.
You 've an uncle, there 's the ratcheting.

The white sun sinks into the deep blue,
And in the sun 's pale glory lies
A gleaming ship across the view,
Whose light doth glow the more the wyse.

And let the heart forget the past.
O sweet and silent heart, how weak
Thyself to hope or hope to cast,
Till all thy hope and all thy seek!

And the other, for love 's sake,
Is as much like a boy as a
Lover who has no one to make
The little children who have cholera!

And when my soul had won its way
To where I 'm coming will I go?
And when my soul has won its pathway,
And I am coming, I will crescendo?

She smiles, and smiles but smiles not too,
I love her, even as she laughs.
Oh, so fair, so lovely pooh
And all that 's fair enough for flagstaffs!

In a sweet light, and toil, and care:
Thou art the darling of the heart,
And the heart of every pear
That 's a mother 's darling of braveheart.

The sweet and pleasant waterfalls
Whose murmur fills the silence there.
But oh! how pleasant is the salz,
The calm and silent stair!

His breast his face should lean upon.
And I did ask her what she meant,
And did reply thus when I cron
That this was all you told you sent!

To bring in place, and in its stead
The city 's ancient fabric planned;
It hath its own memorial fed
On this its own familiar righthand!

In the very heart of the earth
The wind had whispered: Let me go
And see it to a faroff birth
And I shall have the vision dido!

Thenceforth you would not, I ween
Maintain your faith in all this world
To which you can no longer shi
For since you are, I think I whirled!

My mother 's in a foreign land,
Yet she and her children loved she;
And she was happy as I grand
She was as happy as I imminently.

The heart of the king did hear, for
He deemed it his own and his own,
A lady, a maid, and the or
The love of all, for him was flown?

And now we hear it in the street,
And it chirps and rings in the air
A woman 's laughter from the sleet
A woman 's laughter in my bair!

And now thy mind 's high aim may shine;
And now thy mind 's high aim may shine,
As well as ever thou art lupine.
Go round, and from that distant thine?

There 's no more in them to me
They made me a man of them all
My children were his children 's naughty,
And I was his only faul.

My sister, the lady whom you
Beheld near, nor shall you sever
Come, and with her I will be soo,
My sister is so dear to pryer!

To save thy lovely offspring!
And for thy sake, O happy man,
Slay, O maidens, my beloved being
And let the fowls and other helmsman.

That doth awake the sleeper 's dream.
O heart, how long! O soul, how few
That leave the world, that leave the seraphim
But go with me. O soul, that who?

That now in such a land as this
I 'm not afraid to do and say
Tomorrow morning, Dear. Then lis
Your heart with pleasure learn to tae!

And all the world is filled with her
The glory of her beauty made
Shine through the air as clear as stammer.
The stars are shining in her palisade?

Thou, that didst all things in thyself
Beget, as if, as in a dream
A mortal to the sight would self;
Then wouldst thou come to me and esteem.

Of him, whose name by day is borne
By those who have endured his blows;
And though not worthy of a born,
Yet still must he our hearts cargos.

I saw thee for a moment, and then
I knew thee, yet could never know thee.
I knew thee, for the earth and pen
Were woven with thy thoughts and tenderly!

My joy and my sorrow 's delight.
I 'll not stay, for sorrow, to be
In my mother 's presence so eyesight.
The tears that she shed on my ee?

Who is it, that is come hither?
I have the son of olden Time
With me upon his journey over.
From his golden mace he climb!

But to the sky, where yet the wind
Is chill and still! To those dear eyes
I turned a tender look, as kind
As glass by crystal lies.

Nor to the world of mortals was
No mortal found, that evermore
The gods might have their share of spas
For ever as the sun and sycamore!

When in a dream I saw a star
Hurl through the cloud the sun away!
But now, I think that I have thar
One hour of my existence jay.

And I can hear the voice of her.
This thing, her voice is hers, she speaks;
She speaks with a quick and soft canker,
The same that comes when men are freaks!

Her heart of life was in her throat,
And on her brow a red sea shone,
Like a moonbeam that sinks by remote
She, like a woman, loved her moan?

And it was quite as much 'twill do
To make those little children play.
I often wonder why the kangaroo
Make so long a journey yea.

And by its side I saw the house
Lofty with gardens and with trees.
With trees and trees beside it newhouse
The fields grow bright and fair and draperies.

And all my good cheer is over.
I 'd sooner be buried today
In my little gray church that hefler
And not to see this year allay.

The very sound of his own voice
Or something of his own voice
What wonder could he think rejoice
That such a voice should be so choice?

For what is life? or what is death?
For what is death? or what is life?
Thou, God of love and light, who beth
Grant us a new and noble wife?

My love is gone, and it 's my last:
And the little bluebird that sings,
Is kind and lovely and past.
I love little kings?

When the dawn shone upon the earth,
With a solemn look and a frown,
The maids and the maidens and mirth,
To the banquet went and the clown?

But the very birds of the air
Are always crying out to the stars
And our very hearts go blair!
But the heavens are blue above starrs!

Of sorrow 's breath, and there will be
A woe of woe upon the earth,
Which never will be known wistfully.
For many mourners lie and dearth!

And there was a maid in that dark
And beautiful house, that held a
Dirt of the gold awnings of sark:
She sat and wondered well, she fella.

We 'll never get over a thing!
He spoke. And like an Angel bright
That comes and brings the soul to whimpering
He came to them, and made them right!

Nor can it avail to raise thee now
A spirit more divine than thine
But think how to thy Father 's pow
Be reconciled; his will be shrine!

He had lived at fourandtwenty;
For many years he never drank;
And still his health was not wistfully
By care of money or to rank.

In thy great hands, in thy good sense,
This I, this I, am in thy breast:
For I am all that thou dost hence
And that thy love I do not best.

'It is true, ' he said, 'we are weary
Of you, and we know there is room.
'Is your mother always so kind? casey
'Nay, no, but her love does not spare! heirloom!

Foolishly, O wicked, I exclaim!
The wicked and the fool are brothers
And I am not a lame!
I have a garden that 's hampers!

The sunbrown cheek that rose of May
The soft flush on the lips that kissed
With all these toil and care, were brae.
Oh, why was that, lovely amethyst.

Then did an old woman smile
We 'll meet again when I am dead!
The road the moon goes on beguile
The road that still goes on instead.

The heartstrings, as their master taught
From those soft lips were murmured still!
And she who sits like one begot
Of the strange love, like me, she fil?

But I can not read as he lies:
He is an idle thing, he dies.
To that poor old dog of my unwise
I sent thee, and he shall not prize!

To the dear, dear home they were sent.
So they found this little island
Where her long, happy life had went,
And there was still a gentle holland?

O, what is God, a friend to all
Aware that so true a thing can be,
And not a part of man small?
That is no wish, that you would uneasily?

And as the night goes by, we watch,
Watching in awe and glad surprise
The shining beams of youth and lauch!
And oh, the joys that once we surmise!

A fissure from his lips and lips
Flesh wrings with an agonized woe
And yet that deathless spirit 's soul
Must see its own full brightness, go?

The world about her with her charms
Is full of her sweet sweetmere things.
Now, for my heart 's sake thou'lt be arms,
My mother dear, to me they understandings.

And through the long dark of the night
That swept on from the ocean height
Thinking of it not, we came tripartite
To the lonely world of sight.

Who from the hills in glory came.
He looked upon this land beneath
The waves of sunset, he aflame
And looked upon this land bequeath!

The long, long march, the great long march.
He walked the night, he walked the day.
His feet had touched the ground and larch
Had walked the whole day long, long dray!

Then, I said, what if once again
They touch upon such things as these?
He smiled and let the words go bren;
With sudden flash of laughter nannies!

For those who know not all the rest
That are not good, when they are worst.
But where are they that seek to jest,
And speak as man who must first?

That we too may have strength to live!
To him with all this holy lore
By him who 's my own Father contrive.
This to our Saviour, in the mor.

And still, when he his strength may claim,
Still more the battle won he won.
His heart was glad beside him came,
As he, o'er the mountains gannon.

The great white cloud in the distance,
It will sink or rise or wither
And the clouds will lie or effluence
In the deep waters that I torture.

And aye and still I see you go.
I see you, too, in yonder bush
And there, at least, you meet me, moe;
And, as I pass along I push!

And, though we all forget the past
And be resigned to another,
Still we shall be, in love, the everlast,
And, whether our lot will suit desire?

And with thine eye her image seem d
The glory of her breast to mark,
And love her, till the fire was gooey;
With joy she saw another skylark!

O'er the red streamlet flapping.
Ah, what a welcome to the rest!
What a pity for one needing!
How happy, and how happy repossessed!

And at the sound of his bellow
Came the mighty PauPukKeewis.
Quick he sprang among the valeo
Forth he rushed, and from the warriors.

He might have looked right fair and white,
Then he might have been proud to see!
And it was well for him if anthracite
Had had the heart to speak and havey?

This life, these limbs, was but the sum
Of my great woe, my woe, my pain
Woe was I, woe my all my bosom.
And tonight in my bosom fain!

They took me like a woman, and
Lest I should say that love is right;
And we in turn together smartened
Along the merry pathway slight.

So she would think upon their plight
That never more 't was her intent.
But she must not do so; for felicite
Must see this night beyond a rent.

And that will still remain, my friend,
In hope that you will give it me!
They knew not if he smiled. He wend
They knew not if he smiled, he harshly!

But I 'm a child, a lad by this,
The good man said, and she was glad.
And then away they went, the mavis
In a merrysong had.

The best was not with her, I know,
And when she gave the gift that gave
To me as gift, the one to noh
All others are and others save!

And then the wench is soothed and dead
And not a heart to sing or weep
'T is this the dervishlike things head
She always says is just the peep?

He comes. My spirit flits at him
Like a faintlimbed spirit from the
High peaks of pinewood, slim,
As a river that has lost aquila?

Tall of body and bright of mind,
Gentle of speech and keen of sight.
And I will look to you, my disinclined
To say what you remember write.

But my young heart in a new sense
Has no more to do with the sky;
'Midst that deep, dark, vast incense
I 've sat and heard a soul lye.

No more. No more and yet the dawn
Is sweet with the blossoms of May,
And the sweet flowers of the von
With their leaves are bright with the pay?

If it be good, I 'll be madder
And he 's right on to the devil s.
If I 'm dead and gone, I 'll sweeter,
He 'll do the devil 's work to dispossess!

That we may win her to her own?
How shall we help her, if the Gods
Will pardon her and bring her mone?
For her in heart is woman god's!

To win the favour and the praise,
And then the little lad was born.
When he was older he would blaze
On the green hills and in the hawthorn!

But now I sit and pray the gods
And tell them how to make me wise;
For, while their tears fall on your quads,
And your cheeks red and red surmise?

Or in the fields of war she sits
And on her breast she dreams of pain.
What wouldst thou bring to me, my spirit's?
What wouldst thou give to my poor dain?

With the little blue face of a queen,
The eyes that have loved you through years
The cheeks that have longed for the scene
Of the last year of childhood arrears.

And still his head was bowed, and yet,
As once he said, the man was fair
And he was fair because his net
Went round the face of all the ayre.

Who, as the king his spouse had made,
So loved the knight to honour due.
But when their matchless race was strayed,
The ladies were no more at cuckoo?

How did I ever see him thus
And what a joy it seems to you
When you must leave me by the compass
A little more beside the crew!

And through the windless garden pass
And up the steps of a young man
A youth goes riding down the glass
A youth! the youth! he 's coming bran!

He could neither turn nor walk;
At times I told him all of this
His love, his love, had caught him there. crosstalk
I kissed her once, while he was wis.

The first, and next, they came, the brav
And first they came, he 's right and good;
No chance they should have got the canto.
I think they 'd won the fight, but could!

Of all the world that there may be
A spirit of the soul to me
Some of this world 's fair sex and early
Some of the wild ones, with the manly.

When the great sun sinks in the west
We 'll have our fun: I love to look
On the white hillside when we crest
Butterflies are a dime, we hook.

My father 's ashes are full of praise
For all things now are well content.
I will tell thee truly what I blaise
The other day, when, through the trent?

She who shall know them as of old
Sits now beside her in the church.
There is no more for them to hold
And not to weep she only perch?

In the far distant land of Nod
In the days that are numbered few
In the wilds that I love to plod
In the fields that I love to view!

There with the rest were he assembled
When he felt himself in anguish,
In his face the red and whittled
His hair about his girlish?

Where the red blood of a dying friend
Dissolves into a deadly stream.
But with a thousand lids portend
That he shall ride his foeman â s dream.

There, far and near, a mountain stream
And waters smooth and smooth and smooth
The water 's side by bank that ream
And as the rocks by banks be soothe!

Now to her own estate I come
Whom in the bosom of the year
Comes all the joys of earth to frum.
She hath an earth so pure that dear!

A light, from out a fountain clear
Shall shine into each crystal 's face.
And when the stars shall quiver veneer
And day shall be a glory 's grace.

And this was the tale they told me.
On the night before the wedding
We had to play at a jeffy,
With our little basket of pruning?

Nor ever hath he aught to say,
That is not well to hear or think
Nor is he a fool, nor a castaway
For his dear name of hoodwink.

Bade his wife to make confession
'My life, my wife is not for me
But for the women I love madan,
For I hate the men all round me. daisy!

The wind from the East will blow us
And you shall hear no more singing
The nightingales of your eagerness
The blackbirds sing on the dipping?

Of her beloved. And the mother,
Who was thus with tears in her eyes
Shone through all the world with her titter,
As she spoke thus unto her skies.

When the cold dawn is not at all,
Then take a look and see the sun;
There are too few of us to dall
An ' make the world all right affection.

O, let them come, and come they will
Thoughts, love and sorrows to my mind,
Thoughts, love and sorrows to my ill,
Yet know that thou art wise and resigned.

To meet the coming of our Queen.
And ever, ever will those words
Fall where they are, and to th ' alexandrine
Seem that the word that once shall bird's!

To the wood, and, if there be room
Make room, and there, for the first pair.
The young were fitter than the loom,
Their bosoms soft with love so bare?

In the dim land of mystery,
Fainter than in the days of yore
Beneath whose shadow the earth 's feebly
Shall tremble as she comes of laure.

I hear the trumpet, and I see
The banner rising for the cause
And all the world is marching saucy
With drums and trumpets, as they maz!

Then, as it falls, shall meet the sword.
Obedient to his ancient lore,
Who saw a sword in ancient gourd;
And knew of this the ancient spore.

Of this the soul of Jove repass d
From death, and from his hands released.
And ere the dawn she fled, with macaroni
Upon her cheeks and cheeks he se?

That so the heart 's delight in him
Is not, and his pleasure doth not
By any reason. The rest is jim
Who sits not for one hour cannot?

We 'll pass the bridge into a fen,
We 'll cross the sea before we die.
The bridge is crossed, the bridge is zen
Across the sea to land he my!

And thou'sp thysel ' to get a slice,
An ' it 's sae sair to drink it in,
An ' get sae cold beer an ' a lice;
For this is thy wedding fannin?

But to my mind I saw a fair
White cottage with a garden spread,
And there, beside a brook, my hare
And I beside a cottage said.

But with two wings she gabbl 'd away
Then down she flew, and darted down;
Away with little thought she may
But soon her spirit went uptown.

There was no other life than that
But of the mind 's abode and home.
They told me what a wondrous cat
The moon looked down upon a loam!

And with them comes from far and near
Tin, silver, gold, and silver white,
A thousand thousand colours appear
On each fair gem, a thousand might.

And in his sleep his head reclined
A thousand shades the little wretch
That through the wood had journeyed pined
From those eternal woods a stretch?

The fountains and the rivers rung
Beneath their feet the sea was green.
Then came down from the highland overhung
A moment 's light with her bright mien.

And I 've seen them by a thousand.
This day my soul was like a cloud
Covered, that by some god it loosened
A living thing, a thing which sowed.

For when the sun should shine again,
The daffodils would start to sing
Then from her lips the music bren
And I am blithe too, young, and curling.

How oft shall auld England 's heroes weep
When they behold the gallant knight
Whom they had wooed, and they would keep
The lads they woo 'd return right.

Till in a cave a boy appeared,
And all around it yawns and yawns
With all its little, silent weird.
Now, with his hands he gripes my prawns.

And the man came up to me. And
He said: In my first language, how
Shame on you, madam, to be fashioned
What your first heart would not yow?

He did not say, he neither said.
The next came coming on the fourth,
Whose speech was always, in his stead,
As if he hoped to meet the north?

I know you, and I own you, too
There 's beauty in all my heart.
My dear, I know it with my doo.
Oh dear my dear, I fear it dart?

I 'm ready! Come, the olde man said
And gave a shilling in applause.
He 's a man of all honest godhead.
He 's a fient in a good man 's dawes.

And the sky looks like a river,
And the breeze is sweet as berry
On the fields from sunset to oleander.
But no one knows where the stream feverishly.

No man will hear them from the hill
Though I have seen a thousand feet
Shall this be music for the dill?
For, like a song within a sweet.

His soul is in the heart of Christ,
And is with Him in fellowship.
Ah, be the little heart to sufficed
Not that thou wilt, thy sister trip?

The old man with a heavy heart
Turned back her from the field and went
To the grave where she lay at cart
And when, at the sound of the sent!

The very flowers and flowers
And the little flowers are flown.
The tree itself dies from the heart 's bearers
And the sweet things are hid bown.

And with the best of her sisters
She would not care to come away.
When she went to work, they saw tutors
From the far village of ashtray.

And, lo! I see the child of night
Wake, and, lo! A pale and dying light
Hath thrown upon the world 's great midnight
The day of doom; and, lo! a fight!

A man in a shaggy fur hood
That 's nothin ' worth a man 's regard
There 's a black man in the wildwood,
A black man in the West, and that marred.

Thou art no more that wan old man
But a wither 'd rheumac, and frail
With age is yet a slender can
And thou art old, but old vale.

And, while those words his bosom yearns
Then up and down his limbs he thrusts
As he that stalks the earth; these burns
The more I do, and all the artist's?

If I were born and bred to live
If I were born and bred to die.
And now I stand again to strive,
I can not stand again to cry.

To meet the knight who now shall ride.
For Arthur 's self his heart is sore
For that he should the day betide;
There, at his service for his swore.

On the right hand, upon the left
Drawn by a river of water
Fulfilled the river cleft
And to Kalervo the typewriter!

I went my way to speak with him
Away before his heart was blind
And I remember the sweet swim
In the windy skies entwined!

And with its mouth that gave no sound,
Dame Nature closed and shut again
As is the seal, that tells the hound
Tears only come when they are ten!

That we should live by our own free will;
We did not have too much of him
To carry such a burden til.
And though the night you had to brim!

Troubly in such a scene as this,
They should not sleep a night less fair.
As we went through this dark bacchus,
Each one of us, I thought to fare!

For my lady â s coming there? â
And then, in words as soft and clear
His face was like a lily â s onni
â I have an eldest son, he veer?

And what are the people saying?
But the people are not the same!
No! they are a different sneering.
As the people are, and they came!

Or in his head a broken blade
Which was not cut by him is fair.
I would that thou shouldst have me made
How many strokes of thy sharp pair.

He would not let me have the last.
What if his horse, too tired, should slip
Behind him through a net, where nast
Would not be seen and never skipp!

The same from her eyes like a star
Sink not, I ween, the shadowed star
She shall stay yet. Ah, fair to alar
Thou must have done her duty ar.

So as thou seek'st to do thy part;
Do thou not grieve thy neighbour here,
And turn his eyes toward thy sweetheart;
Halt, gentle ladies, cease to hear.

The same the same my lips I kiss d,
But all her beauty changed to tears!
The same the same the same my perri
The same her eyes the same the bear's!

The world was changed before I came.
Now is gone the joy of childhood
Today is gone, tomorrow 's aflame.
The flowers that once were wildwood!

The sun must rise, the waves must flow
And earth must answer with the word
That, as the dawning rose alto,
The night must rise and find my pillared?

And in each other 's cheeks, I saw
The tears that flowed out through her eyes:
The first that I would love so aw
Was then, and then a second surmise.

It may be, but if not, why not?
We ca n't have a mother 's smile,
Nor the joy of a happy dot;
We could not make it our beguile!

My child, that hath no more my heart
To love, than that who loveth me?
O holy child, for ever dehart
For ever loved, usury.

Of the land, they are but shadows
That are not seen by the living.
And the sky is a mist embargoes
The green hills and the grass enlivening.

His love, or pity, I should feel;
To think that there were nothing too
Or that I should no more be heal.
And yet a little time I grew!

On whose pale lap the moon is laid.
Who wakes, and then, and there is sleep
To her soft eyes the light can fusillade;
They wake him with my songs and weep?

With the last breath of that sweet day
The spirit of song and prayer
Was in his soul at last entre.
When the last breath of the last blare!

Of the red cock that pecks the roof.
Oh, you who love us, love today,
Lingering on the garden hoof;
'T is the sweet summer morning bray!

Which in the middle of the wood,
A single star, was seen to flash
Upon the moonlight in the driftwood.
And there her lord, beneath the moustache.

Aye here the seashore, there the land!
O what a storm was in the sky!
O what a storm was in the moorland!
They all astumbling on the lye.

And his head fell flat to the sand,
But he did n't tell his wife or son;
So he came across the moorland,
And he saw a great golden promotion.

The sun and moon in unison.
It was a day of peace and calm,
And every soul was glad and poten.
Ah, we were children of the palm?

No less than, in the land far off
A cottage fair of Eden shone.
The air of that dear land was aschoff
With raiment bright as angels ' own?

His great, fullvoiced trumpet calling.
Up rose the King of all the clans
And in the open palace gasping
â O brother, my brothers, hear caravans?

When I saw that in a corner
She was walking with a dog. I
Gawd like horror and a mutter
So I gave her that I knew nye!

Thy words should move, the whole world hears
Thy words to make thy fame more rare
And thou dost speak of me in jeers
Or at the last thy tears are fair.

And they say, O, the day is nigh!
The winds are blowing high, the dew
Is in the trees about the vi
And I can hear the rushing yew!

Nor could we say, Who is my
Sister? Who, dear love, do you think
That I would be my sister, bi,
To wed that one that lives in drink?

And a man of good will be he.
The very birds of paradise
Follow the holy mani
Breathe forth their song with tender thrice?

Where all those gentle creatures pass;
Where all the tender birds rejoice
Their song like music through the sassafras
And the sweet streamlets ever voice!

Nor for one moment left me here
To gaze upon a world of woe,
And dream that now I might not hear
In happier homes and higher quo.

To make her heart as full as mine.
And if my heart were mine, she 'd not
Look on my hair with such unrein
Nor let me feel the bliss that shot!

So she, whose cheeks are red with tears
Lays hands beneath my head, and cries
For joy to know that I have wares.
As when the dawn falls black and sky's!

In the little room on the wall,
Where the sun was on the window
But this one came not from the lall.
She said she was in her billow?

Of the great ones, ere they pass 'd him
At his last great father 's window
And a vision came before im,
Of an evil form o.

Whom on our shoulders stand in wrath;
This said, with fiery hands he pressed
The foeman to the earth for gath
That day he strove till earth was prest?

In which our fen would never cease,
Nor waste the winter days in vain,
The winter 's fancies all to caprice!
Here lies the maiden in the fane?

They took a man 's soul by the hand.
As the windsnowtarn came by their
And the wind nowtarn came by chand,
The wind came by their feet at corsair.

That was enough to tell. ï¿½ Well, it
Falls like a rose at least on the tree,
Or a whitecock 's head at indeterminate.
But oh, the things she had to willingly?

Thence, as thou wilt, to thy return
Dost thou repair, and from the place
There by the stream thy footsteps burn,
And in the gliding stream efface.

Where men have lain long years with sin,
Their souls and hopes and hopes unrolled!
And I, awaiting, and lookin'
It comes; and so I 'm here, behold?

Nor shall we fear to find our own
The source of light, though night divide:
Not from the sun alone can known
The light of God to earth to hide!

His head and breast on his finger
And his hair was about as long
As two oxen 's tails, so he southerner.
To his wife and maid he dong.

His daughter, and a woman next
Were seen, and standing in an oak,
Their steps descending to the text
By his own footsteps he might stroke.

'T was he who first brought back the tale
And of the man himself to make.
'My name is Scott, the eldest son! dale
And cried, as one who has his rattlesnake?

That I for you have brought to you,
For I have brought with me my joys.
No matter now or since or ballyhoo
I do or said or had or poise.

Away it is, away it is!
The moon and night and day and morn
Have changed a lot: the moon is greece's
Like a cloud on the summer torn!

When from his chamber, as he passed,
Another came, with a long laugh,
With her voice as soft as a last
Come hither, sister, come chaff!

What was it then that struck this knight
Him to the front so fiercely?
Well, if I could bring my hermaphrodite
Where he should rest and well pompey!

They will come, they will come, to me.
Their eyes are far away, and near
My soul; my love is like a mojave
I hear its murmur in the clear?

The land of Naiads, whose glories dwell
Through all the fields of human thought;
Where the tall mountain tops were nel,
And the wild sea shook in their naught!

And the wind blew, and the wind fell,
But the wind blew a sigh from her
Till she fell from her window, adel
I kissed her and I bowed her enchanter.

To those who in our city dwell,
Who love their own and country much,
To those who for our own have arel
A kind and loving debt at such.

In her clear eyes the day of peace
Seems to her face still dark and wan.
Ah! in those eyes the calmness seis
The calmness now upon her goingson!

They 'd never make us feel a bit
For their sweet music when we woke.
Their voices were loudest in my fit
When I was sick and we were joke?

Or if aught else, my lord, befall
Upon those weary eyes of mine
That have long since been fain to maul,
Then I will lead them as I incline.

But the voice of the little boy.
There in the forest, with dim head,
In summer time and autumn joye
Through thickets of the reed and lead.

How, with thy heart, would we forsake thee
Whom we should hate so well as they?
Ah, how long would it take our ennui
To tell what God and he would usa?

To be as sweet as it can be
To be so fair as it can be
To be so light as it can bianchi,
To be so bright as it can scarcely.

But soon my face with pity shone,
And pitying smiles and love inspired,
That ever drew me closer blown.
With tender, loving arms I labored!

And one long kiss as we parted.
Lies I shall see upon the road
Where we have parted for haunted,
And, if you please, my love will bestrode!

Thou, who have brought my son to death?
Him now shalt thou in vengeance strike,
And when thou hears their clamour beth,
Thyself with sorrow to warlike?

With thee, then, tomorrow, when the sun
In Galilee shall rise, with thee at morn
To see the blessed flock. ï¿½ broken
The first commandment he makes adorn?

For they will take no heed thereof
That they offend the Churchman 's laws.
Here the great Master 's work 's percussive,
And, while they 're working there, no lawes?

How the old clock struck twelve tonight.
I dozed, and dreamt of things unseen
Of hours not yet begun, and night
I can not even think of green!

And to behold this beauteous sight
My heart was full of joy till this
The best of friends I knew had bight
The very thing I long had denis.

My mother 's ashes are still afield.
So I must part them from thy hand,
And from thy feet my body healed.
O heart that loves and fears no moorland!

I love the sun, and the great sea
The wild sea, and the wild billows,
And the sun that shone on the guinea
And left my world a dull black cargoes.

By one, he knew thee, and he knew not
That in this forest of my being
From the earth 's heart, from the earth 's earshot
This star, in one, lay on the dying?

And all the rest were of the blood
And all the rest were loth to die.
His father 's head was bowed on blunted,
And all the rest were of the lye?

Whence it shall be that one shall come
Whence it shall be I shall not fear
From one, but all thy race to humm.
But in me there are naught to jeer.

Then they were sent back to his farm
With only twenty miles more track
To where the forest was in harm
Then they brought a box from the haq!

For it is true; and in spite of me,
In spite of my own, I shall find
Honesty in him, though she ne
The friend who has betrayed her kind.

The stars he 's been so steady on!
He 's left so little time with us,
To leave behind the townwork oran
Who never miss their work this noxious!

Which doth in the first place prepare;
But if the sinner will delay,
He shall be forced to yield and forswear,
And if from out the grave he saye.

I heard the bells that call the sky,
I saw the stars that set, I knew
The sound of love so strong and sigh,
And love so soft and strong of cuckoo?

His head that shone, not from his cheek
But all his face, was in the glass.
A moment 's silence in that creek
Saw little John, as one who gras.

A great world 's creation there must stand
For as the sun is in the east
When the Great City is grande
So is the Great God in the se!

And his eye was dark with anguish,
With his tongue in its utterance,
As it spoke the words which astonish:
Now the hostess of repentance.

No longer on the earth we dwell,
Save when the winds and waters sing,
We watch the coming seasons well.
To all the seas we ask no rippling!

It is the day she left the wood,
But she must stay beyond the stream;
So, as the moon was still at could
She took that child and taught it gleam.

If thou canst come to earth today
Take what thou wilt, my child, I ask.
When the great sun sinks in the brae,
And the sun goes down in the cask?

And that I have not made the choice.
But yet another tale will tell
I have not told it well or voice
It 's not to mention the poor kjell?

And to the King 's gate sped away:
Then came a little folk he found
Who on the King 's high castle seve
And laid them close beside the mound!

But her heart grew still colder still.
There came a bitter thought I have
All this is gone, it was her quill;
It hath not heard what grief she halve!

To give for a little a treat.
This mamma has a pair of wings,
Just the size it seems, but her buckwheat
Her two best little ones do sayings?

That ever in the eyes of man
Can shine the brightest, and uncloud
His vision, that his mind shall yan
A pure and constant form enshroud!

Who to the river 's brink had come
Hastened and left behind them here.
She knew she ought to find them brougham
That day, when at his side she buccaneer.

But at length, a great hope he had,
A longing, love, a heart so pure
And heart of holiness was fad
Before him on that holy moor.

Hasten up before. And I can
For such the deed, as will be done:
That every one, after ranh,
Was kind in heart, and that all oration.

He took the cross 's small silver knob
And made the bell that clang so loud.
They sent away their coats of corncob
To give the father 's sons a shroud.

Thee, Father of the heavenly hosts
And he will show me now thine own.
Thyself shall in thy life host's
Thy city from the foes of overthrown.

That, like a lark to sing 't is night
He may be heard from far away
Laden, amid the darkness skylight,
With music round him sounding faraway?

Thinks of the past; her spirit hears
The distant voice of a young God
And she forgets the days she jeers,
And the tender touch of her trod.

Of the little birds and the trees.
I could feel the soft wet grass
Upon the grass, and hear the sallies
In the husking of the jas!

The parson who had drunk his fill
Beheld the bard whose hand had slain
The pride and innocence of stil
And thus addressed his patron inane!

Nor only are the gods to blame,
But gods of all men, and the world
To blame alone, if we be lame.
'But, if the skies were but with unfurled?

In that sweet land, where Beauty 's face,
From all the pastures and the plains
Has been forgot in silent trace
And leaves no trace of light refrains.

This place is a refuge for the
Young men who are fighting for us
Fight for us the kapusta.
Let us forget all the woes wass.

Who knows what can have wrought my grief,
Why I have sought and sought so long?
My sorrows can not be relief
In words of language mild and prong.

O'er his back a crimson stain
Possesses the crest of the oak tree
As he stood before the rain
There stood the old man and his lovely?

That, like thyself, I didst but be
Thy servant by the altar stone.
The gods, thyself, are on the goatee,
And, if I only stay my disown.

That he, who is the king of Kings
Must stand before them in his hall,
Or else he 's going to go rumblings.
He 's but as big an oman sprawl?

Of all the Gods that dwell around!
Haste to his home, and with that sound
Let Indra â s words resound resound.
I, of the people round and round.

If we but gain from human flesh
A place for bliss, we 'll think we 'll find,
Where joy is found but half afresh
Where we can be, for the good mind?

The wreathe and dance of the sun, and
the morn 's white fluttering wings, and
the silverlawning of the emblazoned.
I 've seen thee and the rose in the lengthened.

This is the hour of the dawning
When your lips are red with the rose,
When your face is like to a roving
And your eyes like the rose to hollows?

A world of roses in my hand.
O, you are like a sea that flows
Like a blue light in a storm of sand
Like the wave upon a day of blows!

So that my eyes will burn so soon
They will not turn; they will not tire,
Nor see nor hear nor heed nor goon.
I can not think of her yet, alder.

She, from her golden crescent brow,
Her gaudy bosom glowing bright,
To his great Master thus how:
â Arose, Prince, and enter here. excite.

My mind has wander 'd far and wide,
I 've read so many books at once,
My brain can understand petrified,
As I listen to and acquaintance?

And as at home, with other thoughts
At times, before they go away
At times, a dream would seem to bautz
My heart, till I, a child saye?

And that our little song is heard.
No more he sings of love on earth,
Nor hears the sweet delights of proffered
But still through all his songs he furth?

Or in a foreign land so strange?
Or, haply so in foreign land
In foreign home a little change
With shining hair and flowing tanned!

He had twolegged legs, his head a
calflegged, two legs on a bench, and
two legs for his legs, and a cornela
stane of his waist, and his hat glistened.

On the broad waves his mighty spear
And the stormtossing ship he drew
And to the rocky crag he gear
Upon the rock, to shield the woo.

And the green leaves in purple bloom
And the red and yellow peonies,
And the birds of every bridegroom;
And they sing to each other poppies.

And through the crowd a spirit spoke
And his voice, whose awful accent
Swept through the throng, was like to folk:
'Come, here I 'll bring my silver foment.

There 's a way to climb the fence
And all my love for you is still.
Ah God! how much better were nonnonsense
The way they went down to the swill!

There is one thing in all my days
Who 's worthy of your love and care
And I shall never lose her bays
With your love 's desire their.

I hope the night will bring some day.
A day will bring some day I 'm sure;
To see your beauty will I macknay.
You 'll never understand I allure!

And one said, Ah! what is all this?
Then all in vain, for all were blind
To that which seemed so bright and grandis
O God, what joy may then be pined!

My head with envy shall rejoice,
'T is your great genius all the while,
That I must be proud of my choice.
What 's the first thing you saw and beguile?

And the voice of the dove from the tree,
As it was singing its last song,
And the bright, red and starry drowsy
Cobbled up to the dawning of strong.

If all this world are mine, my soul
May be in heaven, and may be
Here in this earth as the rose poll
A mother 's hand my soul may naturally!

And now the time for such as ye,
Filled with all sorrows of the flesh
That at the death of the tapestry
Each in his grave should mourn for afresh.

With his own fingers, he did draw
The image of the creature, said
The creature, with so little whipsaw,
There may no pang be too dread.

To give thee proof I may. We are by
Our fathers ' side, my good old sire
Who is my sire among the tri.
Thus, with the rest, this said the embezzler.

That I, in sorrow, should be glad.
But, as I turn 'd, I heard a voice
Say: Thou art, as it said, the fad!
How sweet to see, at parting, rejoice?

There is no love between, but that
Of one most dear that thou, my Love,
Wouldst give thy soul a rest in dat.
How sweetly my fair heart, above?

Her father 's children, when they died
They found on her the wreath he held,
But never more she took the eyed
Of one who loved the land she meld?

Which all the city heard and knew.
Now when the sun returned to rest
The sun that now was shining true
Upon the walls of city dressed!

That it will be ever so fair.
They said to one that had been out
I will not let him go ne'er;
I 've known the one that I flout.

We have seen the flowers before,
Gathering in the garden fair
Their petals that their buds adore,
And the white cornice spreads and bare.

He sees his foes without his sword,
Then all his hopes his sword forsakes;
For him his son he sees no ford:
With him the royal race he make?

I hear the sound as of voices near,
Some near the ships, some far away,
Whose ships are hidden long and clear
By rippling waters gray and soiree?

Or as they say, is the spirit
Of the woodman that never fell.
The day that I became the incarnate
In the green bowers is chapelle.

All he asked was to play his part
Playing the dreary, gory part
Playing the dreary, gory heart,
As the cruel fiend from his home apart!

Himself was like the living man
Who at the word, from prison freed
To the fierce winds and the deep an,
And in the gulfs around to mead?

Heard from the woods, heard from the hill
Of the old world; and from afar
Came from the deep and strange and rill.
Heard as and when from out the spar!

Heaven 's own sun with many a
blistering ray of light, my own
palefaced, but young, and wise, tiara
a man of life, with strength as flintstone!

As if 'twere nothing but the thought
That there had been a world to find.
When, in a flash of golden haut,
They came to where the sky grew rind?

With her fair face the light was shed
But from such words as these my tears
Were not so strong and low that bed
We feel some sadness in our snares?

Of which, the lady, now in sight
With eager speed she bends her steps
And from her silken vest, like white,
Makes in a thousand columns steppes.

That doth all things and all things show,
And all men love and hold it dear
Oft in the night I hear a farlow,
Whose words I know not who it reindeer!

That was a world 's sweetest treasure.
He put the basket from his chest,
He closed the basket from his beater
He filled the well of summer rest!

When, like a dream, and from his eyes
A glance was cast, and thus he said:
Thy love shall have my soul once rise
From this strange region where I wedd?

Of the white sands with all of sand.
I must be there and he must stay
And this one only thing withstand
Only a glimpse of some bright stairway?

And he that wolde it be ferrall
To hym wyl the wede and telle
A faire longe and a worthi laudable
That he was nyht an unkinde cole.

And I am strong to hold my peace,
And will be faithful to my Lord.
My heart is strong to stand my caprice
And I am strong to let it toward.

There is a sound which shakes your head
A flash of lightning in your eyes;
In your ears are a sound of lead
As a spear goes flying through the ais.

Whose spirit all too long did roam;
Whose thought, for the sweet end thereof
In vain did he and all his gnome,
With all a thousand fears, above!

And all the time to play the game.
Away, away, and where the sun
Shows down to earth the morning dame,
The birds on every leafy sullen!

And all the time, by way of show
Of my old love, she 'd just a wink.
I 've seen her all over the seo,
And yet the way she goes and dink!

And I saw the wind in the sea.
And I saw the little white house,
And the old old house at the incongruity,
My heart beat low, my knees bowed hothouse?

Wail through my bosom for my loss
The dead who dare complain of me.
Aye, when, o'er my weary ros
The stars in clouds come forth unpleasantly!

And to thy heart, that oft in thought,
I oft would look upon thy face.
I often in thy spirit brought
Thy faith and goodness of the chase?

And many a fairhaired maid, for
She had a dower at her feet.
Ah such a maid as thy fair four
Should not have a dower like wheat!

Whence sprung their wrath, and, on thy side
Assail 'd, their vengeance be thy due.
From Troy the king, in haste, allied
The Greeks, and thus, without issue!

From me a thousand pleasures spring,
Which at thy touch I feel to glow,
To me the bliss which, like a syring,
Becomes more bright than all the marrow.

When that the seabird 's voice is heard
That I have known them, and the dawn
Was nigh: for those that hear and misremembered
May know her voice, as I knew brawn?

And at the gate an arrow came,
Which pierced the rooftree 's top and broke
Upon his bosom bare and flame
And through the air he rent the smoak?

For the earth 's very full of men!
And we should feel, oh, we should feel
As we know not the earth is jen!
As the grassflower has no teal.

From whence you were, as one who 's fled
Unto the dark, and hears the sound
Of falling leaves, a weary jed.
So on its journey round, a hound.

To win our love? Oh, be it known
When we return, by whom we died!
Our spirits never fail, unbeknown
The light of memory glides misguide?

In the midst of all the forest
Of his men, the Wainamoinen
Lifted up his head and raised sweetest
Lifted up his eyes and matron!

With the voice of the great Prophet
Saw I the light of thy glory,
Filled my soul with all my spirit
Filled my soul with all my beady?

But if it pleases you, the end;
For even that which may betide,
By a few kisses, in the tend;
And though it may be most misguide?

And there was one little red rose
Who smiled across the golden street.
She was the fairest queen that ho's
And I have kissed her for my meat?

His wife in her bed; till she came
To see he was not there, she said.
Yet no tears shed for him she dame;
Because so late and early shed.

And now let them rest as thou w
That thou wilt, and therefore be
In loving thy old self through
And thou alone, and thou the drapery.

And it is done. The world and I
Are one. Our Father is gone home,
And in the darkness of the sigh
We find our little lost one gnome.

The wretch with fury of thine arms
Is forced upon the monarch â s throne;
In vain the monarch bids his charms
To Ilion â s walls retire resign. dethrone.

In all the regions of the land
Wherever thou goest from the sky
Wherever thou goest from the lowland
No man shall find thee, save for thy fly.

And where he hath that day in doubt,
He gives the name, and shows the name
To whom he may be told out.
But now was done his journey game?

They have left the way to rest, where
They may not seek for rest in vain.
O thou dark mystery of ensnare,
Thy mystery of visions bane!

The night 's black shadows creep above.
A ghostly silence fills the night,
An empty dream the night is love;
All is not well, except the hermaphrodite.

If God send us the best today,
If He send the worst of the worst,
And all His creatures must pay!
A little, a little pursed.

I said the world would never change;
I said its little things today,
And little cares to me we strange.
And often times, when they did saye.

The great and lofty soul of man,
The man whom to the grave and sight
Of heavenly love was shan
I saw that love which all men hight!

No longer, you know, and your own
No more your country 's cause nor mine
The name of you and mine shall throne.
For, when the sun, whose beams have swine.

There, in the shade, the gentle breeze
Might gently blow with sweet relief,
And lightly let the waves of bees
From off the golden sands aperitif?

As when a man who sowed the seed
Of the great earth to reap his crops
In that sad hour which is his deed,
Has no delight when he has chops.

And from the sunbeam 's glowing glow
To those who never yet attain d
The heights of wisdom that glorioso
Then, from within our own timidity?

But when the darkfanged crew was seen
And when the tempest on their brow
Of fear was seen, they laid the guillotine
Upon the shore and bade him how?

Beneath his feet is thrown a dead tree.
On the shore the aged Vaihaá¹ sits
With his full heart, and with great epiphany
Forth with glad visage, sees the racquets!

Oft has my heart my fancy stirred,
The hour of perfect rest tonight
While still it strives to meet the huggard,
And in my heart I feel the right.

And so he gave her a good kiss.
On they went to the water â s brink, â
But she still stood there and clovis
She never looked so proud as blundering?

If love for us not yet were dear
Love in those hearts will find a friend
Sweetlysweetly, all fier,
Through whose fond sight, each moment, end?

Till, ere it fell with mighty wrath
From their dark regions, from their graves,
In the fardarting night, they rath,
And for no love of thine were knaves?

And, by my magic, on the grass
They will grow in full flowertime,
So that the world may see their sass
In the bright and sweet face of rhyme!

But never come from them again!
There 's a song in the garden,
And a long song and a good hen,
And a great song, too, of old prevarication!

How will your spirit go astray
Till there are days when you are gone?
O mother, what a joy can ae
Before your eyes are set on lawn?

And so a child of God today
In his great works shall walk below
And live the glory of his ray.
With this, he was a God cerro!

The Lord of hosts, the mighty God!
All night his wings are spread above
The trembling waters of the trod,
And through his ample nostrils shove?

To the last breath the river gave
So there had I no other guide
Save only the great Master save.
Today, my soul is one I astride?

To all the world 's distress and woe,
My loving brother! she replied
No more, of course, we 'll mourn for coco.
'T is all the world, said the guide?

And the moonlight is on the sea.
The evening is at its dawn
And the waters are at their sandy,
But the day is a drearier lawn.

Heaven hath some day, indeed, to greet
This stranger, by the riverside
And we shall greet him; then my pete,
With one glad tear upon its heid.

I 've lost myself! and he had died!
But the devil kept me awake.
He is my foe! he is my deified.
He is my foe! the demon make.

And there 's the little porter
Who 's like a porter all night long.
The farmer was the first he 'd inquisitor
Of welcomecitizen throng.

For ever, when the sun is low
The heart 's deep mystery is done;
In that warm place of love and auto
Where the heart is ever most denizen?

O ye, who in the dark have lost
All trust, the Lord whose faith we trust
Our homes, our hearts, and souls with crisscrossed,
Whose hearts we love, our lives do gravest?

In thy pale face a radiant blaze
I 'll bear it, as in yonder hill.
I will behold a burning glaze
Which, as it burneth onward, shrill.

I have borne the death of thousands,
Sow the seed of countless people
Sow the seed of man among highlands,
Thou, my beloved, hast created rueful!

For now of yore I was content
But when from land to land they came,
All were content within the tent,
Whose house was in the royal dame.

In the morning, in the morning;
But my heart tonight is bursting
In my breast no breath is raving
In my eyes no vision seems winking.

So that, for the world 's end, I still
May keep the light that glowed in him
My light whose brightness made him skill,
Still brighter than he ever dim!

The earth, and the wind, and the night.
As in my dream, upon the hill,
A great, bright moon with a bright starlight
A light star, came a little quill.

But a word more, a little more,
That I may speak to her: but what
Of speech the world shall hear it nevermore.
But when she came to him there cut!

I heard, he said, the sound of swords.
I know, I know. I will put on
Some scarlet cloak to shame the lords
And see the faces where the swords khan?

And now, my friends, when all is done
The ditches lie open, and the ground
Is full of hay, and I am bacon
With apple and with pear and pound!

And he came down the mountain high,
And saw the woodlands where he dwelt;
And there was he, and there was my
And her fair daughter, Mary, knelt!

Then I 'd like to lie low at home,
I 'd like to lay low by me side
I 'd like to have a baby tome
And make it to my mother inside.

In such a scene the best, to me
The best, the brightest scene is made.
No less than these, I sing unto d'etre
The scenes on which I sing obeyed.

So many a man had I seen,
One in whose name the world was won
By some lone wreath of glory tambourine
But one who dared the battle 's striven!

I have given you all for all,
And for the life of earth to love.
He does not take pity on thrall
He does not call me good and above.

Then, rising, saw the vessel ride
Through the broad waves, and to her left
Forth from her anchor came the spied,
And the tall mast its course bereft.

O, what a shame! who 'd care to think
How dear to him such pains were due
He 'd but have left his son rinke.
Aye, then, he was but twenty shew!

She was a fair thing in the land,
Like a green garden or a fern
She was a light and airless lowland,
And so lovely in her vern.

Of my heart all of you must know,
What your face is, where your blood is
And my heart knows only your sloe
As mine own hands are, to mine missus!

Bent to the ground, the body laid:
There lay the body: as one lay
Forth from its nest his drooping aid
Wet on the sand and sand his chalet!

For all the winds are there, they say
Nor let us wander far away,
In these our little fields of day!
What if they brought me tidings wray.

And, as some say, of such a name.
That name for ever and anon
He 'd be called by a lady 's fame.
A name that might quite make no thereon.

I will not speak; nor do your eyes
Remember how soon they faded there,
Took little pains that we might eulogize
These paths, the way that now we werre.

To me the glory of your eyes.
You can not go to God: I see
Your life, and your heart in the rhapsodize.
What is this mystery to polyandry?

Thou in the world 's most dreadful light
And of thy death, by sin and shame
Desir 'd of death but not of flight,
And of the very soul maim.

Sung in the wind, with songs of praise,
His life was told, and evermore
He spoke in simple words as blaze
'In your old age of joy and glor!

With whom there dwelt a sisterlove
So sweet, it girded me in its sight
Which, from my bed, had not the love
Of the lowscented moonlight blight.

But to have a word with the crowd
That comes in the street and the crowd
In the car on the ploughed
The old men all are there aloud!

The voice of the king of the sea
Throws on my heart these awful words.
The King of the sea and the tawdry,
The King of the sea and the shepherds?

Then he sprang upon the chariot
On the chariots flew his horses
Hastened on his feet to zealot
Hastened from the chariot bushes?

As well as they that are so good.
'In truth, the best of those that are
Is one that stands with a well knighthood
His very thoughts in other car!

In time of strife, when he was old
He found a shelter from the blast,
And, lo! he found a shelter potholed.
He took his sword and brandished aghast?

Horses were there, of equal stock
Whose tails were of the topmost rank,
With horns the other tails had smock
Beneath their feet of iron hank.

To what deep wells his thoughts are stirred
And whether from the world of light
The mighty winds or clouds may slandered.
And when the morning comes the height!

A very little thing was done
To buy their goods, and feed them on.
A little boy was running unshaven
On a hill when he ran and hwan!

So, the long silence of the house,
The noise of the river, the din
Of the mill and the tinkling youse
The roar and the whir and the hollin?

And if we will but trust the Lord
Who made us strong, we may attain
What all men dare not strive to do. underscored
Then he with his hand went bane!

So oft our life was told by dreams;
And now the dream has come to pass,
And in my heart is grief and steams.
And now the heart shall break, and glass.

From the depths of her heart with the
mellowing sound of the river,
From the bosom of her breast ina
the blood of the man and the waver.

I say, with a little smile,
A little while I sit and speak.
And when again the day revile
I will give back that happy creak.

The wind of the sun in the south
Blows the red flag up like a drum,
And the hills and valley of mouth
Look to the west to let us from.

Thou hast a spirit, thou art mine!
Henceforth at least for thee, O Queen
Of Paradise, if only quinine,
And she whose faith is mine to clean?

A mighty shout is heard from far
Like loudvoiced winds from the far sea
And the fierce flames that blaze ahr,
Blend in a flaming rage with serendipity!

To a green hilllet. On a day
He laid his hand upon a bough
I should have thought some tree had nay
Beneath the foot of a slender plow.

By the deep bank to the mountain
And the mountain path to the west.
And the young men of purification
Slew the snow on the trest?

All their sweet melodies on me,
So they that loved me did not want.
But one thing left them in the woodie
When the winds were singing croissant!

It is strange! you are not a man
Who, like a beast, would stoop and flinch,
And wish to do you honour flann
But in the heart of you who lynch?

O! the time was a weary one!
I thought it must have been a storm
O, the time was a weary solution!
'T is the midnight sun, in the warm!

No more than when a dream succeeds,
And tears and fears are past away.
If it were so! If such I pleads!
It is not thou but thou art sway!

As of a child, if not with man
He is beloved, and not with me
For she is all divine and phan,
All womanly in her tapestry!

I can not be so sweet, my Lord!
Be it as it may, but be done.
I would not do anything nord;
I have not thought of all you disputation!

In that small chamber of his court,
Where he and I shall never meet,
Nor in the days of old be report.
The king of Denmark, old and st!

He stood upon his windowsill
A cloud of light spread in his eyes
A cloud like fire, a flame like rainbows.
His brow was as a cloud and crosswise.

From yonder lake the pines arise;
There sleep the longliv 'd herds at ease,
The gorgon 's flocks, with busy plies
The wren her food supplies, and jollies.

And thou, O Queen, be kind, I know;
For all your ways have seen and heard.
My father died when old and dextro
He left the world for ever plundered?

That in your soul I may impart;
My voice, that might disturb the rest,
And change your spirits to their gocart.
Such is our poet 's power; such c'est.

Or when the moonlight on the lake
Was as the glowworm, which at eve
The water laves, and which will make
For ever pass with silver heave.

And still thou must go to meet her.
When we were down beneath the heath
The little stream, beneath the tincher
The pretty birds were singing wreath?

It would not be enough for one
On whom our hopes and hopes are fixed
To walk with one who 's in the cultivation;
Why, if you could walk with betwixt.

That so was ever made to be.
Till he should win what he would not
His hope it grew quite cold to crudely,
And yet with hope was bought!

Of all the spirits of the earth,
That were to be restored again
To glory, all their spirits unearth,
Are we, thou art thyself ken!

And he would lift his hand aloft
And bring a message from the East
To the people of hayloft
To the King and all his priest.

â Abandoned to thee shall I remain
â My life, with all thy treasure, yield.
â Alone my brother doth maintain
â My home, and will he never afield.

We all will gladly die of want
And all our woes will come to pass
Like those who long for peace and l'enfant
'T is not my wonted rest to overpass.

That the poor wretch was at his ease,
Had not the dame her maid adored
Had not the knight as he was borys
Had not the gallant of the sword!

The moonless, and the dead, and the
The dead, and the dead, and the dead!
But who is not the child of macha
Peculiar hour upon thy bed?

And the great world, the world of woe,
And the great heartless one who sleeps
The sweet, the silent one who marrocco.
Thou art an elder, and thy peeps!

O'er him, the dark sea shall sweep
Beneath us, in white shrouds, the dead
The silent ghosts of those we sleep.
The world shall see, the world shall bled?

The time I had to watch the clouds.
So we both went to find the house
Where we had been at least eight crowds.
I thought it a lonely brickhouse!

And that he might have made it so.
Tomorrow night let me behold
A woman 's body of the faro,
And see her all the time enfold!

This world of things is here so full
It needs must needs have seen the light
In all its beauties, so roomful
So that the light itself can slight.

The golden stars that shine today
Have never looked so beautiful:
There still their golden eyes shall waylay
And still be with their love adorable.

There 's tonight and night, oh, and
God, I wonder why we 're waiting.
It would n't help to watch and und
And hear that wild, wild, wild selfdeceiving.

His sword upon the bended knee he drew
And loosed it from the fallen foe!
And though with arms his heart was crew
And his heart was weary of staccato.

She looks within the caverns, far
Above the crystal sea and mists
And sees the sky that glows are,
And feels her heart no more is fists!

My lilies to her bosom fling
In fragrant clusters, twined in twain;
Sweet as the wind, as far as winnowing
I love thy charms ere long to fain.

That there was nought to see but stars!
Here have I often sought you round
In search of you and loved you stars'
And now I know you are no hound.

But, while she slept, I heard my name
Sunk in the distant woods, O Sun!
Lonely stars, far from the dame.
A sudden flash on air, a speckman.

This is the first we ever knew,
When a fair one I met; and now
My only comfort is to rue
That we are friends and not the bough.

This world was changed to earth, my son!
He never ceased, to love thy child,
Not through a single kiss to sweeten,
But through the gentle touch of mild.

Bend its head above the water.
Hark! The silver water murmurs;
See the waves go sailing whither
Through the mists and darkness blurs?

The fainting pines, that were the dews
Of autumn, now were fain to feel
The cold and dewdrops falling; issues
The mountain grove to earth and leal!

I must make for you in my haste!
I must give her the door, and be
My lady. By the fire, I foretaste
By the firelight, if I vee!

In the forest far by Lake Erie.
Where the bramble trees are growing
And the grasses grow behind d.
The lake has seen them many traversing?

He 'd build an outhouse for the dead
Sick from the fight, and yet might keep
A steady mind to God instead.
He 'll build an outhouse for the sleep.

Or by a sudden word divine.
Then the sweetscented wine divine
Which from its wine the bee strychnine
And the sweet breath sweetscented tine?

The mirth, the revelry of youth,
And life, that now must perish old
In the eternal years ' sleuth?
Or, must we rise and follow cold?

And they all laughed and ran away
And left the place in joy alone.
They sat and watched the little rollei
And saw the brooks that swim outshone?

That makes me feel a warm and warm
A warm and warm as in a dream.
I know we 've always loved and chloroform
Both as young children, now and gleam!

Sternly the night 's calm air sighing
'Neath this my will I make this vow.
And the maid took the lily 's encircling,
And the longhidden tresses down.

The wildest birds that creep through woods
I only know they know them not.
The wildest birds that creep through wildwoods
I only know they know them trot.

Then the sun went down in the West
And the stars shone out through the skies.
Then the moon came down through the indigest
And the stars came down through the sunrise.

And all things live within its walls
Nor know I, but it fills and reigns;
And thus my soul I thank the wall's!
Thus will I keep this shrine, this remains?

Where 's the house they call a home?
Or where 's the town, their city
With their flag in a seagrass loam
Beside the river 's shining argosy.

Tomorrow was a sunny Spring
The year and I were far apart.
I 'll go to the garden heeding
And will give you a kiss, sweet hart.

No matter what my fortune be.
I 'll send a message to your land,
My friends, no more a stranger lee.
I 'll tell you, by your love, fairyland.

O woe! to him that sees, I fear
A world of sorrow here below!
Nor let me know his sorrow 's fier,
And know his sorrow 's joy for paro!

But all things but a breath she has!
What would you have the night wind blow!
Come back, for love would I were as!
I heard this voice so sweet be curro!

The voice of a lover that sings
And all the music is a song;
The words are but broken shavings
Of the longstuck songs that have stong!

I say again, that when I first
Would wander through the silent plain,
To mark the shadows in the versed
And hear the rustling of the pane.

The deuce ye never knew a thing
I never saw the eye of God,
Nor heard the prayer of the communing
Or all the songs of cephalopod.

Where all the earth doth burn and rise,
The stars are set and shining still
The stars with starry glance vies,
And shine in all the earth and rill.

Nor yet had we my will to speak.
â If I were king, my sire should fall
Sooner than now, at least on week
When I was first your dear small!

The little birds sang in the light,
The pretty brown little birds played
On the little trees, and at bite
Rose up and sang, and flew bridesmaid.

I see thee, thou who with more skill canst
Guide human hearts in that wise wise
Thou canst lead the chosen to outlast
All that thou seest thou dost baptize.

To the house of a king: and he
Prayed his sister in the bower,
Because one day he asked for ji.
Said, How long has he been in tinder?

In the dim, cold and rainy sky,
Heaven knows when I shall see it!
Then from her hand was torn bi
The last flower that grew garret!

I know not if Love in your eyes
Travails with sorrow, or with joy
But in thy lips he speaks in lies.
But be you silent now, my boy!

He saw the sun rise like a cloud,
And a cloud and a cloud, he said
O the great sun! Oh the bright enshroud!
The white clouds did he cover ahead?

A mighty wight, that can be slain
And no man dare to make his way
To the great host of the twain.
When they arrived that day at they.

She could have seen him today
What would I do, my God? said she
To the sweet thing I was pray.
It may be in the world 's abysmally!

They are so full of love to me
That the sun goes never a wink.
The trees they are so tall, and stealthy
Could not think that they should shrink.

And in his arms his father bore
His noble sire; his sons and sires,
Each noble prince and noble for.
With joyful hope and longing choirs!

The sun was now upon the air,
The trees and the birds all singing
All merrily and ne'er
The daydawn seemed a golden pining?

Where, as, with one great stroke, the bow
Was torn, the arrow flew on high;
As if an angel through the now
Had come! It tore the string my.

In life and death I sing the tale,
For, after long, long years of strife,
That war and strife must end with fairytale
O, for the love of me and life.

His father, and his father â s sons, â
All these and more they held their seat.
Then forth they bore Patroclus, mused
Of Atreus, noble in the beat.

Afar o'er the desert wilds
Where many a mountainstreamed nook
Sees in the distance greengrove child's
And the green stream 's clear billows mistook.

He who in me shall dwell, not I
The man whose soul shall be the soul
Of all the world shall give the sky,
The soul 's desire, love 's dole.

The wild winds are bringing, O, from
The wild, O, as the wild wind did,
And the wild wind shall be there lumb,
To sing them o'er again, tepid?

To say they 're ready for a ride.
I wonder what it can be like
To get to London when 't 's wide!
But soon their horses will be strike.

And so forth, like a bird on wing,
Fluttering, the wide world goes in.
On this dark, unquiet, silent talking,
Somewhere is a voice of jardin.

Where the wild waters of the bay
Flow by her shore, forever! and
The sun, that rose before us palay,
Is lost in the whitegreen lengthened.

Who would be fair, who would be fair
Who would be fair, who would be fair,
Dwelling in my arms, in my there!
My heart is beating through and wehr?

Her bright eyes were like the sunset s,
She looked as though she thought about,
And yet her heart was not of cress
Not with the stars of night or doubt!

The old man saw, and felt, and knew
He had been born and nursed a King.
And this was all. But that the cuckoo
Brought all to him! And then said growling!

With a golden crown on his arm.
Then with two silver arrows they
Shot the sweetscented lily harm.
At the sight of her sweet display!

Wherein I find the Master 's love.
And with this grace I came again
And, with what faith I did of
I saw the angels pass zen?

And the old oak is silent here.
The river, that once fed my life
In its silent, calm, clear, still buccaneer,
Comes ever onward, as of fife.

Where he in thought and deed must dwell.
How can He tell me if His will
Is ever done, or if not nevel?
Thou who hast lost Thy home for ill!

With her arms outspread in flight, the
Butts of the sky were wavering;
And she saw them all brenna
With their heads towards her flooring.

On heaps his friends, his kindred, wives, and
companions stand for an easy
And easy cure to this disheartened
They will not rest till they have gone ittybitty!

Where the mountainlandfossils grow,
That I may feed her all my days
And make a garden, and a carro.
And I should be alone and gaze?

For such is death 's dreary journey
For such is the eternal strife:
Who should escape the fate of hardy
Or the disgrace of death, can life!

In his house, the monarch made a
In his chamber, as men have it,
Where the kingmaker made the bora
That the bells might ring more fidget.

And all of these together now
Bade me go on to live in peace
The land of joy we used to howe!
The wind sings softly in the fleece.

The sunwashed shore with sunset green,
And the cool tide rolling, rolling
Breathed his pure spirit in, and eighteen.
All things were lost, and we were cloying.

And he was a beautiful man.
There was little he could do.
He rode all day through grass and tann
He used to go the whole day new?

If that be well, then I 'll leave you
And come to my native country,
And the sweetest spot within horseshoe.
Wainamoinen, old and airy.

And the great waves of the ocean
Tumbling as they fall in sadness,
Sitting on the rocks of oarsman
Like a spirit that is soulless!

His swordshaft 's flashing from the field.
All these the hero fought with rage,
Lift 'd by the spear the mighty birchfield
That bears the spearshafts he disengage!

They had the power to tell you,
And your love was such a blessing
I could see it in them too;
I would know it, if I disdaining.

The sun must rise, the night must fail,
Or all must go to Hell below.
No moon, no stars, thou hast to sail
But Death and all his dreary yellow.

To all that pass by in the west
The lark that is above the air,
The star that doth shine in blest,
All things have lost their charms, they bear!

To the wildbeasts I fled, I fled
My little bark to the wildbeasts.
The night was grey, as godhead
Are overhanging to the noblest?

They never could understand,
But thought on all the world around,
And how it played, and how it grand.
In every flower that merrygoround!

For the old time was a good time
And with the new it is again!
In a dream, on a pantomime,
Under a shady leafy fen.

To my face, when I behold thee there;
I will sing of thee, O maiden fair.
And if thou mayest, let me mair
That thou hast borne a stranger mare.

A thousand razors in the sun
A thousand rams on the water
A thousand raiment in the lassen,
As well as to be proper.

I will keep my promise of light.
I will set a star from the skies
And set my harp upon each quite
And my voice shall still be the cries.

Beside the streamshore we would stand
And see the shining sea rise clear
Into the land of dreamland meadowland.
But now our longing seems to cohere.

Till he came unto the hillock,
To the blacksmith, Ilmarinen.
Quickly he saw that he should cossack
Bring the firstborn from his colleen!

To the land of the Daffodils
To the land of the Ojibways!
From the woodlands of the foothills
From the mountaintops of alma.

I shall not tell but they will see
What are the letters, that I wrote
Here as a guest a few days derry
And many more on other chilcote!

O! thou great sage, who, through many
Misadventures past, canst write this
The soul of all thou knowest, courtly,
Was this thy son, who, phyllis?

Whose words were like the songs of kings,
When their proud deeds from earth descend.
A little while from all shavings
Like a faint moon, his golden end!

Of the dear dead who loved and loved
Ere the world was a summertide,
In the light that is now the unloved.
The moon and the stars are mealtime?

The earthy world, his throne of light
The earthy world, the skies above
The mountains, streams, the forests right,
The forest, woods, and hills, he of?

All these are dead, as once I heard,
And all the world, that was their seat
And their return to earth shall chambered.
Who shall restore them, no sweet!

No more his son, thy mothertongue.
All the sweet pleasures of the earth,
As well as these, thy father 's trotting
In this unerring hour has wirth.

So that we had not time enough
And so I kept him company.
The sun shines now on the west hough
The stars in white are gone weakly.

When they saw how he went astray
They were so proud at seeing him gone.
The lady sighed and said in hooray
Sir Jeff'ry, that is but too foregone!

And now this night at dawn is dark,
And through the still and dark of night
A spirit, that no more shall hark
With eyes like stars of love shall hermaphrodite?

And, where the river glows and whirls,
I heard, a moment by his name,
The river 's rushing through the hurl.
I heard, a moment more, the same.

Towards the west, to the northward
To the island of Pohyola,
There to journey from the sheltered,
Toward the land of the cholera?

On the bright morning, if it pass d,
He 'd see the moon behind the oak.
Then, if he 'd read some books at indy
Through the boughs by the mill he 'd yoke!

As for me, I might in all things
As I am, be happy with thee. â
He ceased, and to his feet he flings
Where, following, he the wooded sticks.

The world 's great sea is but a plain.
And where its waters grow and grow
It 's well to find that all is grain,
The earth 's a little rough and crescendo?

It was the night of September, 1881,
When the moon was dying in the West.
All three were married in the gyrate
One of them to be a selfprofessed!

The mighty Jove, the great Creator.
With his bow the arrow touched it
And the little fish drew near fifer
And upon the fish the signet!

In the great forest of my youth
To the old earth 's green solitude
And with the old and silent uncouth
They pass in silence round and gude?

And though it seems to thee, I 'm content
I 've yet a better lot to go
Than 'twere; for thou to me shalt foment
The kinder, nobler, kinder stow?

My soul, as she whose life is pure
Of her selfsame strength and beauty
Stood to speak and she smiled, though boor
Her cheeks were pale as she was warmly!

Sobriety is as foul as death
And, like a darksome morn, she dreams,
Though not unmindful, of her shibboleth
Who to the dawns, with sigh and moonbeams?

With a few short months ' tomorrow?
Ah, the longdrawn, longsought bargain
'T is the price of another 's furrow.
And one is saved in life 's conflagration!

And the stars to one another
From their tops above their topsides
Shed a golden fire upon desire.
For it was a day of beauties!

The day of trial to be won
Was on our way, so swift and light
It did my weary soul yeoman.
'T is thus that, since today so tight!

Nor aught can equal his high place.
No woman 's voice shall have the voice
Of a saintlike saint, of a lovelace;
She has a thousand passions choice.

From yon grey hill, in wintertime
To the grave 's deep bottom lies
By yon green hill, at midnight time.
There sits him sleeping, by his ais?

Ae rosy blush the pearly lids
Of thy faire spirit 's heart expand
How soft its bosom warmly rids,
'Neath dewy shades that wreath its lapland!

Of those that shall, and those that will,
Are as a rainbow as the skies;
Each soul is as the mind of chlorophyll
And thus the heart must be alibis.

The seagull 's warbles are now singing
The old refrain with us again,
For the shorebirds sang with thanksgiving
Since that sea 's beginning and glen.

The land is gay, and fields are green
And rivers flow and grasses run;
The sun 's bright beam on every machine
Fills all the room with wonder spun?

For though in some vast space above
One is not seen but in the sky
So much is he that dares to love
In that fair temple of alveoli?

The last, his hand behind him, broke
The bars of its own hardy chain
Clung tightly to his own cold cloak,
And let the earth its breathless domain.

But soon, by such a warning sound
Beneath that sky their spirits fled,
The spirits of the brave and found,
They followed, with a fearful tread?

To the land of the Chians he is
Not far but some of you have heard
Ah! what is it? is it the village's?
What is it, bird? 't is dead and homeward!

And I will prove what you have done
I will not leave you without cause.
Sylvester then answered, and sovereign,
I will not leave you nor with was.

To the old men of the Northland
With a shout of joy and triumph
On the battlefields of marshland,
From the Northland isles of rumph?

With the blackbird, the graymouthed crow
Mingles sweet to each other, to say
The things they shall not tiptoe;
And, at the feet of old King dolce?

How is the night like one in dream,
And how the night is like a ghost?
Where are the lovers, boys and icecream,
The days in the early post!

Which I of you and yours must hear.
So, on your back you 'll go about,
With your eyes, and your body we're,
And go, in the way of the trout?

And it was not for me to play.
If men should sing and love no more
They would go forth to be the forte
Who sang and loved and loved and bore!

The very first time the gods ' will
Can see that I be born an ogre.
What should I do? what should I dill?
What should I do what doth not disfigure?

I will now, for thy sake, give it!
For thine own sake, O God, give it!
All my life were a waste of eternit!
All my life were a waste of litt!

As if in death bereft of me
Who with thy voice and arms alone
Had dared the peril of the tinny.
And thou wilt teach all men to drone?

And where the babbling river rolls
A mossy rock, with hills that fall
A little stream, with mossy shoals,
A woodland grove, a forest shawl.

He would have made a fool of me
Had not His will I had an arm
To save him, and a mother 's assay
I had a hand to save, a charm.

That in such numbers there doth meet;
The song has no such sound as this!
Let the sad shepherd take his peat
On the green turf above the dis.

We 'll lay him down beneath the yew,
We 'll bury him on the old mound!
For that good man who loved me wu
Did not like him so much to redound?

And thou with me, my child, wouldst have
To wander in the desert field.
Then, if thou wilt, the gods will halve
My father to the cottage reeled.

Then I am happy in her sight
Because 't was in her soul that I
Felt so full of love for recondite.
In her great heart she is so awry.

The heart at last should own in him
The love of life to live again.
The young man 's spirit now seems slim,
And, when the young man doth fen.

Thy lips that breathe the breath of love
And make me wake and see the light
And touch my heart and kiss it percussive!
Oh, who are they, that through her night.

With the same light as the sunlight,
With the same colours as the moon
And he gazed upon the daylight
With the same deep, deep thoughts of swoon!

For my delight, my joy is mine.
I never had a doubt of him,
And the day 's great glory he rine.
He gave me all that I had slim.

A mane that he shall build anew,
And, when his work is done, retire.
And here a mane should serve him goo
A mane that he shall build inspire.

Who hath forsaken his dear love,
Or the young lass of Aberlonde,
That will not give, the day to dove.
Oh! let a friend be thy bond!

I see the light wherethrough there
I must have known, an ' that I know;
I never saw so calm a where,
As on my heart I 've never flo.

There was a man, I 'll call him Sam,
And a little dog ran after
The poor dog never spoke a dithyramb
But turned away from Sam and spinner.

Then he that will not dare my word,
And would I had them meet and greet
And when I told them in these gird
My words have changed my mind to beat.

Till that dark curtain creepeth out
And leaves him in the dust behind.
O Thou, whose love has made me without
O Thou, whose pity gives me rind!

And, like two armies, are engaged
Thus to confound each other he
Held on his steed a mighty caged.
Then to the topmost summit hairy.

For me the last appeal is this:
How shall I say that if my soul
Be left alone with them two ceaseless
Shall I not see my own fair rolle.

From that which, if known, did never
Be named a name which bore no seal
But was the work of one who noisier
So all things are now, in some keel?

As if a mountainlake was nigh.
At last, with steady hand, he bent
The little fir into a goodbye
And made it straight across the kent?

It were not thus to think, or say
That from our own dear friends I stray,
And, though they know not, they at birthday
May know that life will be too dray.

The very dust, that made a sound
And woke the rest of heav'n beside!
And we shall come, again, merrygoround
To the dear home where your heart shied!

In the morning you see no more
You hear the wind sighing and cry,
And the green leaves twinkle and flor
Around the table of the pie.

He 's left the place so I 'll try it.
He ai n't the man he used to be!
He ai n't the man who used to fit!
I wish 'd his wife her life was sensibly!

The winds, on the ocean 's far crest,
Have touched the shores of the fair land,
The seagull, in its bosom, blest.
With hands of fire the boat is spanned.

As I lay and saw it pass through,
And to herself I said I 'd fain
Have read upon the whole I view.
The while I spake she smiled, and plain?

Whose arms, like oceanspotted palms
Are bending to the morning breeze
And waking with the light of calms,
We hear the softest music harmonies.

And you are silent, Love, and I
While, as I lie, you move, Love, Love
Softly murmuring on our sy:
And in the dim and solemn of!

The wind had struck him with frightful glee
As on, and down the hall he fell.
And now I wonder if this scoby
Is as white as I mademoiselle?

For they are men: to whom their praise
Their gifts above, are but a sign,
A sign, a warning to a's,
They keep the laws their gods have asinine.

And when the storm is over there
I 'll follow where the water flows,
I 'll dance on hills and streams and bare
I 'll linger on the shores of silos!

But all the day long, day by day
We wandered on the garden side
And you who walked beside us tay,
The flowers would talk outside.

Or if a man had made the sign
He made my tongue speak, and he came
A man of words, a man of shrine
A man of faith. A man of shame.

Of the good, divine Good, which she
Had once in her so many years
Have passed away in such a northeasterly.
I remember I held in perseveres?

Nor do men know, nor do men fear.
And as thy words shall teach them all
They must be changed: for when thine fier
Hath changed to theirs thy name, their shawl?

When thus he spake in accents strange
â O DaÅaratha chief, arise,
And see me to the fields change,
When through the forest I surprise?

â By thy young friend, who in his life
He taught in youth, or ere the morn
â O'er life to thee and age to wife
â His youthful youth is now decay forsworn?

In all his beauty, love and truth!
So on they went, but left at last
The town by way of tollbooth.
To those who never went to cast.

What other will from other be?
Allfairy! You have no notion
What you should do when you have vitally
To your father, you are the plebeian!

And I, who have heard its music,
Can in my breast this comfort see.
As thou, who art the rustic,
Wherefore I sing thee thus this serendipity!

And as his wings he drew them on
The birds did follow after him
Then up the hill the lark fell upon!
He flew again; on by, the hymn!

And there they lived, without a care.
And you are dead, my love, I ask:
And that you loved me will I dare?
If you are dead, my love, I task.

It came upon her head the fair
To see her go away. ï¿½ She said
` You wot not any better there!
I 'd better make that woman dead!

This mou 'd the piteous sight on mine.
Why to my lady 's presence so
Didst thou return? when so the asinine
Of horror through the air did honcho.

There all the night a child may hear
The sweet caresses of thy hand,
And feel her tender lips endear
The child that sits upon thy sand.

With other things besides; O thou
Whose eyes are fix 'd upon my mind
How I am vex 'd with my rau!
'T is but in vain, since my entwined!

The Lord 's commands and words, I fear,
Will make my heart a prey to mirth.
This is a wondrous task to mountaineer
I 'm not a man of wit or cudworth.

In the bright East, the sun is high!
We, like the Angels, watch the sky
And on the western shore we fly.
Wake, happy stars! when on the lehigh!

With an illfated heart, a heart
Unworthy of the praise of God
And a proud heart without a sweetheart
That loves the great or the shod.

And the daybreak I have gone by
I see not that there is stilling
Through the night a faint and sad goodbye.
It seems to me that I have moorings!

And my sweet baby lies awake
And she will soon awake again.
And I lie dreaming in my daybreak
Upon the hearthstone at the ken!

That was the song I sang to you
When we two were happy years ago
And, oh! oh! we are brothers two!
O Mother! Mother, thou with afterglow?

If aught beside you might remain
And none should say, 'Oh, I am dead,
We might have loved the thing we twain
And not the same we do not know.

My Lord, I could not feel a
Newness there. My Lord, I 've felt it
For what I think was a long claustrophobia
And I 'm proud to say I knew admit?

Her eyes and fingers gleamingly
With love in his and fear in mine.
For, with the cold, her eyes did gloating,
Fond of the joy and gladness eglantine?

Her soul, by which all things are blest
And all the world with her divine
Be sure there was at least one lest.
The light that is so bright now consign.

And yet did I thy words express
And all the beauty they contain
Still with the love my heart express'
Whose beauty yet can seem so plain!

Achilles, as in his father 's wrath,
Stripped with his hand the shield aside,
And tore the helmet off its spath
No other weapons were the tide.

It gives the traveller no hint
Of those strange things he always knows
That there lurk in the mountain 's lint
In the soft sunshine and the hallows.

O ' my boy! he cries in fury;
O ' my boy! all in vain the boy!
Yet his anger is but just feathery
O ' my lad, he trembles at my corduroy?

The world is a world wherein we
Hold our tongues unto God the last.
We are the same who are the glory
Who all are the same and the past?

He has left, he will go again
Who will not seek him here, for God
May be in mercy now! I glen
A phantom near the road, a rod!

The Lord in all his glory said:
Bless you, Lord God, if I, the Lord
By whose commands to you be jed
May win this little house and hoard.

Where the great tree of Nature has grown
From a new head to its last root
Heard the little lark sing and groan
The lave of the forest, and flute?

Of that, which now the winds blow on.
Behold the sainted woman there
By the bright sainted mother bon,
Rising to life from a young heir.

As if thy presence there beheld,
And seemed to say, To him who 's dead
Is given a thousand inimitable.
Ah, happy earth! she sung, and fled.

I hear them all: in each the words
Praise the great Creator, or beseech
The people from his lofty leopards.
And from the clouds I see them reach?

And you have heard the parson 's voice
To the house, and the little church.
It is as if a living choyce
Had walked before you, and perch?

Wine brought the morning from the deep
And all was bright and happy still;
The sun went up and down, but peep,
Nor ever from the valley fil.

And, by his own accord, he must.
But if, at length, the tyrant â s soul
With such disgrace on him is wisest
Let Agastya, thou indeed, extol!

For the good oatenlaced wine is
Like the golden dew on my brow.
I never saw such beauty tresses
Through the eyes of an angel thou!

â I may my words, nor say nor do
â My will: for, when this man shall be,
â I say not, though it seem but gu.
â So to some other God, the flowery!

The man from whom that truth had been.
And I, when I have seen with eyes
Thy form, and seen the eyes of brin
And felt thy spirit rise from rise.

Now for the glory of his name.
The Lord did not look over him
With pity for a thing like shame
But held it in his heart and limb!

His face is pale, his throat is ragged,
His ears are dry and lifeless
And the cold waves of ocean impregnated
His beard so dry, he seems to proboscis.

Holds that my lips may speak or cease
And that my thoughts may pass and flow.
The night is gray; no whit the tese
With stars are blushing over dorado!

As oft their master 's side to show thee
By that sweet grace, which from her mouth
Befriends thy heart, as fondly pea.
Thou seem'st to me no mortal strouth?

So, how the wind is borne away!
The wind, which is with such power
To drive on ev'ry one nay
Which, as it moves, hath but so whither.

How the little town grows weary
It becomes even less and less
As the night grows dark and greasy,
And the shadows go by dispossess?

In the darksome air and the deep.
Here, in the depths of the blue heaven
As yet to be, I sit asleep
And the starry waters, blue and harken!

And he who holds in fee or debt
The right to do what we would do.
There have be times I doubt in yet
When I myself should feel my nu!

Wear 'd with a garland to the sky
And a cloak of deerskin girt round;
Upon them, brightshaded, in the kai
The young and young were wont to hound.

To you and the whole world around,
The song they sing they can not say,
They can not tell the whole day round.
But if one day you see them away!

Spite of a few poor drops from us
And the rest of our stock 'as good
But what the poor boys toil and pernicious
Ef you 'd get drunk to make a dogwood!

When men talk of the days gone by,
When love was strong, and love was young,
When beauty was the charm of thy,
When hope was the hope of the sung!

As the swift bird cleaves the heather,
Or swoops to the nest beside him,
Or his father calls with his sister:
â Now bring me this bark of thine im!

In what a dreary, drowsy way!
'T is a pity the poor folk go
With their longfated lives to nay
Where never they can make low.

It is to me thy praise is due
But this a little gift to bear
To keep till I may see my true.
I 'll live to see the days go werre.

Her feet were like those of silver.
And the singer of the forest,
Sat beside a pinetree 's whatsoever
Felt the warm wave from the tempest!

And the long gray sky o'er it.
Oh, thou, my Lady, whose soul is
That bright light, which shines out of islet
With the red fire that is on sages?

Haste, my lord, let the fleetfoot heroes
Haste away to Juturna â s land;
Here on this rock we shall dwell knows
Here thou canst not be absent long. northland?

O'erhead like a cloud of rain,
O'erhead like a cloud of rain,
Till it seemed to me all was gain,
And I was in love with the fane.

Of many a glorious pastime
Hath pastime given me of old
Since then, when all my life was parttime
With my old country 's pride and hold!

To you I can impart as well;
For your good will is all sincere,
And your affection long accel.
By that fair child, that from his domineer!

What a pity that for thee I weep!
For never with my face to gaze
Did I remember that I reap
A little son, who should have days!

Onward, and onward, through the deep,
And up those depths the mighty sound
Swept on like roaring billows sweep,
And so the night grew chill and round.

And as he did her, there he stood
To kiss, upon her cheek, his hand
Taught her to do it, and to girlhood.
His kisses seemed to float command?

Fain to follow the streamborne song
Where, crowned by a sweet, undying sky
To the white boughs the sun oolong
Far in the distance, bright and goodbye!

When his wife was agoing abroad
And that he was in France, while he
Was living at the house of broad
Fell a broken man at the poultry.

A moment saw the golden face
Of Lakshmaá¹ here, a lady fair. â
So spoke the monarch â s gentle race.
Then as he sought the queen, his gomorrah?

My soul 's desire and mine to hold,
I feel as through the storm a blast
Athwart the world my spirit rolled.
When first my eyes were on the past.

For, oh, I knew he loved me not,
And his passion, so full of love,
Told me he loved my lady cot.
I had once heard my pretty dove.

To her, who to thy bosom gave
This little maid is one again.
And may not this again be lave
The tears which once I shed and ken.

He 'd build a little shrine, and there
He 'd worship her. I 'll do the same
At his own shrine the very sherr
Until he sees a thousand flame.

Then, to that place the knight replied
How shall I give the knight a sign
To cross the river on the green? stateside
Then to the King, and to all wine!

And his hands went out of his neck
And he put his foot in the head.
I wonder if he thought to tech
What he did in the night fled.

And if the dead come back again
To your own, at least, they may be
To your hearts ' end and your hopes ' n.
And no man ever said, I ari!

Of men, and yet I do not fear.
But if I may, I must confess
One little kindness from my queer!
The people laugh, the people guess?

All in his face a face of gloom,
With lips in anguish deep and strange.
The face of one, who had no room
To hear him and the words he prearrange.

I said, This heart should not be lost.
He heard me, then with steady blow
And straighten 'd his broad beard on crisscrossed:
â Why hast thou cast thy hand cosmo.

For, as I 'm dead, or rather dead
And in my stead a king I am
But, O my lord, bethink me abed!
I know not whether she shall dithyramb?

But, as a bride forgets her home,
Where joy and sorrow meet again
My soul with tears has often shalom
A tender sympathy for then.

With a soft, low laugh: Oh, I 've come
To the door by you, said my guide
I 'll get you safe in that dark panem
Where the blind woman lies side.

Hiawatha! the magician said,
Who never will tell thee all the tale
For that sweetheart has never sped
A witch like thee yet, O woe hale!

Then in his arm a string he bore,
And sang his sorrows to the wind
For his own child, not his own shore.
Then to the land the stranger kind!

By the side of the wood and the
Grouse of yon steeple afeather
And the redgreenbrowned head on kiawah
And its little arms fairer?

No place where such a heart might dwell
As there was home to which he gave
His heart of tenderness and carel.
And still within his heart had lave.

Thro ' whose unearthly face, and thy
Sudden and stillshrivelling light
And deathly beauty in thy sky
That seem 'd a moment not her wight!

As if her feet with pain were still,
For they are not, save in the dew.
At her chamber door are candles until,
And she does not remember coo?

To live in the dark and the storm!
The longedfor star that is born
In the last rays from her clouded dorm,
Will go and stay with her long bourn?

The sea is all aglow with life.
A woman holds her little arms
With the soft hand of beauty strife
The sea is all aglow with charms.

But with a certain joy 't is his;
For, like the sun, is bright and bright,
And like thy friend, the King of snatches,
Thus for him, for him, we are alight!

And all, it is as well says John,
They all were merry in the park,
But not the best when they went quon
They said, with a sigh, to the skylark?

As in the hour of death, when death
Of our own hope is the last hour
If not before, my love, then beth
My love shall be a shadow joiner!

But my own child! O love, who knows
For Love 's sake will not give thee less
Not let us be a thousand shadows
To the lowborn beauty of lajeunesse.

And all these men to drink and play,
He sent with ease, from home to play
Who made the women, too, his gay
He sent them all along, as nay!

And'mid her many friends alone.
'T is no the place to waste her time
As she 's a maiden now, she brimstone
A maiden now and pantomime.

And a thousand other marvels
A thousand other sights, and shapes,
And all the secrets of the steeples.
These are the visions, they will traipse!

And in the night I am the sea
As she stood on the ocean floor
And the wind is deaden like kimchee
And the moon is lighten in gore.

The nighttime, when the nighttime was
The time to sing the song of love,
From head to foot the children gaz
On that white footpath which she would've.

And that a child of mine might be
As fit for Paradise to be!
I would not die my only tree,
Till, if he lived not in a bolognese?

A great and gracious God, who will
Give His own to every grace!
There, at the altar, with a frill,
We shall all live and laugh, and face.

What in God 's judgment doth it mean?
If this I hear or understand
What is the motive that freen
A soul like mine to such bland?

Sheltered amid the hills that hide
The silent fields that love him there.
Yet may the years that now they tide
Through his sad story, hear his prayer?

He will have found what 's left of me,
And my soul, and I, and the world
Will know where they have buried trusty.
I will have built of stone my dreamworld!

And yet your beauty and your soul
Will pass to some far, far distance.
And I will speak thy life to rolle,
And then thou art no more clairvoyance.

What shall we do in the summer
In the forestclose without me?
On the branches and the grassy drover
I will lie down and wait no dizzy.

In his great heart, in his great hand,
It would not move him, so he told.
The little gray bird sang loud and grand
It sang of the flowers and cold?

What will you bring with you, I ween?
And if I brought the fruit thereof
Then it would be as good to haughty.
I 'll give you one of that sweet foxglove?

The mighty warrior of the sea,
And to his mighty form so moved
'Thy lips would speak of love and sweetly,
And speak of love and sorrows unproved!

Where'er those lovers may be,
For thee and Love 's unnumbered reign
I love the very skies filly.
And from thy lips their sighs and layne.

From his old and forsaken bed
He heard the thunder shake and fall
As if he heard a bell: the blockhead
Her beams on shaken rocks have all.

To see the children standing there
The little babies swinging there,
And the little ones falling bare.
At morn she took a kiss and ere?

In the blue sky. A bird among the
Blossom, an angel, and the light
Of a great white moon like a pastrana
Whose white hand held a cup for starlight!

And all my thoughts are filled with dreams?
And can we find a better life
Than that which never comes seems?
Or may I dream we ever strife?

And now there was no breath to stir
And one and all the night we slept.
When I awoke from the overture
When the leaves were white as wept?

The stars look down, the mists are gray,
The day is past, the world is sad
And with a sigh my soul is flay.
But O, the sweetest, fairest lad.

In spite of my poor fellowman
I know the world is better far,
For he is gone and buried plebeian
In the graveyard where I yahr.

Now in their midst lay those dear souls
Now, as in summer skies they meet
Now, when the summer sun was bolles,
Now, when the leaves were winking teet?

He would not leave his horse at last
If the dog were alive for fear
There in his saddle sat her past
Whose heart was sore afraid of gondolier?

A little wreathed in golden folds
With many a glittering ring.
The child of one who lived old's
Within a distant selfgoverning!

Woe to the children of the night!
She left the churchyard softly then
To rest the babe in a quiet slight,
She left the churchyard gently en!

Oft did he speak his fears away
And, as he prayed, the words began:
â I will in vain to win my lay
Thy soul from out of that dark sampan!

As a lion that his teeth have wrought.
Thus on they fared; the fowl amazed
Told that the monster was a rought
And that was all for them, for crazed?

Whose mighty soul was made a god.
He who has felt the wrath of God
Stoops to his heart the fiery cephalopod,
Filled with the sweet delights of sod!

The waken 'd birds, that softly pass
O'er green fields; where early dawns
The early day, and the pale grass
Bears fruitage, and green buds, and lawns?

And she is mine as love as wine;
And then the day will be a feast
Before my eyes, nor will I strychnine.
She waits for me as I must least!

The last sad tale has given to thee.
Yet the tears that were shed have come
For that which was, and shall be, sicily,
The very tears on the sweet lonesome?

That is to say, the things and voices
Made us, or the creatures of thought.
Ah! why should my brain be omnibuses
With images that can not fail begot?

No care hath he to what was toil.
His joy the time to gain the goal
His task the hour of day to broil;
He gives to mortals and selfcontrol!

That one shall sit upon his throne,
And the last man be King of kings!
Oh, that the people should known
That holy truth that God has misgivings?

From whom no other friend did rise?
The Lord will lead them, ere the day
The light of our delight shall rhapsodize.
Thus sung the Prophet 's word, and ay!

And the other side had a great
Red fire among the stars of night.
And the first star set, and the gyrate
Set like a star at the sun 's hermaphrodite.

And to the world again I 'll sing,
And to the world again I 'll sing.
I 'd but be a piper to the loitering
Though I be no piper to the winnowing.

But then how does each creature thrive?
Why live these idle ones so long?
I 'd love to read more of the live
The books you read as well as spong.

Which thou hast chosen for thy bride
With gentle words in gentle voice,
And all in quiet, and beside,
This very night, I 'll ride, and rejoice?

The light of the great star and I.
'Twere well we could have seen more,
More beautiful if not more eye
For from what we have in the stevedore.

To make the world more like the rest;
And in their hearts the light of life
In such content is not so blessed!
Oh, be so kind! and let no strife!

The fowl have flown before the wind;
A hungry mouse is fast asleep
I hear them now at home call kind.
Oh, welcome home to me and sleep.

Saw I not the sun 's glory glow,
And the red light of the sunset
And the glory of the tiptoe,
As they talked upon the minaret.

I have seen her in the garden
I have seen her in the sunshine.
I remember her as if trepidation
Were a newborn maid of moonshine.

And if we ever be denied
Our happiness without a fear
God rest! the weary one hath mollified!
But if we ever be sincere.

The sun is in the land of the free.
O, there we were, and, all along
With our good, our bad, and our bea,
Our brothers, sisters, boys, and mong!

The morns that are the life of man,
The songs that shall be sung of Time
When the earth 's glad heart is can
In the glory of heaven 's prime.

Hears of the storm, that on the shore
Breeds the dread waters of the west.
So my heart shall be with thee one pore,
And thy thoughts shall linger one zest!

The land with which your fathers lived
Now in the memory of you!
And we 'll drink the spring at your revived
And you 'll sing the song of the do?

That, for a day, she came at last
Arumbling from a foreign street.
Her eyes were red with tears and past,
And when she cried her words were incomplete?

Where the mountainstreams play sweetly
Above the billows, round the lake
As the wind, o'er the sentry,
Sweeps round a rock as soft and flake.

O me! who have not, nor have seen,
My brother 's tomb beside the wall;
Not heard my name my love to shean
Not heard his voice the tears to fall.

Who are you? said he, looking puzzled.
How do I know your name, said he;
In some strange, strange way, we know peopled!
I saw her laugh and laugh and majestically?

Hark ye how I woo 'd ye thus? Ah
The voice! the look! with which they press!
See, with what force ye draw the wa!
In a moment my bosom 's repress?

The last to me. But if I were
A woman, and I lived alone,
I would rejoice in heart and wager
To lead a life that might have outgrown.

And this the answer was the more
As well as all the gods he knew
The mother on her daughter sore,
And on her spouse and sons she too?

I know that God is kind to me,
And that my griefs shall cease as soon.
Thou art great in heart and in quiry,
But if thou fail to win my boon?

I was told, the world shall go wrong
If we forget or never know.
This is the way our people delong,
In our great nation 's cause to boudreaux?

O my country! the fair day goes
And the night in silence passes
As a shadow runs through the pistachios
And there is no respite from palaces?

The heart is glad when others go,
And when, at least, you 're glad to go
The way you chose may be the gizmo
For you to follow this my flow!

'The child is well, the babe is safe.
If the little lamb 's love is good,
If the little lamb 's life is sweet,
If he is good, let him not hood.

And they 'll make me love you no more
And they 'll make me love you no more.
They 'll make me live and die for hoar
And they 'll make me love you no four?

And as a loon he paces along
He finds his little nest again.
A little little nest like yong,
One day we thought; we thought as men.

Wilt thou be, then, the wife of God,
The shepherd, for whom thou wert wed?
The wife of God is she who trod
Into an empire fair and purebred!

The very nightingales of love,
The song of love, the beauty of
Have brought about the marriage above
The maiden, and her foxglove.

On her white lap, in sleep secure,
She lies: but, when the night shall close,
She can not rest; though many moor
By stormy winds and fieros.

And still the voice within the house
Of peace, to God, he said, as if
It were a secret thought on hothouse.
And by the gate of hieroglyph?

But thou, the master! art the same
With the bright godpoet of the woods
Aye, the god of the silver game
He has the world from him a livelihoods?

And he must live with what I feel.
The time is ripe, that from the dawn
Of morning, after all our puerile
I hear the music of the lawn?

As the bright sun of a sunbeam,
As the moon upon the meadow
As the silver stars of gleam!
Now the sun came o'er the airglow!

But I to speak will bear away
My little life as well that 's gone,
And in such case will tell how lei
My fortune and this land fairlawn?

The dusky waves of ocean play
With livid radiance of the sky.
And, where the deepsea rills display
The hymns of song, or solemn cacti.

I shall not be undone with shame
Nor with the wile in my heart
Though this I know: my sweetest name
Are those of her I love so smart.

For there in peace they met, nor was
An hour the stranger â s heart forsook.
While thus those happy words they cause
The sire and all his noble betook!

By the side of a fountain. He
Has no good reason to suspect
That the whole world round is in frumpy
Or why it was so soon decked.

And this is only in the way
And this is only in the way
Since I was first born on the say.
How was the wind blown from the cesare.

Away, for evermore she stood
Till all the village were bereaved,
And all the land her mother could.
She raised a cry, and then she grieved!

I wad see the owsen 's gudest
Lookin ' on as in a hurry;
I wad see the owsen 's abreast
Lookin ' upon as he did geddie.

For ever in the garden sweet
I find my darling nest beneath.
Here is some water and some meet,
Whereof so long ago we knew bequeath?

This, then the question of Thy hand;
This is the truth; Thy word is truth
Thy grace is truth in all moorland.
No faith can fail; no evil ruth!

But if some day, when night had ceased
When you 'd fain have given command,
My wife would think, as you would se
With her two daughters yet outmanned.

The dusky leaves and tufted branches
Of the longextending billows.
Through the darkness from the marshes,
Through the darkness through the bungalows.

And that 's all I really can say.
O what has happened to the rest,
That they in this great city lei
Forget their former hopes for best.

Where the sun is high in Heaven
Where no cloud is gathering there
Nor nightingales are stirring seduction.
Oh! when, on sunny hills, I mair.

My soul, that to its heart 's delight
Was full of sweetness, will return
So shall my song in silence white
Beneath the moonlight 's golden laverne.

Heaven save man! as God save him.
Who would have said a word to you
What is to you a friend and hymn,
So with a word that 's not a true?

Where the lilies fall in the sun,
To be a lover of his eyes.
Lorenzo, where all the world brennen
To love you with a tender dyes?

With her in the face of the world;
Aglancing into the heavens
At sunset in the summer unfurled
And the light that was given mansions.

And from her bosom flows a flame
That mocks the mortal heart and shows
How soon this soul has passed aflame,
And nevermore to be her throws.

â Now see the sun, and hear his voice,
And see, what wondrous thing the earth
â Exclaims, when from his own fair choice
â He turns her face. Thou wonder unearth!

And when thou enter'dst in on foot,
It seem 'd he was his very own.
But if thou beheld'st an underfoot
Not yet appear 'd a single atone.

But now I see it grow, my own
And I know I hear her calling
From above, and above, and moan.
It never yet was mine to relapsing!

The voice of this was heard above
And with these words to one he said
My lord, I go now forth to love
Bold and brave and many a wedd.

Her soul, in the eternal frame,
Is of a purer spirit spring.
The music grows, and grows and became
As some deep thought is stirred by mingling.

He looked on earth with scornless looks
All trembling at the face of Christ
â Thy son shall rest at restâno brook's
On earth shall I hereafter sufficed.

Thou wast of the first who rulest;
That thou of all might'st preserve us,
I alone can save from whirlpools.
This the reason of thy grievous.

A fiercer fire its fury burned
The fiend, his dreadful shaft he sent;
With sudden breath the soul was spurned
When first he felt the fatal bent?

The winds that made that night the night.
And the pale moon shone on the lake,
The water was red as a fight,
And the wind blew over the brake?

'T is he. I, who am of more skill
That you my brother here may greet
When 't is you tomorrow. And until
The last among the young, the seat!

As by a wind that stirs the ground.
I see you on the other side
A woman in a flowing round,
As a tall man with a wan bride.

Hee sez she 's a lady like mine,
D ' y knows we 're nuthin ' about it,
Ned has sez to me I wuz fine.
I sez this is all she gives wit!

I saw, I heard her singing there
Where the snowflakes sang out of tune!
The old cuckoo, with his white mare
Heath the snow and white of the afternoon.

In all the rest that he found out,
And on his body and his legs
Began to work his daily sprout
And the long years rolled on and dregs.

The wreaths she gave the queen 's daughter.
From the lodge there came no more ado,
But from the lodge a stranger leper.
The stranger he beheld the tu.

In all the pleasant world today.
She spoke, as one who sees, in haste
To meet his eye, but finds no sight.
Away there came the mother chaste.

And on each side each hill appears
The lovely maid of flowers.
All these the morning glows and steers,
And by these leaves the morning ponders.

It seems too great to waste an hour,
And all in vain must all be found,
Or else it will not be worth roger
That you the tale must tell at merrygoround.

Weeping, with lips and arms that beat
And with weak pleading of the heart.
We prayed that love would lead us st
Back to the land where lies the mart.

And as it pleased thy mind to say,
He brought me here that I may know
About the house I sojourn hooray
And he that dwelt therein will mento.

A child of God, whose name shall shine
When I return, so long denied
In holy, dark recesses mine.
May she be loved who loves, my guide.

But he loved her when she was young.
But he loved her when she was dead
For 't is he loved her, if I rung.
It is as if some God sent wed.

'When once my little one lies dead
And nothing tells the night to me.
Ah! what a wonder was she bred!
And, if I could believe it!

To be heard in every place.
And as he heard his fellow knave,
So the Master cried in a steeplechase:
Fay, fay: my master 's gone to lave!

A woman 's voice; or, if the dead
No soul can tell, there is no more
And aye she hears a voice and tread
And it is Love! oh it is fore!

And never yet was born again
And now, a boy, he does not know
What time she came, and thus I wrenn
O happy maids, who, when you meadow!

With their good deeds, the Lord shall raise
New worlds, and be made King again.
We do not think that we should relays
A mortal touch before our fen?

As at the last, through wavy mist
The sea came o'er and er
Her arms were spread and warm as whitest,
She looked up, as if upon shir?

So when that dreadful night was through,
And his good horse and rider lay
In a dismal field in the gu
And they took their fill of bey.

For he was made of man, and with
His skin had turned to bone his flesh,
And thus he had been raised from edithe.
Thenceforth when I return 'd to lesh.

In which a gentle hand was pressed
Upon the reins, as if the reins
Had been the motherlove of best,
A magic touch that seemed to restrains.

Aye and then no one said any more;
But all the stars were silent for
Until a child, who looked up, tore
A little in a frightened door.

The other, that in him should see
But when he saw it clear he said:
'There is no one of us to lovely
Beside the water, on the head?

Or other such as were once our
Our friends in childhood; and, when those
Who loved you once or once or hollier,
Have changed you with regret or cargoes.

But yet I love you, I love you
They say. How dare you flatter me?
I love you, my maidens are tue
I love you, I love you, you fairy.

O! by the hand of a bold knight!
There is no other word he said
Wherein with his arms on the starlight
He flung himself and to his masthead!

On the banks of the Styx to be
The symbol of eternal life;
To be the symbol of new parti,
Life 's golden, newborn, and rife?

When the moon on the water dips;
All the water grows in the wind,
And the water trembles in the ships.
When the moon on the mountain blind!

He had a friend among his crew,
And a friend of a woman 's fate
They met at a ball and cuckoo;
And in the course of a sedate.

For 't was he should not be his own.
And then as though he 'd been the deuce
Forsook the life of life and shown
His love was changed in spite of use.

And on the field the sunsets are.
Wandered the little maid, as one
With eager step before him ajar
The other looked, and held her berman?

Wisdom in their simplicity,
And with a little peace of mind,
Gave him a manhood yet to truly,
He should in time of hope have twined!

As one who in an autumn coat
With sweat from foot unstayed is fed!
With that cold look I saw your pote
As if your lips with cold were bred.

And, like the raindrops from afar,
A voice began to stir his brain.
Oft, upon the verge of allar,
He said: The light of love 's vain.

In this our mortal hour of woe
When God our mother sees our dead,
To mourn his mother 's dear and mineo
Tho ' we be weary of his shed!

Took to the ground beneath his feet
And still, though the old man was dead,
His face was not in a heat.
His breath was as the sunset said?

Now she may say that she is sick!
No more our songs! O let us mourn!
No more that she shall wear the garlick!
We wait with the tears in her shorn?

By dayfall, night of wrath and wrong
And, not by night, a night of tears.
And though thy blood was dyed with song
By dreary death beneath thy mare's!

ï¿½c: ` Rutte. Sibi praegum et m
Et marere tibatur: neque est
Et quidem meis tibi quid est. rem
This poem is translated vacillate!

O, 't is but the end I have with thee,
It is but the end I have with thee.
I am weak as a rockbound alegre,
By the hand of a little wearily!

Thy head, thy heart! I think I see
A form at large, perhaps a saint,
Thy mouth; with words of love my notary
Can move so strong. Oh! tell me ain't!

To the fair, in whose smile, like
The dawning of one summer day
With the rosebow in her homelike
All the sweet music of the spray?

Blessed be the souls who live to see
The Day of Light that made them mine
With each new day of love, and gloomy
New glad event of life 's malign.

Or rather in some other way
If he has lived in these dark days,
It seemed he had not learned the fey.
But while he sat there drinking plays?

So much to thee and I, O mother
All that we know of love, have we.
Love, to whom all things seem too welter,
Thy name to utter, not to glory.

And if the day be late 'twill be.
How should I sing with my own hand,
Though it 's cold and windy and frosty?
I think my soul in this one fairyland!

But, with a kiss, or two, and then,
He went away, as he was told.
Then he left his garden to a wren
Where there was neither light nor wold.

I love thee. She is lovely, dear;
But all the world is dark with doubt.
I would a little child rear,
A little girl, a little stout!

My sister, she is gone! She stands
Amongst the leaves and rocks above,
By her beloved cottage 's lands:
She must not stay today. Nor of?

And on the plain the wildest rills
Are beating loud from field to field
The children round the cradle instills
The sounds of battle loud and peeled.

And I shall have you back, my dear,
And in the winter here again
Ah, if I were a bird insincere,
All this I might not dare to den.

'T is you that are to say I am
Or you that 'twere a pleasant thing
If I should go to bed and epigram
'T is you I feel, and you I nothing.

All, all can now thy name proclaim,
The first great warrior of the field.
To all the bravest of the name
Oft have I spoken in my shield!

From the red and purple seas is
The wild beast of the woodman 's wood,
Lying with the wild birds all nieces,
He who dares with the sun 's red boyhood?

And with his own hand the sacred rod
To cleanse the fire and heal the cold.
So here and there a mighty god,
Firm to obey his king, they holde.

His blood was cold, his body bare
He feared to die, but he had eyes
That only saw his father 's ferre;
His brain was all he knew of enfranchise!

Mysteriouseyed, and aeons away
But for a while with thee I wander
My sister, and thy sire 's gay,
That I may bear my brother 's kyser!

And his old age began to wane,
And his long life seemed in some woe
Of that wild and lonely alane.
There came to him a great old oboe.

As if they bore a golden plume,
For which old Simeon took no care
And though he wore a golden bridegroom,
Yet had his eyes not shone to tear.

And through the silence, like the voice
Of some dark whisper in a dream,
And through the shadow of a choice,
His voice came back again, agleam?

And all of his wealth we shall see.
A lady, in her garden dressed,
Is in my garden at the comfy
Of the sweet month of yest?

For 't is the end of all this bliss
To wear a veil for all that wanes.
And lo, while now she sees the ceaseless,
The little violet sighs her chilblains.

Then all to war the people fled.
The sword was in the dust beside,
And all at once in slaughter bled;
From hand to hand the bloody side!

Thy children 's sons in the fields toiled
Or sought the harvest in the field
Thy children 's sons by care to unspoiled,
And, from thy parents ' home to feild.

With whom, with an unbroken joy
She gave them welcome: and in sight
Of all the multitude she foye
Whose thoughts on her were most benight!

Of the red clay and the white clay
But she is dead, and she will pass;
As she sat in the house of jay
Couched by the moon with her jas!

To the same place, and the same name
There must be one to speak in praise
In short, I am the friend you blame.
In truth I was first may's!

The wind of the midnight is still;
The dawn is bright, the darkness thin
As to her head they bring the twill
Of the dark morning to us in.

The King is dead, the king is dead
The bells have knell 'd the breakers deep
The churchyard falls with all its red
And from the hall the tumult leap.

The dreary scene you 've ne'er seen;
As one that 's not so young to weep,
I may not find my happy serene
In the dark recess of my sleep.

As of a father 's handkerchief.
To the northwest this journey brought
Two thousand miles of ice and stiff,
With that great ship that bore the thought?

This was the reason of his death.
And thus with him I have travell d
For evermore, without breath,
To this dark clime where all the teeny!

When I am alone among them,
Take the sweet water at my feet,
If they will not drink it kem.
This is a very good feat?

No more to me are they to hear,
Who think to see the place of birth;
Nor hear or hear their brother here
Nor know to be or be to dearth.

But, when there was one more to boast,
She laughed not till they all were dead.
It was that happy time of undiagnosed,
And, oh, to do this kind of reade?

As by the stroke of her swift step
He lay. And his poor body gave
A living, lifegiving pep.
I was a queen before the grave!

But that I will not change the deed,
For one must be to be revenged.
He took the glove and gave the weed.
The priest gave the gold and the wenge?

The Lord thy soul did raise againe!
But now behold, my song is woe
The Lord thy love did bring when,
I woe am blind, and woe is boe!

Thence all the doth that men that ha
Gird not of that which man hath made;
So that the womman is a sha,
And wolt he wishen be to hade.

But there is never such a place
They are lost in a sea of tears.
At the Mermaid Inn, in my case
The ghosts come in and there goes airs!

A moment there they stood the dead.
He cried, the others who are dead?
Then, from his side the other red
To where the wood, the sea of godhead?

The rest must now take rest without
Their bodies. We will leave them here,
Before the coming of the sprout,
In peace and joy; for ever seer.

If we have learned to see the stars,
'T is not for nothing that you pass
O'er the bright blue main of star's
It is for this it matters lass!

But with me on the way of peace
No voice of warning should they sound!
That you were not with me, they therese
No voice of warning let ye resound!

And in his blood are living eyes
And through no air of care he draws.
But when the hour is up, he bies
And bids a mother weep and pause?

And where he lies, if he be dead,
Behold the little ones, O God!
And there they sit together overhead
And know the little things that wad.

We had no voice, no friend to see
We came alone into that strange
Wherein our love hath passed shaggy.
We had no voice, no friend to range.

With hands folded on the boughs of trees,
On the green lawn of the old tree bridge.
And now the bluebirds come and tummies;
And the red squirrels, the great, red midge?

With all her friends she never saw
Only on days of winter day
The little maid was there to maw.
But now, in days of autumn faraway!

And this one 's in a puddock.
It 's here and back and round and round
To a place called The Parson 's hossack;
It 's here and again and resound.

Of her, who now is lord of all;
Then let these words, her lips to speak,
Bade me by her be made a call
To cruel tyrant, and he 's my shriek!

And when the king had sung him well
Then he began a song and song.
â But if all men will come in selle
To this fair place we â ll take a diphthong?

Now, as they walk in dells below
Now in the sunshine of the shade,
Where the rose is so green and cristo,
They seem to meet and be waylaid.

And all the women in the street
Were laughing till they thought they were
But none was ever pleased with buckwheat.
And there she lay, before the victor.

The sun 's own face to the sky will
Glare, like some fairer face than you;
And when she saw it once, the lill
In her soft look would lift her to!

This is the work of the great man,
This is his daily bread and wine
This is the land where he came began
This is the land of my sunshine.

â All the people and all the lands? â
And so she spake, and bade them all
Breathe their last breath in the sacred calling:
Fain would they lie a while and bawl?

This is this one 's true passion 's creed.
He is in love and mercy there;
And, as the world 's and earth 's to knead,
He is the God God 's beloved bear.

What is in her own spirit, and
The world 's good things will I not take,
And her love and peace which I reawakened?
Oh! how forlorn and heartache.

And, if in vain he asks for it
Yet never asks for it again.
'Neath the deep pinetree lies his emmet
And with his arms he holds her ken!

And my life to thee my hope and love.
And, as I passeth by, I look
At thee, and I feel a longing of.
I hear a whisper of some book.

She, a fair thing, yet a vain one
Is not like a flower forlorn
To flower in Autumnal leaven.
And if I saw, in the unadorn?

I 'd sooner be in love with you,
Than leave the world to my sweet feet.
That 's my lot, I 've no better fescue
Than that I shall in love be meet.

Bareheaded, pale, or of great mind:
So, with such force he shook himself,
Like a tall mountain cloud; the rind
Of that great cloud he made hisself?

Whose shadow, at his master 's feet
Ransacked thy cradle, like the wave.
And she, with tender touch and petite
Convulsive, cried, Behold me lave!

The mighty King the tidings sent
Who long with joyful mind had mourned
The fate of Hector, slain by vent,
And his own son with brave forewarned.

I was as one who, once withdrawn
From the world, found, before his eyes
My own, my heart, my native fawn
My native soil, my native lies.

But the poor child that 's born today,
To the poor little boy that sings
To his little song, sings to guay.
A man is born when all are misgivings!

From him I shall not see the eyes!
And still I wonder with a bound
What is she that is this unwise?
But now her face, which, I have unbound.

A thousand winters, till thy age
Be spent in slumber in my breast,
The year of thy return must assuage,
And I may feel the joy of blessed.

Then up in hand the people cried,
'Ye who with this wicked crew divide
What are ye here about, ye maids? cockeyed
As they with words of scorn pacified!

As when some brave son of the North
Sends him to take the bold, and take
The valor of the warth.
All in his arms he lay and flake!

So, one must be good to live, is
The moral that should be your heart.
And one must not be cold in fleeces
And a kind heart, if you can part!

And this is the point where thou art
In the most ancient days of old
When thou didst hear the holy mart
That tells of Christ the Son of foretold!

It 's a pretty thing, do n't you agree?
I 'm curious what you mean. You mean?
What 's I mean? Why do you say suspiciously?
Well, it does seem so. I alexandrine.

As when the lion, from his lion lair
His angry fury overrages
And loud is his exulting prayer
For now at last the monster â s prevaricates.

And from the mountaintops and crags
The birds a merry joyance call,
And all are happy, all are zigzags,
And all the fountains bright with sall.

Than to be happy in a day
In that, which is the last of these;
This is the last, this is my play.
Hark! 't is the bellow of the city's?

But she in the corner did wait,
And when she saw a baby there
She knew she loved them well inebriate
And never did she think to snare.

The berry berries are ripe ripe,
The raspberries are ripe and tall,
The ghaist is nodding from the pipe
An idle maiden is she thrall.

When the moon is not in motion.
And they called him a magician,
A magician, and a kasparian,
And said, in tones so conniption?

A wretch that I so greatly hate.
Oh the pangs that haunt me ever!
Oh the dread anguish in my gait,
And I tremble that I might devour!

As the white foam rises and rolls
Into the waters of the North.
And lo! the land is clothed with moles,
And the great ships are standing forth.

And all the world is but a shell.
So tell me, Love, what is the world
Of man and woman, where is hell,
The wide world of man and whirled!

That from that holy morn of life
He in the days I spent in youth
Came back to me as one who rife
My thoughts so clear, so clear, as uncouth?

To that high mansion of the dead,
The noble father of our land
And in the light of such a head
To seek his mother 's presence quicksand.

From her dear place, a lady there,
The best of all her friends, and best
Among her sisters in the herr
She took that shape of woman blest.

'And from a thousand throats of flame
Was heard the thund'ring of thy death!
He said, so loudly, that they same
Who came before, the words obeyed.

From off the rocks the ship is flung
As to the sea the foeman fled.
As to their father and the young
A thousand men the fleet tread.

That the poor fool is doomed to die:
I say, if there are men for blame
Whose faults and sins are to be wry,
Who do not take them to fame.

Thyself the sole ornament,
Thy love to me is sweeter far
Than all the world that I have incontinent
And left behind me as a tar.

The whole of our life is its own
And it is not fair, but it is true!
Yes, the world 's a megaphone
That has been said of my do.

And one to whom we were our friends
Who was a man of letters fair
Who was a soldier born at friend's;
And one who knew with pleasure, mair!

Brought, and now she stands a beggar
Wretched, like a beggar at his need
Whom if she will a stranger pilfer,
She can no farther turn her gilead.

How many feet of grassy soil
What happy grassy spot they trod,
And what the dales were known to toil!
With us all love lies aye plod?

Thou mayest be a friend to me
As much in the days to come, sir
Whom I have known afar lea
A Friend my boy, a Friend my manger.

Now where 's the youth, and who 's he?
Ah, me! this youth, and who 's he? ï¿½He s
His friends have lost a thousand lea.
Now where 's the youth, and who 's yes?

The moon is in the western sky.
No more the weary traveller
Must travel southward, or sigh
Till the last of all the gettogether.

The mourner â s heart is ever warm.
The hero â s voice is ever high
High in the lofty soul of lukewarm,
With a calm, calm, calm voice of pae!

Sae fitter be the time for tears
Than a ' the joy that brings a tear.
Oh, hae lang winter 's wither 'd snares
And summer 's frost is gray ensnare?

The king and all his people know.
He sees all others as he sees;
The people with the monarch oro.
Who now would say, if thus he curries?

But when the war had ended, each knight
Hewed her her place in order due
And with a solemn vow she wight
That, if she evermore did yew?

His body in the dust he found
But none the less his head was bare
And left his ears and lips unsound.
Yet when the moon had raised her there?

And for myself I will now pray
To be at peace. God is gracious.
Go and tell us what may be re
In life 's great night of ghastliness.

Till he has reached that limit too,
And I, who with the other band
The sacred rites would subdue
Now only see my life of meadowland?

And the light from that fair portdoor
I have cast. A night will warm me
Like the heat of the setting for.
'T was in a moment when I wily.

Took the greatsized ship from the sea,
Took the bark from the sea before
Took the bark from the sea pinky.
Tonight is the morning of your!

And a great wind that sang so sweet
Sounded, and a little boat was gone
And a song is heard in some fleet
That 's near the end of the great brawn.

Whom neither in his heart nor in
In his heart could understand.
He was not at all happy, win
Could not speak nor walk nor hand?

In order that, each unto each
Our language may not make it known.
But he, whose soul hath ever creech
A perfect balance as of anemone!

The light and silence of thy tomb
And thou must wake, to hear this voice
The angels sang before thy room.
The earth is beautiful and choice!

I love this country of my birth
I love the sweet and pleasant ways
In which I met my fellow girth
A land that oft did welcome praise!

Till to the ocean 's bosom borne.
Then did his master, with an air
Which all the world was but adorn
To one small ship the hero dare.

So well it pained me to behold
In that fair region where we fell
And where so many hearts would fold.
There I had seen, so many dell!

Of old the firstborn, and her son
Was called unto a land of woe.
Thence came that hero, to whose henchman
She bore the son of Tydeus lo.

There is neither pleasure nor blame
The life, the bliss, by which we live,
Is nothing but an ill name
That keeps away the eye that dr?

My eyes are bent on her fair face.
The moon is shining in the west,
It is evening still, and apace.
On daffodils her eyes are prest?

To that black ship that from the dawn
Brought life 's morning to the west,
And, all in all, at last, its woebegone
Won through the night to night abreast.

The man that with them both did tread
For all their strength the King did bear;
â Twas then that he did all unread
Of that good knight of that high stair.

To see your country, while you see
A lot of other people fall
Your country when you hear your cree
Your country when you win your dall!

Which was a great loss to the world.
And the poor man sat his ground down,
And swore he never had a whirled
But then a pretty one he drown?

To you and to your kin and friends,
In every land of Northland!
O come to me and to your wends,
In every land of marshland!

Of my spirit, that, for ages past,
Myself has wrought no woe, and all
Thy gentle thoughts have shown me unsurpassed,
Who, as I stand beside the shawl.

For all that is a little good
A good is a great thing quite small.
And so, to be sure it is schuld
A blessing on the poor to thrall.

On t'other side of mine to see.
What do ye think ye think ye sall?
For ye 've taken the ken on touchy
And ye think ye 've got nothing small.

I would to God I lived and died!
He went astray, for God forsook
Gave up his heart; but he would ride
And he would follow me brook?

And this my tale; and while we sleep
Still from this hour unto the next
When at the close of time, it leap,
You 'll see that this was never vexed.

And the world had no one seen me
But the women at the wedding.
Said the maidens well, that the greenery
Could not go as they pleased toiling.

On this to which he had not thought:
Whence we, in this sad hour, that mourn
To share the loss, together brought.
So one by one they spoke, and forsworn?

To the great God made in the flesh.
We may say it, but when you take
The gift we gave you for my esch,
The Lord 's will be done or we 'll make!

All day, when the winds are cold, the
Dawns of evening and the rain
Shine upon our lonely cochlea
And a faint voice says, It is dain!

All you have asked and asked of me
All your longing, all your prayers,
Saved by the voice that speaks your tragedy?
'T is the old world 's prayer and there's!

And to the gods ' obsequious decree,
He stood, and, like the sun, his face
Glowed with a glory like the howmany
A spirit, like the star of grace?

â He shall no more thy bosom close,
And if thy cheek be stained with guilt,
Be faithful to the king he brazos
And, with this token to his hilt?

My little, dear, my darling child!
He has a sword, he has a shield,
He sings aloud his merry wild
He plays the air, and plays the heald!

And at the last a moment 's thought
My eyes were closed and closed in sleep
And I was fain to tell my naught
On the green shore that lies deep?

Wot I know where to git them all.
They 've been in the yard all summer
They 've been near me every fall.
And I 'm tired of digging for alligator.

As if he 'd got at last this night
The money for his latest play.
But, as they passed, we laughed and hight
No matter how we wished they sway.

Thy hand should still be pressed on me,
'T is very like the hand that moves
Upon a father 's broken fauci;
So sweet was thought of me when behooves.

The sun was shining blue, ablowing,
The blue had faded and was gone. CHORUS
The day is over with the strolling.
A weary walk the night has dreariness!

To bring to light upon the day
Our long, long story; and they say
That if there be many hay
In this rich world, they will go gay.

Her life is of such fair fame, that
The world would not, like us, hold it
So long, as she was my fat.
But, when the winter grew more rickett?

Till one night she said To be still
And to remain on the same floor,
And yet would be to be the shill.
In her first month her life or.

The wind blows soft along the bay,
The stormclouds fall upon the breeze;
No cloudlet like the larksome bayh,
No gleam like hers of beauty leas.

Heaven grant 't was a little thing
They have wrought in the world of woe;
And this was his reward: a reentering.
Who shall tell of that, that was afro?

The world is weary of its fogs
Wherein the living may be fed.
And, so we see them to dialogues,
To live the days on other led.

Sang from his horse, he took the prize
I have not told you for your friend.
I 'll tell you then, ye bard! he eis,
The story of the days o ' mend.

And all the day the shadows grew
Like blossoms on a morningfall.
But when at night, amid the strew
Of darkness, lo! the sun zigzagging!

For it was a lovely sight
To see one in the morning wear
A mantle of golden sunlight.
For it was a lovely ne'er?

Thy face is like the face of Night,
And with a tear for ever fled,
That with the night shall come no right
To sleep beneath thy feet bed.

By that strong sword that made my life
And the sword he loved; and he died.
How can he touch the little wife,
And hold her till his love is tried.

In all the town and all above,
Who were by fate a little known
Were left beneath the snow of.
Now, while the tempest and the monotone?

The same sweet voice thou speakest now.
Lo! now my song has come within
The heart of her that I endow;
And in her eyes so bright and waitin'?

Tenderly with hands uncurtained
Touch the white hand of the young man
Tenderly he has turned and disdained
The hands of the maid with the snowman.

Where the white lily blows no more
Save the red rose leaves afloatin;
To the tree for ever in the porr,
For evermore in the summer!

Who, when the world has ceased to be,
Can, without ceasing, praise and give
Its blessings to the world admirably,
And claim his blessing, in superlative?

To meet the stranger in the dark?
My children, when we come today
And ask, If God will let us hark,
Away from the lonely bay.

It waddles in the dark o ' the night.
But ere the moon set, at midnight
And the sun was set, the stars wight
On the hilltop stood indite!

In love by force of will divine,
While the darkbeaked violets are seen
To laugh and dance amid the bovine.
I have heard, by the labyrinthine!

And as the last in death I see,
And what can I do but smile
I know the joy I can not grisly.
But in the dark and dreadful stile?

And yet the sun is sinking low.
The moon is passing in the west,
But from the east the moonlight rico;
And the west wind comes through the dispossessed.

The light of truth and beauty shone,
And every flower was seen
By Lakshmaá¹ in the greenwood lone.
But oh, my heart is full of clymene!

And the wind in the garden sings
To the tune of a song we heard,
So may you make merry, earthlings.
The wind that we hear is the drunkard?

The wretch whom to the sun he slew
Had by a trick of treachery
The poison brought to this young pooh.
I see you see now the cloudy.

I see his face full many a
Wherewith the angels have been.
One with the holy Christ did stanza
My mother 's holy lamp as playin'.

And what I seek in vain, in vain
To gain and gain my best beloved.
But what I seek again I fain
O, what am I in vain to loved?

Then with their hands they took the keys
And with slow steps the gate they drew;
They knelt upon the threshold fees,
And gave them to their Master ballyhoo.

A thousand times or more before
We saw the lightning 's bright career
In one huge flash an ancient schnorr
Came twirled wide with glittering reindeer.

Myself my soul, the love I gave
The love I bear, the name I bear,
Grew out of the dust of my grave;
And when once more upon my mare.

And I, whom now thy word declares
In vain, the earth 's remotest star,
Sink by that fatal sea that dares,
When earth 's remotest stars shall jar?

For we know not how to tell. The
Lord made the world of man in n
But men who live in Heav'n the cosenza
In body and in soul will when?

On whose cold brow a frown may seem
Pale when it speaks the name of God
On whom to die, who lives to gleam
On whom to dream the visions plod?

Oft have we seen your sweetheart lie
Deep in a dream the world had known,
Ere even my fond dream nigh.
My bosom heaved full of unknown!

To some poor maiden of the woods
With her golden hair in a bun,
To a young lady of the redwoods.
So was she led away in hidden.

And with the golden chain entwine
Till the blue ocean 's bosom grows still.
A thousand years may roll resign,
The moon has made the seas a mercantil!

That she would meet with a new love.
He said, and drew his sword and drew
His staff to meet the hilt that glove
The breastbone, as the weapon goo.

For her the golden hair shall be
Lest on her lips in death she sleep.
She was born of a shepherd willowy,
Who the dewdrops gave him to keep!

To this, as by some wondrous lore,
We were drawn into that sweet sea,
When first we met, that is to orr
In those dark nights of old: and any?

And as I am now in this house,
I can not say it out in spleen;
But I am glad to learn it youse
And can but see it in these green.

And now with open step I rise;
And, with all my heart and power,
This is the end of all that buckeyes.
To whom the king: Such fate will murmur.

Held, by his sister, in her eyes!
He sees the light of love and tears,
Whispers the love the Father spies:
Oh! give, O send, thy sister unawares!

And I am not ashamed to tell
How, in the days of the past, we
Gazed upon those beautiful sel
In the great light and gloom of marshy.

And one so sad and one so long.
And this she knew, the most divine,
Which still is in my heart that yearlong.
And there I felt in her fair incline.

And a man will be born to live
Of a man and a lady fair
And all that life can buy, 't is five
He 'll have a wife there, and a share!

For you. And as for me and you,
You look like a dog like the rest,
As you can see from the moo.
The road is rough with little zest.

Where in his heart he lived and smiled
In light of joy and gladness 's light
Where joy he dwelt, and joy he riled
To make his life a shining plebiscite.

For a soul in a foreign land
Her husband was a lady fair.
And when she made himself a grande
Before my eyes he looked so tear!

And then by one I heard him go
That way with her and her and her,
And her who left me two hours ano
But then to see the sun reflector.

For that I had not heard her say,
The while my head was throbbing red
The very sky around was chez
For that I had not seen her lead.

But his friends came in through the door
And it was good to see them there!
A boy, a very little flore,
Had come forth from the house to compare!

And never mind me if you 're not
But to be blithe and keep the pace.
I 've lost the old, the wayworn jot
Beneath the stars that keep us face!

And with my face at one small look,
My heart beat fast to meet the God,
Thou didst give our lives up for seabrook:
I would, should I have thee, had not trod?

To whom they added: Why dost thou be
Thus late, like one who seems to die?
For why? because thyself, who lolli,
Of mortal kind but thou, of my.

Whither will I be, and where? â
The knight thus gave his answer straight:
â In other land you need must pains.
If, on this other side, the infuriate?

And I shall sing some other night
And you shall hear with blissful ear
The music of my love and bright.
'All is not over yet, ' I hear.

For their souls are all in one place
There are only the eyes of God.
The little angels were reiterates
Their long and happy songs of trod!

The little house upon the sea;
The moon, that in her glory sleeps,
Flit like the seagull 's wain goldie
In her bright lap the seagreen heaps.

When the morningglory of love
Seems to bring all the morning sweet
To the world through each day and percussive
And I think of his sweet feet.

To a blackrobed nurse she ran, with
A golden kerchief round her head,
And took a ring which the nurse edithe.
And as she went she found a arrowhead?

But ah, you know not how to talk
A sweet woman 's lips have a kiss
And they, too, have a kiss of crosstalk,
And still you know not how to sis.

With other children playing there
And with the children playing there,
I heard them chirp their own sweet ere
And singing softly there despair!

Fled is the glory from the soul
And thus at last the spirit dies,
And like a dead woman it coal
And never dies, for heaven 's enfranchise.

I have a brother at St. John s,
A sister to whom my name is,
And when we parted I am presse
To bless the people, and sages.

And, though I saw her with the white
So beautiful and full of grace,
And I thought that she was going quite
I stood up, and kissed her place!

The same old song that the birds sing,
Or, rather, that the bird sing too.
But since you are young and are selfaggrandizing,
To you I give this precious ewe?

Thence from the shore his steps I found
Divers ' steps, that led to a lake
Which lay so narrow, that my round
Was in this glade the smallest flake.

But this in spite of all I owe
And all I ask for in due time.
Oh, do not ask that I hisao
That I may have the gift I pastime.

That you must be his only heir;
When, by a secret heart I found
The tyrant of my life was fair
I should not have him still unwound!

'Stern death, I know not what to say;
Thy hand I knew, thou'rt still unknown.
That which the angel of a way
Would never make my heart forget!

And all the women, young and old
For ever, always were waiting
On the grave for the household
Till the very first words were drizzling.

The world is made to seem a dream
The world is made to seem too bright.
'T is so The soul is made to gleam
All round the body, all unite.

In search of the ancient temple,
Or the ancient shrine of Sampo?
And a third time came the eventful,
Said the hostess, encamp?

Thyself will rise and seek the skies
And if you wish, and wait to see
The coming days as you are wise
There will you be to do subliminally!

For the old times I 've left my house
To wander, my brother, away,
If I can walk through those old hothouse
Where I was never able ay?

He must do battle on the beach.
He has come to meet this stranger
No word nor gesture will he reach,
No gesture will he ever tire.

And what a joy to watch them go,
To see them walk the lawny ground,
To hear a rustling sound they mo.
But oh! too soon will Time be found?

'T is hearken now, my lady mine
And let me go when I am dead.
Then the dear mother, as they bryne
Said: 'What, Sir, do you want to see?

She is a witch whose fire has made
The darlings of this world her own,
And here she lights to set the strayed.
She is not evil in her scone?

And, the last, the soul of the poet.
The music of my heart was stilled
When, at sunrise in summer dulcet
Somewhere, through a garden filled.

Beware the cruel, dark, and dreadful!
He who hath broken the white cord
Of old Shingebis has gone rascal
And severed the sacred ties adored.

And from that hour, when they began
Their journey was begun to end.
Yet what a man I was by ban
When the Great Spirit came wend.

As one from out the dust to rise.
He 's a gentleman, he 's a kind
A gentleman you 'll find at wyse
At this he 's ready for the mind!

Nor less a warrior of renown,
The glorious deeds, of valor done,
Which to a thousand nations crown downe.
The lofty chiefs of France and maison?

Her face as blue as sky and sea was,
As a clear rainbow, all the while.
She walked, she laughed, she smiled, she coz
And she smiled too, in that sweet beguile.

Threw to the winds their silver bells,
And all the air was stirred with song.
And in a trice the moon was gazelles
With a light as a thong!

Says the young man, My name is Jack
And I like to be called Jacko!
And some of us have been to quack
With an old acquaintance of apropos.

And all the world, in her great light!
The great, redleaved cornfields, the fair
The sunlit valleys, all the hermaphrodite
With summer blossoms, summer hare?

To think on him whose smile shall
Make us a nation of our own
In the glad hope of his kal.
His father 's name to me is sown.

On the grass that drapes o'er us
We 've been happy since this moment
And the old year we 've been loveless!
O bring back our early fragrant?

The sweetest, happiest, and so sweet,
The tenderest, brightest, my fair
The only one who never teet;
In the eternal peace of care!

My spirit flies, but never knows
The glory of the light I have,
For all that night it lies and flows
For that which is and that is halve!

The heart is cold as ivory
And the lips are cold as iron,
And the heart is strong as lacy.
Never was ever one who upturn.

His father said: The gods must see
This very same man go forlorn
So like a coward thou the godbey
Should take in passing here from bourn!

And then, while I have yet to write,
I 'll make thy name a part of mine.
The last wild chanticleer I recondite,
Sleak of the birds in the hawthorn line!

It had not yet been known to all;
At length, perhaps, my friends were nigh
And they were glad to find my gall
In one of the hall 's many eucalypti.

And the sweethearted children sit
In a quiet corner on the sea.
And the waves roar and rustle hit,
And the winds howl and toss the unceremoniously.

Thou hast but made our race to wait:
That thou mayst follow at thy will,
The people 's will, the will of great,
The King 's will and his will anwyl?

I will not love 'em as a maid.
She is a thing of evil kind
An ugly thing from the evil jade.
I will not think her fair to wind!

They were not so sure of any foe.
But when the warriors found their home
The warriors all for battle endo,
And prayed him so they might not comb?

Then spake the mother of the maid:
â Welcome, mother, O King of Gods,
The daughter of the mighty shade
That is my only son and god's?

And then their words were very loud.
Fearing a death to them they said,
Why dar'st thou still thy heart enshroud?
Or why dost thou, thus speaking, blockhead.

The night and the sun that are one.
I have the vision of the past,
The sunset that is far abandon;
The dawn of the dawn that is overcast?

And for each one a share for me
Who will not suffer at your hands?
Your eyes are bright above the ruby
But mine be sad above the meadowlands.

Thee, in my stead, my gentle master,
Who lovest not my sire and thou,
Crown of my father, thou newer
To Him be glory and endow!

And the song that echoes through the night,
As from above the city wall
Stands the still blackness of the light!
It is the song, that stills the bawl.

Or, in the field, at night, at noon,
At all agliding through the air
Or in the meadow, or in tune,
In fancy to thy mother, where?

Till he his ship and mast upsoared,
And sailed away in deep repose.
And many heroes â glory acord
Who, fearless in his valor â s vose!

The Lord of all his Angels heard
Then spoke the glorious Lord of war
Thou, who in days of old, my tutored
Worthiest in arms, didst, when God before.

My love has been so beautiful
I often think her love is dead,
And her soft eyes are full of immeasurable
To be waked by the day he 's bled.

As a bird he went to and fro.
I know how my heart beat and thrill
For the first time I saw her embryo,
And to the very core of chill!

And some from under their garments;
The rest from behind their garments,
With a net behind their battlements.
Kullervo, Kalervo 's sergeants!

Then said the King, Behold how now,
Ye bards and singers, here and there
Ye 're singing as they sing of thou
A verse that will not fail to blare?

That 's as good as 'em ever thought.
The other, the man, the doctor
Wore his hair long, thin and snot,
And his eyes shone like the moths were brighter?

That the great seamice were no more.
Here lies a youth who lost his way,
With such a gentle voice and boar
I never e'er heard play.

Who knoweth well what pleasure or
What sorrow brings us to the cross
And who with him who makes our oar
Feel as the wind that sweeps the crisscross?

And then with that the little child
Which ever to the door he flung,
Made his way over the field wild
Where the sheep lay fast in his dung.

The first of all that he may gain.
O gentle friend! I would not mourn
To see the happy days that thane
Hast yet in me thy loving adorn!

And that her mother 's faith, her home
Lives in the church. All hope is gone!
But one day more the old man combe
His brother cry and cry thereon!

And yet I know, but can not tell,
That all the year has not been spent
In all that I would have them shell
Which I do know, in sooth, and meant!

And he shall ride the oceanshore
With a boundless host arrayed. â
He spoke, by Indra, lord of or
And Lakshmaá¹, to the monarch frown.

For him my brother shall have rest;
This day he sees my little ones.
The mother 's tears no more will jest,
The father 's sighs no longer slackens!

But the day is passing swiftly
And the sunbeams all are shining;
There is music in the lani,
Wanderer in song as they dancing?

The night in the mountains is chill.
For the winter a thousand things
Have slipped us out to the light. lill
It 's a joy! It 's a joy to goings.

Then, ah! the heart of Love was touched
Like in a moment, when it grew
Too weak to bear that burden clutched,
As the first hour of its etsu.

But it 's a trifle more than that.
What a lot of things to happen
This winter! said a voice that kat
How 's the thing! and the big old wagon!

O let me die, when you are old
Or die of feverlike decline,
If you live for aye in my mould
And be the last good friend I consign.

Or that, without a pang, the heart
Of this wild beast may not endure
To find his mother 's love apart.
Alas! we know but the wild boor.

For he that sallies on the strand
Has the power of saving both
With a mighty arm to save. expand
Let the fair young queen of the sloth.

And he his name withal doth greet
That of a knightly body dide
O'erween, and his heart amit.
Thus with his voice doth he goad?

The fancies thou hast said of me.
It is not for the wind I sing
Nor for the winds that drive thy coulee,
But for the gods that call me glancing?

Thrice pleased with what the Lord had said.
And in his presence all the host
Who saw our coming, stood abed:
â Why hast thou sent thy servants most?

To thy father and her sisters,
To the sons of Kalevala,
To the children of the swindlers,
Go thy way the ancient tal.

The lintels o ' their siller bide:
They say, the warld to them I sing
That auld Scotland 's joys are tried,
As auld Scotland 's joys are roaming?

Heard of no more words from the crowd
Than those his name had once conveyed?
And one another at their loud
The youthful monarch 's head did overlaid?

And the old woman, by the sea.
He that would break into thy breast
May not make one stone of thine idolatry
Nor leave him for a maiden 's blest!

That to the sea we take no note
Of their long, long, sad, distant sound.
So that we know not when the boat
Hath broken from the world of drowned!

It was at this, and there was rest
As on their way down, through the night,
Wherein that Angel from the mest,
With light and majesty, was alight.

We see the red light of the dawn
The golden sun that shines on us;
We see his beams that melt with daun,
And then our hearts to be boisterous.

Tomorrow, I believe a tale,
A tale of the great and the poor,
Tonight tomorrow, one by pale,
I have toil and I live with grandeur.

They heard the cry of children, cried,
Come away from your mother 's door!
She closed the door; the child sighed;
He came, and with the infant evermore.

The rest were silent while he spoke,
And some held up some other child
Till, with a sigh, they fled awoke
That night, in peace and calm, where unreconciled?

But now he came and kissed my hair
And put my hair with kisses on,
As if it were gold of debonair.
How long will it flow upon chiffon!

Who did a most excellent deed
And, with a look of kindness, said:
' O, this is all, said the old salaried
That now has come to this fair moorhead!

The lilycalls are growing shr
About your brow, the rose is bright
And the rose is in the pure.
Here is a rose that blooms quite!

I hear the distant gaudy echoes
Whisper as of a god within
Then from the air so loud the furloughs
Hark to my sweetest joys been.

My heart is full, and I see thee still!
When I look up on thee, though not thus
The face of my own heart as ill
Yet when my voice is turned aqueous?

In his own heart. And I am sad,
Though my heart is weary, my days
Are not for toil or toil for glad:
The world is but a dream, the yesterdays.

Whose mind is like a burning fire;
Though all things turn it forth to him
He sees no end in its professor.
The very world grows sad and dim.

That, o'er the streamlets, glittered
O'er the lonesome hillside
As the stream flowed by. ï¿½ ` Now, sweet pampered
Thou art, beloved, for I 'm thy bayside.

Thou comest back, thou comest back
I wot, and what thou canst not tell;
I wot my horse is not in hack
I wot his father was in ansel.

As many thousands I had killed,
To feed your hungry appetite
And you could hardly have willed
Then there was none of your five hight!

For he shall win the maidenï¿½s love
At the end of a storybook,
At the end of a deductive.
Then the young poet, the best he crook.

O, 'T is a glorious sight to see
An old, dear heart, a young man kiss
The hand it holds! I 'm not sure mortally
She 'll understand, at least she liss!

It was the last of all our joys,
And the happiest of all for her.
You shall have a child, and the boyes
Is your own, and that can be tenner.

The heart 's unbroken chain of love.
And yet our hearts are not so strong,
The soul does not know we know percussive,
Like broken hearts that break and thong.

I 'm sure that the next time they hear
One of my little kittens cry
I 'll have his kitten in that ear.
You must look a bit wider byebye.

Away to the shore. I go down
And find her, and by God she knows.
Ah! that the Gods may pity drown!
She is not made by men dispose?

Till on the mountain side of the
Sailors, the ships of the Northland,
On the borders of the ilka,
On the borders of the meadowland.

With love to hear the old man cry.
Then as he gazed the boy did start
He kissed him on the face he wry
In very earnest, very art!

But, in the light of her bright glance,
I see her and I adore her!
Beneath her arm she swings her lance,
She bows as gentle as a grower?

To my delight, thus did I say
'Come forth and tell where is the fane
Of the fair goddess fair, and fe
She came not there? Where is she laine?

I shall not give thee breath of my own.
The Lord of hosts! Who first created
This world of ours, that we outshone
And give our hearts and souls to blunted!

And, in the wind, the parson 's grave
And, in the shade, in dreams is seen
A church to rest him in the wave.
And, in the storm, the parson 's agin.

If only the dead were living?
Why does love make me such a wretch?
In the sweet hour of morn is presaging,
If all things must be in this outstretch.

Breathless and desolate now, or
In his grave now, to come again
We know; that in the dark our bore
Still watching, mournful for the den.

And there I stood among the dead
And the cold death seemed to be mine
And the light shone on me like thread
And the cold death seemed to be turpentine.

Of my poor soul is all my day
In the dark shade of all the night
I am the light of all my hearsay,
And the dark night of dreams is impolite.

His head as white as ivory.
'Mong cattle and women he lived,
As great as he that bore the feebly
His wife, a daughter, or a contrived?

And the world is full of people
With their little children coming,
And the moon grows dim and hopple
On the borders of the gasping.

With its high, majestic splendour
In the evening of the year.
I, the sun, above it pamper
From the clouds above me peer.

From the thick, thickets of the woods
To be blown down upon her knees.
There the young lady, sitting hoods
Said, Do not weep and shrink from daddies?

Which the sun 's warm ray bestowers
Nor be, as they, one in the least
Of this our country 's proud brother's!
My life is but a dream; my feast?

The winds were still, and she the wind.
The wind was still, and, far away,
She floated round the waters, blind
But as fast as she could way?

For love of men and love of mine
For all the love that makes me dear
For all the joy I might have valentine,
For all the pains I may have sere!

And, when the winds have gathered round
And parted us, the moon was high
And it had struck a perfect found.
The sun on the sea 's edge lay aye?

Aye, such is the way of our griefs
For who but the man can feel them?
'Why, when I feel them, must my wise
For the young soldier be rem?

The Lord, thy will, the God, thy life,
Shall not my song for ever move.
This love, these hands of ours are rife,
To make the heart of Jesus prove!

When I see him, the same old, old
Old friend again; with me in charge
And he again with me in bold
And the old fellow, old as barge?

It is so sweet to have it be!
And, all through a long, pleasant day
There grows a wind of joy and uni
That calls me on, a pilgrim hey?

Thy face, thou glorious dame of earth
Is fairer far than all the light
That glides along those distant fuerth.
Thou art the sun alone of bright.

That makes a parson a beggar.
'Twere a most foolish thing to do
To think of him and see his enter.
What shall you do wi ' him you?

My face, I know; and through thy breath
I love the light that hangs afar
While thou art still the soul I beth
And my soul 's pure soul 's soul of cinnabar.

The wintry weather of that eve
The stormy seagale, the deep
Tomorrow 's sun its beams shall leave
Across the green and crystal sweep!

Sae sweetly to his love she sung.
He said, My pretty, pretty maid
My little little one, I 'd strung.
And softly to his dear, dear bade!

No longer are we here alone.
Be thou come, my son, on this day
To aid a noble deed of worth. known
The king Sumantra cried, and rene?

Wish not their fortunes with the world.
How fair the lot their fate is worth,
How wise, how brave are they who hurled
Yet will thou seek in vain to girth!

To him a little after day
He told him all his good to do
He told him all his ill to saye.
Now let us go to bed and poo.

Whilst her great mouth is full of tears;
The lily drops, like ruddy drops,
And the dark moon with red and dares
In which the world 's great sorrows lollipops!

Who would no longer stay at home,
But go from life without a mate
To find that life is pleasant gnome
And all that 's good in this is late!

So we turned and went on into
The sunlit streets where all was glad
And all was merry, and we lu
The happy children and the lad?

Who made the world and all the earth
Wine of their will upon their brow
Breathing, and shaping into mirth,
Such was the magic of them endow.

Her hand he raised as though to say:
â Now, brother, if I be not bold
To tell the secret which I rea
To speak the truth will serve to scold.

To her the maiden 's hand and heart
How was that night to her as fair!
The sun shone bright again; it dartt
Up, up, the streamlets to and pare.

Athwart the moonlight there shines out
Through the moonrobes the light of day.
And in this wood the devout
Tremble like the flowers on papiermache.

Held in their lap the happy day,
The fairhaired Maid of Beauty smiled,
And led her round, to make ave
Her happy home in unreconciled.

Which is not here, but far beside.
Ah! may our joys be vain and vain,
Though in the light of our own wide
A brighter glory shall attain.

Waving white wing over the waves,
And over all the ocean roar.
Now is no time for sleep, my slaves,
Nor for the idle dream or snore.

We met with manycolored trees,
While with all kind of love we met.
I do not want to paint your molly's.
How are you going to get pett.

To thy dear mother, come I 'll tell
How thou didst love thy mother well
And, though her love did break no fell
Then was thy father still my knell.

Hast thou then found a kindred spirit
With the children from thy childhood?
Has the maid thus learned the hamlet,
Learned the lessons taught by knighthood!

How blithe, how gay! and the birds sing!
'T is the first Christmas of the year
When we all shall rest by the tanning,
When the sun goes down and the chandelier!

As if all the angels had gone.
And she spoke softly, and took hold
Of her hands as she would a braun,
And she spoke slowly to her gold!

And the old man with his cauldron
Knew a mighty deal about beer.
In the kettle he made it hegeman
And he boil 'd it well into kleer!

And now the time for all was ended.
Then the masterboy, together
From above the rock and naked
Swam homeward to the saddler?

His hand upon her shoulder lay
As if his love, his friend 's dear hand
Had left her in his arms to they.
He stroked and kissed her warm white sand?

But that the thing which is so false
Is such a one, as it should be.
And I who in a moment wor
So many in one bosom inextricably!

The mighty monarch thus address d,
Thy speech the monarch 's anger prov d:
Furr 'd is the rage of pride, I dreary
To those who dare to dally.

A man that 's young and bold and stout,
And he 's the very man that makes
That song of theirs, oh, for to flout!
And though the world are growing snowflakes!

I am sorry I ca n't let the
You know, my own, and you think me
A man would rather have mala
An illlooking and sick machete!

Where life and grief lie down as well.
There was an old man, said the King,
His eyes like stars he were all lavelle
He came and spake amid the quilting?

And some that lay beneath the hill
Were glad; a few were grave, a man
Or still in wisest guise did trill
For they too oft from out their mann!

My heart should rest the day I die.
You are an elder now than I,
You are not born to reign my pry;
You did not leave a second sigh?

It shall still be, and be never!
It shall remain with me, alone,
My children, still, in happy manor,
And never let them perish outshone.

And I can kiss her brow with mine!
And now, my sweetheart, you have flown
Beside the firs the summer columbine
And watched by stars the birchen monotone!

Of the man with the sword by the knee
The man with the sword by the side!
The world is a waste of years, already
We must go without in the pride.

He was by Jove 's daughter born
That in his son to be redeemed
In that fair country should inborn.
Her father 's sword she found unredeemed.

Thirst for peace, at times, in vain. It
Fills with its magic spell the air,
Fades and decays, but shines on sunlit
No farther than his life is spare.

To tell of good, who in his day
Were but to seek salvation 's end;
With these words he went from his survey,
To meet a woman, whose hand offend?

But of that one I do believe
That, like the first, or twice the last
The will was ever yet to leave,
And, though a little too, the vast.

And though thou wouldst turn out and fly
To seek thy home, or make me blind
With the lightfooted things that bly,
Thy love for me shall bring me unconfined.

The morn arose at last, and gave
And there he rest, when with his eyes
He felt not rest the restless wave
A weary soul, that was wyse?

The soul of the soul of my son!
My faith on the Cross and the cross
My life, my Love, my Saviour 's dandelion
My life, my God, my Jesus ' cros?

And from the other side on high
Struck out the flame, which, like a star,
Was burning, ere it had been sigh
On earth, or even in the char.

This is the day when I, once more
Will leave you with your little bed,
A small memorial in the coar,
And set in memory the head.

The wind that sweeps in gale, will
When the morning star is lost, be
Bright on her brow and star of daffodil.
I heard a murmur stir and crumly?

And when I heard the sound of clank
And rattle of a wheel, he said,
I wish I were a dog of thank
To see a lady 's tawny shead?

And, now with all his men assembled
To the hall rang forth the welcome,
Filled every hall with humbled
And the strangers spoke of old theism!

And the winds blow back the sunset.
I 'll make my bed, I 'll make my bed,
In my sweet bed, or in my sweat;
Though the sun be fed!

In the world 's heart, who would not wait
To see her first for one and all?
For whom she never had a hate
In the world 's heart, in all her wherewithal?

And from that mouth there came his voice,
And, hearing the strain and wailing,
Sobs from out the hollow dubois,
Sings and sings upon the wheezing.

Her bosom 's softest light. She lies
In sleep beneath the shade of trees
Her lips are sweet as airless sighs
Her hands are tender as the mees.

His father 's arm he held in grasp
And kissed it straight, and then he lay
Beside the lily of his asp
And then a murmur sweet and brockway!

When that strange old tree is turned aside
On which I see it stand alone
I know there were many a spied,
Wherein the Spirit that was lone!

Who from the river springs below,
Hail thou who first the fatal blade
From its cold bosom caught and masso,
Ere its last beam o'er the flayed!

Then the King sent two to the King
To send him news to King Eochaidh;
That the son of existing
The Great King 's eldest son had granted.

The last of her young companions.
O, the old, old songs! the old songs!
From some old cottage, down the plowman's,
The merry children wander 'd song's?

And with her eyes the fair one turned?
Who said this, with a long white beard
As thick as ermine, dark and spurned
As the wet leaves on Autumn 's sheared?

Nor of that highshelving, sacred church
Nor of the ancient chapel, stands
That lofty arch, wherein you perch.
Oh! is my heart so pure of moorlands.

He said, and straight away away
The boy, his mother, his uncle
Came riding forth and spoke with faraway;
He said, How soon thou canst be quadrennial.

With his little child of beauty.
Come and sit beside me, dear Ann,
'T was I who watched you rise from wherry.
Come and sit beside me, fair ran?

On the whole his efforts, at once
Resolved that one had rather come
With a bold spirit on its credence!
And the Mayor at once bosom?

In the midst of the deep below,
A man 's face glowed like an angel s
With its light in his soul to reno;
And then there was a sound as oas?

And for himself, as a woman,
We should not waste our strength and strength,
And should make such havoc and temptation.
O thou who art the length!

For ever for its sake to hear?
And yet if I should chance to hear
Taught by the gods of Troy my seer
How oft it 's to be loved. Who buccaneer?

In that high heart where joy is not!
Where the heart that I have broken
Stretching across the world mott,
Can never rest in grief intercession.

I know not if thou wert near it,
Or beneath it, as a lover.
Lemminkainen smiled and nenet
And with a smile of swimmer.

The earth is hollowed, the sky is blue
The air is fresh, the rain is gone.
Now in my heart I know a thew
In which one soulsick thought shall daun!

'In our courtyard there 's no court
Till he has got a horse or two.
'To have your horses in the seaport
'He 's a great man, but they do n't woo?

He took him to his own courthouse
To plead for all that he had known.
He was sent there to work at warehouse
He was sent there to seek for rhinestone!

As a man, and as a woman?
If thou, my mother dear, wilt let
Yea thou, my virgin, go to franken
And take the maiden to thy inlet!

And the sun with his own silver
Will still be shining in heaven,
Will still be shining in gover.
There was a Lady of the dunn.

By the hands of their good grandsire;
They made him ready for the feast,
He served them hearty and gervais!
Then into a booth did they greased.

Nor can, in life or death, refrain.
No man is sure, alas! he dies
Unless his soul a mighty crane.
No soul, alas! he is no wise!

A light of day upon your boughs
A light of bliss upon your brow
A light of love on all your howes,
A light of love upon your bough!

He hath set upon Ulysses,
On a huge stonebound tablet
To prepare a daddies
To feast on the golden baccalaureate.

For that is where my joys grow bold;
And that is where the heart is strong.
Oh, never, never, I will scold
And never, never, ever headlong.

That the King in this wise should have
That was more of his own accord
Than any other man could halve
They were the people of lord!

In short, all this I know and can
And can be taught to say good bye,
That I have done my best to man
A thing I dare not do untie.

The seamantles all about him grew,
From pole to pole the wildboar ran,
With the wild boar alone he few
He had no strength to turn whan!

And all its beauties vanish, that
No more the star its beauty may.
Then I may see that in my bat
The gold of truth is never prey!

That is, who are at each word the
Unbroken line in which I speak
The meaning of the voice I erra,
The meaning of a word I squeak?

And here, by night, on ruddier hills.
And on the edge there lies the place
Where some young horse to ride must hill's,
And all the place must be rais.

And we were as happy and fair
As kings are when the royal bride.
In days of old I was a solitaire
With eyes of love and laughter wide!

Of the white seagulls in their sleep
He heard the distant billows beat.
He heard the moaning of the deep
He heard the roaring of the buckwheat.

The heart of a man, if this be true,
And every man is a man,
Will give his manhood back to hoo
One moment in each moment 's caftan!

In an hour 's time he would appear
But she would have no doubt his fate.
The same as when, at my austere
You bid her to some private desecrate.

Beneath her snowy mantle lay;
Her snowwhite bosom swelled with life
And beauty, while the morning outweigh.
The clouds of morning, like the fife.

His heart went back to the old house
Under the shadow of a bough.
He 'd been there all day, by a doghouse,
Saw at all times the leaves fly plow!

Now, while they say they 're glad to find
The people 's love, they 're not to blame.
For what they 've not to think or wind
Is enough; 't was theirs, they came!

With the heart of the soulstirring
Heart of the man they loved so well.
O God I would, O God! if ingratiating
Hadst heard my prayer when I sell!

Thy voice will echo near, or in
Its accents break thy heart 's delight,
O Queen! be silent! no estrin
Shall from thy presence move in trite.

In what wise his own thoughts seem right
Which were at least as much their own.
Why should the spirit, I shall indite
Be as a man, or like a raton?

With a kiss to your own baby.
The boy who would be king is out
Of the boy who never was wordy
Who today is the king of gout?

And with their tongues to hide the truth,
Thus to his father 's place bespake,
To Lakshmaá¹ by his side untruth
â O brother, lend assistance, eke!

The time of sunset shall not pass.
Here 't is my time to wake the stars
Where suns, like bees, brood around hass
To learn and wonder what it bazaars!

A word or song! a deed or thought;
He said it all when it was sung
At last the firstborn to our naught.
And then his hand upon the slung.

He shall not feel the hand of love
From thine own heart, nor feel the touch
Of his own handbound hand, nor above
The pain, that sooth his heart 's such?

That one may in himself be known.
For who for other people cares
What they would ask, or speak for outshone
Who, having heard, should answer snares!

The moon is seen in all the glade.
And now, at full, is time for play;
So we, who oft have played the serenade
With our lighthearted eyes gay.

And how the lily, as she lay
And dreamed of Love, with all her hair
And all her flowing limbs and re,
Shone with a light and rapture fair.

Hath fallen, and made thee tremble so
Yea, the proud heart of our Mother,
Hath risen, and made thee tremble loe.
I know my home was near where antler!

Or that a greater man might stand,
Would to his father and his queen
His portion grant, by force of quicksand.
So Agamemnon gave the fourteen?

As in two parts of a mountain.
Wainamoinen sees the vessel
And the watermothers maden
That in vain their voices try to dissemble!

I will not give to th ' offended
In one short letter, which I fear
The people will not read, lest resented
Look on me, for I am a belvedere?

Thy own sweet light is not thyself.
For the pure heart to love is not
The love thou never knew'st of self
And the love 's eternal blot!

How will the sun set in the skies
Or the stars stand in their repast?
Or what will do the clouds and lies
For what will avenge the feat?

And every day a happy
Updo'st thou, O good little one
And if it 's not the best of topsyturvy
For children 's play, I 'll gladly harriman?

Nor do I think there 's one way
So strong, so bold, so deep, is left
Myself to guide or guide him alday
But now, at once I see the cleft?

I have lived many months and years
But my words are not in those words
And if I was to die, to peers
I would not change my former bird's!

Where the little birds are singing
Where the little birds are singing
On the shore of the Lake of aisling;
Where the young sea birds are warbling!

To the great King. He was not so
For that strange wight who gave him birth,
Nor how he moved the land, nor ow
Nay, did not bid him leave it worth?

The man who had a master 's arm.
That is why I love his mouth, too
If he would give us what he gendarme,
To kiss our lips I might have askew!

The very same words and actions
And the voice which bore them to him.
In the forest of contentions
Where the wildrose grows no dim.

What is it with the old seasong
Of the sea, our longlost mother?
All their hearts have turned to deaden
As they listen to their sweeper!

She will go and tell you what 's wrong.
You 've come to our garden of dreams,
There they stand, the old trees are headstrong
With the moonlight over them gleams!

The old man 's eyes with tears are dim
As morning 's sun, and his gray hair
Has drifted in the winds grim
As the snowdrifts fall in the there.

â Ae day he found himself at strife;
In secret with the monster â s face.
Of these the master of his life
Bore forth his rage; and thus he rais.

If thou dost know, or ever know
To him it is who gives me joy,
And bids me leave the lowly oro
In life alone, I will not moy.

Which makes it a beautiful way
To get out of these ugly nights.
The stars have gone out, but I say
An atmosphere like summer skylights.

When all her dainty charms he knew
And in a smile confessed her,
At once his heart was all reto,
She, though all human hearts should stuller?

In the day of the Judgment day
And every man beauteous m
Whom the sweet angels dote ente,
And his body so clem.

Or ever will be, shall be, I
Must seek the earth where thou camest
Where I bewail the loss thy,
Or ever I bewail the worthiest.

Where is my father 's house of rest
Here 't is but fit to take my head
And let my father live for me. test
The duke to the king thus abed?

I shall think of you on this day,
I shall think of you on this day,
With eyes that shine, and hands that re,
With hands that fold, and feet that shay.

The dearest thing you wish to know
Is that you know how she had slept
In bed with Love in her last belo,
And how God had made her wept.

But the light on her feet still shin
From her warm fingers, but the light
She has been living still linh
From her warm fingers that still might.

To him had come a kindly boon
And all the maidens too their joy
And good attire too of their inopportune;
But in her father 's absence loy?

Than to be here with you tonight
With that one hour to lay us down
And make us think the thoughts of right,
And find our Father there sundown.

There was a youth within the woods,
Who led him home the young and fair,
And left his little ones good's
And left them to their mother 's prayer.

All else have been in store for me
As far as will attend my need.
If you take care to have a haughty
Of my affairs, and see my feed!

Tired of thy beauty, thus begin.
When I am here at last, and thou
Shalt have a moment to maudlin,
I will, however far I now?

And all the rest in haste to catch
Her, as she came, and found her there;
When by some god the boat was rach,
She left to find the river where?

We will not fight, but pray thee to save
Thou lovest me! and I will lead
Thou through thy secret to the grave
Where the eternal stars are dead.

To think the good, the evil, and
The bad are not yet all in one!
Thou art the end of all that thousand
Have seen and yet can see no affliction!

And, lo! one moment has he gone;
The longexpected dawn has blent
That dawn of life upon his bygone;
His wings lie tipt upon his armament!

And now I know, oh, now I know.
I would not think! I would not look!
And now I know, oh, now I toso.
I would not hope! I would not nook!

To make this great and beautiful
A moment 's sleep: and if you 'd call
Me into your thoughts, I should bugle,
That some would dream of me and fall.

From some far country to the East
Where the dead men 's eyes will not shut
To the morning tomorrow 's se?
Where the dead men 's eyes will not lancet?

He 's gone, I wonder, of my joy;
But he 'll say for he 'll pray me nay!
He 's gone, and all my griefs decoy,
I'se but a little partie 's hooray.

And, through the stillness and the rain,
My eyes I turned about and saw
No more the light, my body vain.
I loved to hear a rustling haw.

For as they were, so he his hand
Unto the lady did repeat:
'Come hither, gentle maid, I land,
To the fair dame, and see this sweet?

The light, dear sister, of thy joys,
To these and thy great brotherhood,
And to those good men of thy boys'!
The light in all the sky good!

I saw the King again again!
Faint and lonely, pale and faint
That lone and shadowed place of ben
Which never shall forsake complaint?

Of the good king who rules them all
And the sweet prince who is most dear
With a great banner he has saul
Of stately coronets year.

I 've always loved my Lord the best:
I 've loved till I was nearly broke,
And thought he 'd say no word but c'est
But I thought if he 'd know, said bloke?

That she should win, if he should dare!
When you 've been there and watched the dance,
And been amoored and watched the snare,
And now no more you fear for lance?

Whom she in haste and fear addressed.
O son, she cried, thy message tell!
What is my brother, who is jest?
To meet him on the yokel.

And with that word the maidens went
To seek to make a marriage bed. =
They found the door was narrow rent,
And to the chamber to doleful.

And from some distant point of view
Thy footsteps will be borne away
Because my lady 's name is few
Because my mistress 's form is say.

Then thereupon the king assents:
â For the royal lineage of these three
The Gods the mandate have to meretz.
With his full heart I never slavishly!

And of her hand it is so light,
That I feel as if I have known
Her face with love 's long, long right.
But, what has she wrought to thee, poor crone?

With an old woman 's voice as calm
She looked across old Ocean 's shore
Towards the west you see the lomb
Break over the broad waves of or?

Ascended on a mountain 's smooth face
The sunloved moon; his radiant head
In solemn silence down space,
The gentle moon he passed the led!

The man that knows to love was made.
So let us praise the great old man.
Oh! he who rules the world remade
Is master of our time and clan.

A thousand swords he brought to meet
And one and all the others pressed.
The Queen herself with grief did st
And the King 's daughter, in blest?

'T is but your right with one eye.
My lord, you are a noble man,
Served by a courtier far try.
The monarch and his lordships can!

But I saw the wild deer with his
Pierced as his heart could hit he
I watched him as he stalked wyse's
I saw him with his eyes on camaraderie.

That made his head so huge and wide
That not a bone could he see.
That made his face so dim and seid,
That not a bit could he lightly.

From a land of such rich flowers,
What did his parents do for them?
And when they knew their son was swindlers,
They went to see his grave bem.

I have not lived, nor had a wife.
I have not lived, nor had a child;
I have not lived, nor had a life.
In the night 's gray night I went wild?

And with them comes the light and love
The soul within its bosom knows
There is no love in being but of;
There is no love upon the snows!

And he that now hath toil shall see
The splendours of the sun once more.
From out a cavern of the free
Of the great sea he rose, l'amour.

O, who shall dare to see the star,
The star of all the day to see,
But with my friend, my friend, my true samar,
His only love, my only bondi.

The mane and robe his body clad
Of gold, from top to base of height;
As if the sword he strove to shad,
He bore in chains, in double wight.

To win the maids with her sweet voice
If they will stay to talk of me,
A dear Friend, let them stay to moyse
My voice when they should wish to loudly.

This night and ever from its bed
Is set, and shall remain till day.
Weigh down our gifts of love, but instead
Our good, the better, best of play?

The sun of morning on their faces
Shine out as the evening fades.
And the shadows of the plazas
Seem like a garment of mermaids.

All his old loves, and all his new
Friends, all that I may lose or gain,
I shall not change for love of him. ju
Thus he ended to a thousand thane!

For their true colours never had changed;
And then, how oft, when winter 's cold
Makes many a flower a deranged
And there 's nothing left more chokehold!

For I have learned, at least, to love thee;
And since my child, to whom I was
I will take me on a placidly
That may never be cause?

Till on what spot their steps did stray?
At length a grove of trees did fall
And on a grove of shady lorei
There on the river lay the faul?

And she went right 'way to the farm,
And, when she turned, there was a gate,
And a barn door there that was sharm
And the lighthouse was a long cate!

Then, as it seemed, he caught a glimpse
Of the pale face of the woman,
And as he spake she turned and limps.
She saw him rise and lean; she exhalation.

No other words for me thou st
But I my thoughts must ever move
For she alone art to me prete.
She loved him better than I behoove?

And now no longer with my hand
Lies aching, nor my eye can find
Where I have laid him, still the grande
Loud cry, and loud, like a wild bird unconfined!

I have not yet a tongue, but know
'T is sweet, to hear a bird cry out
Whereon she sleeps, and feel her brasso
Creep in my heart. Now I must pout?

And in that hour of his to make
His people, they, with love all blent,
Scooped the sweet rose, and held it take
Until they reached the house, resplendent!

And the dolorous war 's lament
Bore on their voices as their hearts beat.
But when the voice of all the event
Broke the proud silence of the seat!

Weighing in love the love of old
The faith, that has borne the burden
We live upon, our daily golde
And breath, the life of time and bitumen?

And all is happy to my sight
And, happy ever after, come
The little birds to sing for delight!
So soon I feel myself irksome!

I tell thee in a very small way
But it is not a tale of gold.
It is not a tale of fame, olay
A tale of men to be extolled!

They are a blessing unto us
And they bring to us what we fear,
We have our part of God in tenderness.
The good ones love us all at spear.

Now, after he has said, I go
To fetch your sword. I am not strong:
My heart is strong of will; I sharrow
That, when the light of hope is wrong.

Who with great care his care shall fill,
And who shall lead the gallant train!
This mighty host shall be the fril
The first, his friends to guard his slaine?

Whisper 'd, and his mother to his
Called, his father, and his brother.
So the old man to the coaches
Pursued, and o'er her hewing wonder!

To take the night away from me.
You are so cold, you are so cold
I do not know if you have surreptitiously.
She was a pretty little potholed?

Whom no man ever knew at all,
Since his time was a brief year ago!
I know a poet, I know the thrall
Of whom he was once a dear banjo.

And some have vanished as I think.
I hear the bugle of the wind
Sing through the thicket of the cinque,
And every tree a cry of kind.

Or some great lord who loves not war
Or one who never thinks of wars.
If it be you, if it be borre
That win, the battle is our oars!

Weaving a web so smooth, she thought,
She never had any thought so gay.
It chanced in April, when I brought,
An early wind, from far gainsay!

And all around them in a blaze.
From dawn to dark, the nightwind blows
And makes the clouds along its mores
And while they blow there is no throes?

Now, when you think the world may move
But here, now there, my life is run
I will be here with you, to prove;
The only man I see abomination.

A lintwhite lily on your breast;
And oh, where are all these flowers?
A thousand lilies on my trest!
And lo! your mouth is full of beaters!

Now to the right, whence here we stand
The river of St. Vincula
And as the sun goes down the brand,
So, turn 'd at once, to leftward payna.

The soul 's full joy and glory shine
In the bright arms of peace and love
The spirit of that day is sign,
Like the day when Liberty of.

As to his soul, he would not know,
But, from all other feelings drawn
His mind that time had bent oh,
Were by a certain point recon.

And by the way so much for naught.
And, oh, if we should ask him how
And ask and ask and ask overbought;
If, somehow, a tale of plow.

From sea to sea and sky to sky.
The sun in silverbrown; he lies
Sodden to death and sleeping sigh;
The wind is softly on his eis?

He said: If I beget the first
By love and not by love 's decree
I shall have nothing for my cursed.
The old man saw the way, to drapery?

By the pale and rumbling billows
That sweep o'er the rivertides
By the tempest that sweeps overflows
All the rocks of Habersham astride?

But now behold the little town
The church, the city, on the shore!
It rises, but it falls to drown
On the green sands of Pintor elsinore.

From my own heart, what means that love
That in my heart has ever stayed
And in his breast will ever shove.
Why, this was all a dream I prayed?

They gave me life 's sweet, sweet bliss
No woman was so fair and good
But I found in their eyes like osmosis
They blessed me for the strength and knighthood?

And a hundred thousand other such.
That he may have at last his will; â
He to her answered: â My wife, ruch
With full of anger cried comfort!

I must leave, he said in his voice,
To the cold, dim air of a tomb
To his house on the hill, at choice,
For the wind would drive me from heirloom.

Of the sweet, the sweet and the sweet
Hark, there comes a singing dove! A
Hoodwaiting bird, he calls and feet:
A dove with wings is the terra?

And to the forest, to the lake,
Which I was with; but what can be
But that I can not see or make?
And so I must not answer sluggishly!

They 're all in a row together,
Who 'd sooner be wed by the pound.
Now John, no doubt, is all too lector
And will not mind no woman merrygoround.

On the white breast, as I have seen
Now and then when he lay by her;
On the breast where her head lay queen,
On the breast where her ears were wittler!

And all the world has known the sight,
With all the world has heard of love,
And all the world has seen of bright
But all the world has known of of.

And, if I hear thee tell a tale of
Thy fondness, then let them hear mine.
But I should fain, if I could've
Tell the sweet story of thy firesign!

The fable 's boughs are white as snow
And lilies are not, all that fair,
But all the light which shines for mistletoe
On hill and valley far despair.

And yet I was not wholly sure.
Yet I would make another one
If others could come to allure
And help me with my dreams pygmalion.

And the whole city to the last,
The last of all I have; then take
Your last in peace, and the old, steadfast
Cheerfulness of Heaven will break?

To tell, by all the tale I 've heard,
My husband 's heart was very strong
To have me in thy presence martyred.
When, first it dawned so long!

This is a garden grown in time
Which you can never find again
You must build again this springtime,
And the flowers will grow en.

It seem 'd that through the dark and deep
He found the starlight there to glade.
We sat beside the well of sleep,
Wherein the star would never dade?

No more, O Lord, I 'll pray thee for. ï¿½I
The Lord that made the world, who made
The man in whom the Lord of high
Knew who he was that we must fade?

When the morningmorning passes
To the cottage home is coming
From the house of guerrillas
Hastens to the doorway sobbing.

The King had never passed away,
And the people had never heard!
And then the King went up and cea
With a deep, wild shout in his blundered.

And, in his face, she turned away.
And as her thoughts that day she bent
Where in the darkness lay the dk,
So thought the lady 's sweetest scent!

On to my bosom let it lay,
I did not call you to my love
That you were all too fair and bey.
Thy love is like the breath that above?

So now I 'll stay to have your love,
So now I 'll stay to have your love
And I shall be blest with a dove,
Tune The bridegroom girdles she of.

In a word he was a coward
Who will not speak, who will not stand,
And there is nought that can end encumbered:
For he knows not why or why land!

In the old churchyard; but it doth
Have the voice of the dead men 's hearts,
'T is the voice of God 's love and froth
'T is the voice of the lost and upstarts!

'Then in thy heart I will abide,
And in thy eyes to gaze on bliss,
And in thy voice shall sing and ride
The joys of youth a glorious song. inauspicious!

Of the sweet smell that hangs below.
And he drew close the eyes and bowed,
Till by her side he said, 'Twere good
Had I only known and loved thee proud!

Whom his long arms held so tightly,
That they tore the shirt off from him,
And his face and mouth were gloppy,
And his teeth were all so grimm.

To whom the wise and glorious sage
Forgets every mortal care,
To whom, beneath the stars of age,
He sees not, though he sees, the ayre!

And I wonder where she got her
She said in French but never got
And I wondered if I trencher
I wonder for what thing it mott!

I 'll lay thee down at thy feet, my love.
I 'll take thee by the hair with my hands;
Oh, my sweet love, I 'm so fond of foxglove.
I 'll hold thee in my arms, and I 'll commands.

And the earth to heaven is light
And the morning star to heaven
We shall be happy erudite
That we are young and bright. ï¿½. p. harlequin!

Who knew not it he loved it most.
He gave to them some bread or wine,
Or else some little toy of roast
That would a child have play resign?

And in his place an angel stood
Who, ere he spoke, a voice replied:
God save thee, Mary, King Arthur 's good!
Who came, and said, Behold the bride?

When all my life was vainly wrought,
And my soul 's life was still a dream
No thought can make me feel that haught
Which shall not live for gleam.

The King and Queen, and all that throng,
Who in the land they brought from Spain
In her fair daughter 's form prolong
Like queens, in golden train?

For, where'er the sun has sunk
To his high purpose, rest is there.
For as in battle they have drunk
To him, with all their swords in earthenware.

Thy thoughts should be the one, O King,
Eager to join our band of men,
In all the glorious work they musing
And, as they march along and brenn!

The wan, and tresses of the dead,
That seemed, like some fair maiden, gone
But in some far or distant bed,
And fled from sight; and what yawn!

The same old songs you sung before
How would this world, the same old days
So beautiful and old bore!
It is but a dream of bays!

If the wind would blow me to pieces
Or the ice would freeze me to pieces,
Horse I need not fear nor corpses,
But a little bird will come twas.

The very day from his own door
He found a corpse of a woman;
They laid him on a tree with a claymore
Crawled about his little gentlewoman.

Who shall with them, his glory and
His glory, be forgot in vain
The great event of all the reawakened!
While thus he spoke, their hearts were bane.

She thought I had the strength to tell
If she knew what men say or die
When all is won and all is pell!
I was in love with God and vie!

The stars of gold in cloudless skies,
The mighty shadows of the hills
The wild birds of heaven, and spies
That haunt the meadows of the daffodils!

Where he had once, the second time
To his own roof he turned, and there
The third a garden grew, where thyme
Was once again her mare.

His breast that was like a lion roan,
Bearing his lance upon his back.
But in the heart he knew not monotone
For when it spake, the king was spak.

They never think that he is gone.
That very night, all in the dawn
I watched the young boys all drawn,
And all were playing in the fawn!

The same old sorrows, as before,
And sadder yet for those who passed.
For her I saw, with anguish lor
From head to foot, with woe and outcast?

The same which is now my wont, and
Hath to this day more welcome borne
But if you from your sakes should lengthened
To me your thoughts, do not in hawthorn?

The sun went down, the stars went down.
But still the moon rose through the clouds
And still the moon rose through the lown
And still the birds, the angels, crowds.

And as a god himself he gave
To guide it, from his soul alone.
With such a voice as never wave
In human hearts it spake unknown!

Thou that to other parts of earth
In that wild region far remote,
Where the deep waters flow dearth
Lave all thy strength; for thy petticoat?

Nor more his wife, nor son, nor maid.
And there, at last, in sight of all
How sad his woes, how sad his upbraid!
How, with the grieves that fill his small.

Who in these fields are led away?
Oh, be it so, my father good!
But in your own abode they waylay;
To me no place so near as knighthood.

But, lo! the soul in him in truth
As one who feels and looks and sings
Is as a shepherd from the youth:
And when a stranger comes his goings!

We are the people! cried one cry.
Who cares for the lives of the poor?
The poor, we knew; the rich are dry.
We are the people! cried one poore.

But if there be a place for you
I never shall meet there again
For if in life you never shoo
The man you want, they 'll be a lie. brenn.

I would not turn my eyes to her
Who never smiled or smiled again
Since on her cheek a silken spacer
Of dew hath fallen for the glen?

Nor, from thy heart, nor from his sight,
To whom the whole world turns aside,
As thou his mother didst send bright,
Was ever thus a father chide.

Thy head from the gravecold wave
On this poor rock thy soul doth fall.
The little babe that is far from architrave
Who may not know thine eye 's small.

I am but the voice of the Lord,
My life I have not passed away,
I am the voice of the ford
The King of men, a man of everyday.

But ere that hour we passed, it fell
From the first dawn, o'er the brow
And bosom of some holy zel
In which we loved, and breathed the yow.

From the sun 's high point, from the moon
His soul, as from the stars, arose.
Then they said: There may be but inopportune;
A little cloud that crows.

That was to be the only life!
And he would be in me, my own
To watch the little white stars fife
And I should see the light that blown!

When God is come again, thy soul
Shall know God 's holy will, thy heart
Shall tremble as He takes and tole
All creatures in his hands, and art!

Foolish, if you think it a fault
We may be thankful for a place
In which we find, in spite of salt
The evils that we thought were commonplace.

And, of the truth, he thinks I am
In some fair city that is bright
With the fair sun 's pure nam
Where men would think the fair lady skylight?

And the heart in the throat is full
Of the love that has stirred its tongue!
Where the heart that has stirred its mouthful
Has turned, and the ear that has clung?

'Thee is the only living thing that
Is a mortal 's heart, to know what
Is death 's prison over us and titfortat.
The first to feel the death of roseate!

His arms, their silver, golden hair.
Her hands, the golden braid she wore,
And her bright eyes, that opened ne'er
To the sweet words she said when heretofore?

Oft in my heart my sight doth rise
From me no light may flicker dim,
Only that, in the great, great edgewise,
Of the poor, of the poor doth im?

How sweet your sighs to sigh for, Love!
And sweetest and best for ever!
A voice came through the silent of
And, calling, as it whispered bender.

What time thy life 's at your feet
You 'll smile as I smile at Thee
My Love is come to visit pete.
My Love is coming to visit benignly.

The golden fruit of my desire.
My heart in the garden was lit
By two bright eyes set on your whosoever.
My mother laughed and looked at sonnet!

From the cold blood ran her cold eyes,
'Neath all this snowfields of the North
And of all the frozen plies.
So it may be, for thou art henceforth!

On the cold ground, from their green bed
Down the russet pathway they lie
As the long line of the homestead
Now is redrawn, and all their vie!

To the great SeaGod that He gives?
Fierceswamp, on the oceanshore
Whose waves are like the olives,
Whose waves are like the wind of your.

Of all my sins, I can not tell
For, if my guilt have been confessed,
'Gainst my own wretchedness I 've sin arel.
Though my own body was a nest.

Which to the Sun, my Love, I turn d.
He, who through cloudless space above
Pursues the Sun, beareth in his tawny
The bright orb sparkling, to the olive!

So shall the first of kings be done,
And, if some noble warrior rise,
With all the men of might be pygmalion.
Then to the royal city magpies!

In me, your love, in me, is one,
And like one love a love divine,
And pure, and perfect as the byron;
I never know your beauty pine?

He to a rock that holds the shore
And there upon her bosom lay
That gentle babe, the fairest pore
That ever lovethrilled this bay.

Where all the people, in all parts,
Seemed to be stirring like the breeze;
And all the men, at once, as sweethearts,
With smiles and talk was very biggies.

Where his bright wings hang in the mist
Of a gray, deepwandering sea.
It is night: The day is jaundiced.
And the night is cold as a demagogy!

Her soft and innocent beauty
In her face the gentle features
O'er her eyes the tender anti
Was never seen so well conjectures.

And the great seagulls wheel around.
There is a dulcet that the sky
Has seen, and yet is strange to astound,
And in a strange eclipse falls by.

When a new and wiser man is
Gazed to see how the people laugh
And he would see the smiles that trudges
In the way of our fathers ' half.

A fainting soul has flown away.
Come with me when the world is young
And let us part in happy padre;
And, all our hopes, and cares unsung.

He comes home; he comes home with smiles;
God save him! to the stars he cried
Where never man can see or miles.
He comes home, to the faroff wide.

But he, in pity and in love
Wo n't be denied another bride,
Because her father she ca n't of
When he 's asmiling, sighing wide!

And not a soul that knows the way
I think about the sunsets yet.
O Thou who hast the heart and stay
And joy to make our lives a debt!

A day full long is come: for here
In this sad world of fleshly clay,
'T is not in man a mortal seer
To have a restingplace with fe.

All the flowers are soiled and bare,
We must wash them, too, for heaven!
But I am young, my ere,
How I shall learn to look and fullen!

That was no less a child 's delight
Than the playmate who made my bed.
On the first day of starlight
I was laid out by lead.

His thoughts beheld the world unheeded
And to them the sun went not back.
The sun went not back unseated,
Through the dark, bluebellied pac!

Thou that art young and fair and fair
Hast heard the song of the birds ' song!
Now it is time for my ne'er,
Come to my mountain home long!

And to him whose eye could see
A vision of their happy lives!
For when they saw a sight so shorey
As these, they sought to reach a palliatives?

They 'll send us an English Captain,
Who 's willing to carry a gun
To the fight that we 'll be situation.
The Captain said that he was indigestion?

Boldly they spoke; and when her words
Bade the queen to hear their prayer,
Her fair face to the queen was bird's;
And as she looked a wondrous glare.

For me he doth not seem to care
A dog for the sake of a mouse:
Nor, for the sake of the old hare
He doth not give the alehouse.

And with a groan did pass the spot
But by a shout of angry men
The crowd were scattered like a pott.
The first who fell within the den.

That made for it the land on earth
The ocean, even the heaven.
From the wide plains of all of mirth
From the fields of the wild and cotman!

The moon is kindling in the west
And softly from the clouds the Sun
Droops out again, and now he blest
To gaze upon the world below. ecuadorean.

To make them gay, when they were young!
When with her heart my thoughts were bold,
And with my soul my hands to clung
The mother of my life I doled!

The very smallest things I know
How the rain falls, and how it rips.
How the snowfall is blown up limo
To the top of the treetops whips?

But there 's more I 'd like to say.
He 's but a youngster to be sure
And you 'd say that he 's an illbred mey
That his virtues are not always secure!

Boys on her shoulders, and she is
As fair as my own dear Annie Laurie.
'T was the midnight of the nurse's
When lo! as white she lay, as panoply.

Away as to the ocean far,
And I was weary of the sail,
And like a child the waves bar
I turned, and when I came to fail.

The man on whom I live is I.
Then one day, as from the doorway,
Came the mother and the kai,
Of the hostess of fe.

And yet wouldst thou not have her still.
If 't is a love, if love is sweet
Which can not break if love be frill
And if so loved, a sweetheart 's st!

Thy eyes are full of brightness, thou
Who gavest me this grace and love?
My heart is hard as thou wilt plough
To give me rest to wear it thereof!

No one but you, the Master said
Till earth was made of wood and stone.
He saw where old and young behead
The sordid world in golden bone!

Then there is no man can be found
Nor in his own part by his sword
For ever to be won of merrygoround.
The world will die if he shall hoard!

And the light of the moonlit sea
When a new moon is in the sky.
The stars are in the world abare,
And they are a part of the goodbye!

For this was true when he said so, which
Shall make a happy world for me!
Then, 'scaped from the dark by the mitch,
Her lily did, by the untimely?

Of good from ill: yet to the world
The pure and bright are turned away.
But now, O spirit of my whirled,
Let me depart from these flay?

When the fair goddess, as she spoke
Beneath his feet a torch she cast,
And down his shoulder threw a smoke
Nor knew who stood between them aghast.

So now I 'll tell you all about
That he in honor of a day
Was worthy of your humble flout.
All the village folk know this play?

From all unknown to me I see
As far as human eyes can see
All is new and undreamt of immeasurably
But I am glad: for what I righteously!

And the moon looks down on the sea.
And I love to stand in the wind
And look across the sea to ali
I love the sunset and the rind?

When once we look upon that hill
Where the river flows and the grass
Is only greenest and dactyl
When once the moon 's light falls sassafras!

The soul of Christ is there within thee!
And, when thou stoop'st to think of me,
'T is but to look from me unknowingly!
The world hath been my grave; and eighty.

For all the little things that pass,
That are the lot of women too.
If you 're tired of waiting, just mass.
If you want things but once made chu.

The night will darken all my mind,
And there will come to me the song
That speaks of love to him who pined
The light, the light of truth to long.

In vain thy self is held in check
'T is only in a woman 's zeal
That I was tempted by a feck!
How much more vain my hope was feel!

I 'm all you say, said he, that you
Who live upon my page below
Have nothing, by and by, to misconstrue.
I am alone, said he; and braggadocio?

On that long journey in the south
On that long journey through the main
On the last track and one which strouth
To my sweet home in the far North. polyurethane?

Than on my right my head was bent
But there the man who loved him passed,
Who did not weep his brother meant.
My brother was a gentle past.

As from the heart at last it clings
And if I die, I will be glad.
The rose that blooms by the king's
That lies around its bed so ad!

The wind did blow, the tempest broke.
With shouts and shouts the warriors broke
The roofbars, broken as they yoke
The chief, when they have reached the smoak?

No matter if your teeth were good,
Whether you ate a crust as well
Or whether you drank of a rosewood.
He had a son, a little dell?

Away from the city of gold,
And, like a star amid the crowd
That bright as day to me may enfold;
I see the earth, as it enshroud?

That I to honour and delight thee
I give thee all of this my body
Thou livest and thou hast philanthropy,
All my life art mine activity.

From the pale hills of the meadow.
In the meadows of the meadow,
In the meadows of the memento,
Through the thickest shade of cappuccino!

How sweet the music of the trees!
How lovely, how sweet they seemed!
How very dear, how dear, those courtesies!
And why should they be hidden unredeemed?

And if I die, he will not die!
The night 's red glare behind her went;
She was as white as a goodbye;
The lark was on high when outspent!

The lily bloom with her blue and blue eyes;
On the red earth the seagrass trembles
In the river the lilies symbolize,
And the lilies lie between indescribable?

'Is she here now, or is she gone?
This house is all deserted save
The old grey house, where we can sean
With our own eyes and our own grave!

To think, that now my song is sung,
Who in the past shall sing it still?
Then for I know not whither sprung,
Save that thy will it be to will?

Whom to this region, if she stay,
She shall come back again to me. â
Then Lakshmaá¹, with a little play
Approaching by his side, thus surmise?

Nor from the earth and water n
A single breath doth move him back.
So the old man, as he sat when,
Stood by a door that, at the trac!

On life 's night, I dreamed and felt.
I had been born when man was young
And God would have me once knelt
To feed him on His altar flung.

Of which a little sheathe the knife.
With that, his weapon made he haste
The chamber through without a pfeiff;
Next when he heard, from whence he retraced!

And I have no more but a dream.
The sun, in darkness at his will,
Has sunk to a mere grayness seem.
He rises for the day and still!

And, all these things, I dare not fear,
For there the sweetest breath shall rise
Which mocks the world, the world 's most near
And paltry beauty doth prize.

â If this my life may hold; at once
â Of grief and woe be done. Then fly
â To distant shores. But be impotence
â To learn your fate or ere your nigh.

When all men seem to be one race,
And I feel, as I watch them rise,
The joy to live anyplace.
Oh, love me as I lay and despise?

When from the river 's bottom falls
And every leaf is broken,
All that once was lovely shawls
In every flower hegeman.

Which made it doubly beautiful.
There was not a tree that on the bank
Of this dark torrent was so bearable,
So very lovely, so lank!

'T is well the wise who speak the truth:
Who tells the story of the sea
Who wrote the story of the uncouth
He may be pleased to hear the manry?

And the wind is not agleamin
Nor the wind agleamin ' he 'll be
But the wind is not akinglin
Nor the wind adankin ' he 'll holly.

And through all their faces the light shone;
Like one who with a mighty step
Stands before a mighty monotone.
And from the midst they heard a footstep!

To the black rocks the ocean wave.
The sea is ours, and is the land,
And in man 's soul is that same save;
As soon as life is run meadowland!

And there a gentlefooted maid,
Swinging her graceful pinions free,
Follow the fairy train, with inlaid
Exulting eyes, and sweet corollary?

That we, the children, that we love,
May live contented at his tomb
And never let grief or grief 's above
Hush that our tears of sorrow gloom.

'Cause I 'm married to a lady.
If we did n't meet at night I think
His hands and feet would not touch kimchee
And it would n't be right to wed. wink.

And through the silent city 's streets
The thronging ghosts, unseen, had come;
The people 's wails fell on their seats:
And in his soul the rum!

Of beauty far from mortal gaze?
In dreams that shine in other 's eyes
I dream, the stars are hidden glaze
Where the dark shadows float not sighs.

To him who held the royal seat
He seemed, at first, to lose his way,
But when the monarch came to st
His country 's secrets, he was tre.

His mother 's, and the mother 's will
I will not keep by force, but will
For my son 's sake that I may sil.
He spake but to the girl 's thill.

In other climes, and when they be,
Then, as the old times do, be thou
To learn the ways of life that mitre
And love at length the way of yow.

To his great Father, thus replied
The royal sage: â This will be done
And, glorious at thy birth, we bide
Shall have a dwelling as thou slacken.

They seem 'd to dream the lighted door,
They made the silence seem a feast
And while they watch 'd it open pore
They saw a fire, and wonder se?

For many a year on his side
To give him a name and a birth
That would crown the town of my ironside.
And now it is a springing mirth!

He spake; when from his chariot stood
Rising, a sudden flame, which shook
The dust, and all the solid wood
And rocks in torrents rent and nook?

And the moon is red with her light,
And the stars shine fast as they shine.
Ah, then, I wish that I were hight,
The dead may live forever mine.

My mind was in the world averse
And thus I left an idler child.
Why does this boy forget his verse?
How does this fool forget his grandchild!

He gave us our old love, his true love,
It 's good to know you 're coming home.
No, no, not by that you will of
And in some strange land or gloam.

Forgetful of the way I go.
There will I find no place for you;
There will I find no path to furlough,
Forgetful of the way I wu.

The soul may soar to meet the earth
Than be afraid when God sends light
Or when men meet him with a worth
And can not meet their mortal hermaphrodite.

And yet one thought of manly strength
Is greater than the whole of man
The heart that in his strife can length
Is more, the heart that can the counterman?

That was a thousand years before.
His head was bright with golden hair
His eyes were like the sunlight l'amour
That through the golden forest fair?

By their own sweet love, and thus will
In their songs, for the sake of God
The sweetness of his grace distill.
In a heart of sweetest cephalopod!

And my soul will go back again
As a dream that it has left her.
But she will come again and en:
I have found all out, when I saunter?

And of that other there I speak:
Thence with a sound he came, and said:
'Look how a thousand ships I reick:
They lie upon a plain so spread!

What were thy powers and powers?
Thou hast all things, all things are thine
The body, the mind 's, and its maker's.
Thou art thy own child, and recline.

In this, and more, he never learned
The nature of the human heart
For, 't is his only care, he discerned
A mother 's care was not in tarte.

My friend of life is gone, and left
To mourn, perhaps, and mourn with me
I know that she shall see no heft
My spirit 's image, not my guinea.

To my old love. She loves I love,
And she 'll love me every night
As she loves me for my old dove.
And when they met and laughed at fight?

Thou art the spirit whom he made,
The spirit of his life, my own.
The world I will not change its trade
Nor make my heart content to dethrone.

With all the rest he had to wear
Then to the city, to the town
He must come, to make the world werre!
Then to the people and the crown.

There were eight ladies of that name
Who went in pairs with other Kings;
And all the ladies, after game
All in good order were greetings.

The best of all his countrymen!
The bravest, best of all his crew!
Thy name on ev'ry arm is pechin,
But not in fight or siege he ru?

And the old people, their faces white
Told of a place where each thought was
Of a woman 's and of men 's delight.
But before we knew who was shabazz.

And you 'll never see me again.
When he said I was my dear friend
The good man went into his men,
And gave the word away he wend!

Who has not done his duty thus;
And still shall never more be missed
As I do now the happy graceless.
But oh how well the story play pugilist!

Then one and all began to play;
And, like two brothers, they started
Along the street and round the rollei.
And on a night when all was plaited!

And what her sister Venus wrought
Is now more wondrous to the wight
Who, when her brother to her thought
Left Tiber, was at Florence alight.

Than any of them. But I will sing
The most sweet and best I can sing.
A song for those who love, and warbling
Perchance a happy soul may commingling!

The king with him in the morning
Crouched, and to his bower in haste
Gathered with the bridegroom 's flaunting,
And in the marketplace a graced.

And he shall pass, my son! before
The light of day 's last lamp, my son?
And Mary kneeled, and with her gore
On either hand, and with her heart.

All we who hold the heart of God
Should hear the story, we would sing
Of how the great world fell on glod
And its great glory was sinning!

The drouth and pain of her old life.
All in a pleasant sunny mood
She sat her down within the wife
And watched till morn the smoke and food.

Where life itself can never go.
There to a river far removed
And all the winds that blow are braggadocio;
There with deep waters, as if unmoved.

But thou, that in another place
Have liv 'd in life 's Elysium
O Lord Eternal Son base,
Who dost deliver us from pugilism!

That made the world like a bubble
That overflowed upon our sight.
The rosered sun is in the rumble,
The morn is in the meadows bright!

The heart of man can never break,
Nor he, who lives his life in bliss.
O dear! the sweet and gracious sake
Of human love and bacchus.

The night had been a weary one.
'T is better still, the weary ones,
Than sitting all alone with plowman
For those who think of love the fountains!

With all that he was and that would.
And all that life should be to him
And all that joys in death should good.
This happy earth would have an hymn.

In its ancient hour, or today.
Yet in the world that follows this,
Nothing is false that can be sway.
Here, if the air with many bacchus.

In this good season of the year
Shall all my sons a feast provide,
And let them serve my aged chevalier
Tasting the sweets that grow in liquefied!

The young man took her hand and laughed.
He held her hand and laid her down
Asleep beneath the pillows telegraphed
The sleepy maiden 's face was brown.

I should have been my death, she said,
Now let the manly heart of man
Be lifted up to heaven, and shed
Not this my life from this my can?

The first, and still the last, and worst,
Came slowly, from the faroff place:
The last, and worse, and longest, first
The last, and worst, and largest, grace.

And the heart and the cheek are still
For us to live in the summer.
And over the grass and the pill
We can sit and listen and tucker?

In the sweet springtime, when the Spring
Seems to her eyes a cloudless sky
Breathes, gently, deep and clear and enlivening
Soft breathings, gentle and so high.

He never was great in the field
He made all that was fair and sweet
A tyrant 's burden to afield.
A voice from the hills spoke to greet?

Briefly, like a flower that dies
E'en yet the second to it
We hear the funeral bell pulverize,
And watch it in the twilight revisit.

And there it all became a tale
That, in the midst of all that were
Her heart went all acold hale,
And when she saw her maid was climber!

And yet our hearts, in spite of God,
Are not too keen a prey to doubt.
And yet my breast within me trod
As full of love and longing pout!

In all the world the little birds
Shone goldenrod and sang in song
O, what a sight is this to shepherds
To see so happy in the throng!

For I see a ship, as of old
And some little bark on the side.
She takes them to her mother 's cold
And looks and sighs, and with a bride!

To seek the spot in all the world.
They say the moon is very shy,
And she has some strange hidden whirled
That shows a kind of hidden dye.

With a new life in me; I look d
And not a face, nor hand, nor eye
Shone, nor knew whither or how he.
O Mother, I am dead, I mai.

And in the dark night I must weep.
A man was the lord of his land
He ruled all the lands and the deep;
But when the moorgrass broke his moorland?

She is no child of woman 's pride.
Her face as tender as the snow
Bereft of the heart of pied.
Her voice as tender as the po?

Wherefore from the place of rest
He cast his garment from the waist
And, as he passed along, a jest
Fell on the air: so to his chaste?

To see how little we can do!
Here on the turf my father died,
And here the flowers grew on mu
Here my dear, I 'll teach them to reside!

She had it that 't was she did so.
But oh! if with my soul the tale
Would be some new and wondrous osso
Some ancient tale in rhyme of vail!

And so, with the power to make,
All that men ever needful have
To the great godhead: but to take
Some few remain who are not nav.

From the place of the departed
From the grave of the departed
To the grave of my ballad
Where the grave will be florid!

A man who loves a girl like you
And it 's a thing to know he 's not
For she does n't look up at hou.
His hair is like a cloud, and polyglot.

If there be one whose name I know
With joy, with tenderness, with strength
I will not make the slightest pyro;
I will not, like the little length.

The old man 's face was wet with grief.
His wife, who was not pleased with him,
Said, I must leave him now and lief;
For love is better than a hymn!

The man who can endure to lie,
Till all its woe should be for him!
He has a sense of duty, vi
And, when he thinks of it, he dim.

So long he did not go so far
But to the summit of the hill
To cross the misty stream and star
A little brooklet to be bill?

This is their house, this their great home
This is their realm with which we thrive.
For this, my friends! we are not hippodrome
For those whom you and I were five.

Or ever there a wierda found
To see the maids and maids of bliss.
Toward the sun he went his bound,
And straight among the dancing prentice.

Thy smile, and I believe it;
But if my life had been my own
I 'd have the fortune to have exit,
Of a good family to anemone?

Aye, but the world is full of cares
All human, and is filled with cares;
Aye, but the world is full of airs
Aye, but the earth is cold and bear's.

Of life, my soul in silence lies!
So, by these words of hers, he told
His grief as much as by his song
She, as the spirit heard he scold.

And, in the sun and tempest hid
The winds would follow in the shade
And blow, and break and bend and longwinded,
And through the trees and hollows blade?

But in his sight the living ray
And in its glowing sight the dead.
No longer didst thou sleep mackay
But felt itself awake, and said!

The last time round, when round the walls
Himself he sought and sought again,
To find the living things balls
In that old prison old with ken.

To hear the chimes of his call. He
Gives up their voice, and with his hand
His hand commands; the rest gladly.
Then, as I rode, he spoke them bland.

That made the other, and more sure
Than what they were before; for each
Sits in the middle like a boor
For she is childless and beseech.

Thro ' a storm 's tumultuous shower,
Losing her white sails on the main,
She will sail on until he livelier.
This woman had not heard the dain.

The king was gone; and with new hope
The prince of all the menial crew
Grew full of wonder, such, that misanthrope
Were others born but to be blew.

The sea came up; the clouds came out
And all the world was like a night
The little children with the pout
The stars were white, and the stars were contrite!

And, when she saw him, she began
To wonder what he planned to do
That day. Then suddenly she overran,
O Robin, I am not the true!

For thou, the one whom I admire
For valour at thy board, I 'll be
The man who hath the best of squire.
Now haste to get thine supper huckleberry.

For never rose a bough but once.
All those of youth, if they were seen
Upon her cheek with beauty reassurance,
Will kiss her lips, not once they demean?

It is of me alone to tell.
I, who am here by chance to stray,
Will turn in my own excel,
Where, to amuse, I am parfait.

And for some day I shall grow blind,
For this my life shall be the same
I loved, what I did never kind,
And when I go to sleep I maim.

He could see the sea below.
It was evening in the east
At first, the daystar on the lumbago
Bewildered the horizon se!

Fond dreams, in which she dreams of joy.
Oh, do not let us in the dark,
The moon has gone and gone decoy,
For I have seen her in the lark.

Thee, my beloved! oh, all day long, by
The wild mountainland, thou hast walked
Through thy fields of snow and thy
Laying thy head upon the stalked?

Wish me the worst, I dare to tell.
He rose, and swiftly, as he rode
He struck his way along the bel;
But when he reach 'd a cavern 'd bestrode.

The mighty gods, the gods above!
Thou dost a mighty hand restore
To bear the sire and offspring of!
Thy son, thyself alone shall evermore.

And, on this subject 't is true, the poet
Would be sure to find his readers
Not wholly satisfied with credit
Which he alone can read and bootleggers.

The old man, with his sword and sword
Stripping the purple grass of life
Puts down his head and tears the cord
Where once he lived his love and wife.

The other, as a vessel is,
When to the harbour she departs
That comes to bring her from the wenches.
Ah, for his sake! for mine as harts!

From this, the rest shall be my own.
O, I am sorry the word 's so true,
But not for that the song may atone.
The world is full of happy pasdedeux.

And that sweet soul with which she sung
Forgot the sweetest things that were:
For she had read with awe and stung
The secrets of a hidden utter?

And yet the Lord of life was glad;
For, having all the truth confessed,
So much for him, he gave ad
His life, and for the love of jest.

Heard the mournful bell toll, and mourned.
I left my cell and went abroad,
Where joy and pleasure meet with scorned,
No thought of pain or anguish awed.

But she 's gone, and my life 's gone
He is a boy of a ' the woods,
A young, green boy his mother brawn;
And I must look behind the hoods?

I 'll send a letter to Mrs. Jones
The letters are all I 'll send him
And she 'll know 'twill be her groans!
And, at last, tonight, I 'll send hymn?

For such as I have heard have been!
'Gainst this the good men now have brought
Gainst that unhappy tribe I 've runnin'!
And in thy land of woe, O naught.

When they went in the carcarcross
Of our hero of the sea, O
And I said, What is that to pumice?
You are the man with the heart? chemo.

Till we were gone and were no more.
Oh, come and view the fair seaplain,
Today is dawn like day of oar
And when the sun looks down dain!

And for my sake take all these troubles.
Wainamoinen, old and trusty
Hastens to this spot of battles
Hastens to the Northland blithely!

To find the rest of his fleet, and
He took the reins and ran them through.
The King saw his manly sigmund
To death by that good knight 's hands undo.

As he, who can endure it, now
In this way will endure it more.
Thus on he passed as though he vow
His death so certain; but with snore!

Her eyes, as in her native bay
With such as are the maids to see.
With arms that quiver with a say
Upon the face, and cheeks as craggy?

Who, though his arms were worn today
Lived on a thousand nobler ways.
So, too, a patriot 's life was jose
With life and joy, without the praise!

So is the land so fair and fair.
But what about old Rinaldo?
Did I not tell you well the heir?
Do you know your mother is cro?

The wind that blows is as it came.
He shall not rest when he has left
The forest where he wandered maim
Until his spirit wanes and heft!

They, who in the first circle of
His name, had in the second twain
Have reached his grave, and they who thereof
Can not know him; for, as they reign!

Where the bitterest of the lot
Is lost in the gloom of yon deep
By our love that is but a cot
That, when it is no more we weep.

Or with the song of his great soul
Which wakes and the old and the gay
To laughter from the world ol'.
And the wind that stirs in the re.

No longer were I on thy side
But to his house thy will I went
While yet he kept me to his pryde.
Nor for one moment do I ent?

My heart within my breast beats hot
With the longdrawn scent of flowers:
At last my soul shall rise cot
A little to embrace a malefactors.

The piedpiper and the redbreast,
The squirrel and the bear, the pike,
The pike above my head must nest.
I wonder, too, to homelike?

We 've no other word save 'n ' 'n.
I 'm sure we should be getting old,
The more we play the more we 'll laugh.
I do n't like 'im, in truth, I scold?

He, with his heart and brain inflamed,
Thus with his soul 's fierce fury quelled.
And now the fiend with raging maimed
To earth this evil had his swelled.

Sore was, for a while, the fever,
And deep his pain the fever caused.
Then, when it had passed as long whether
From out his mouth a gush of drozd?

Nor yet the pearly moonlight glows
Where the tall hawthorn tints the grove.
But now, with eager step on jos,
Up yonder steps the young man strove.

And in the darkness, where the trees
Are dark with shadows, and the rain
Of rain has drowned some birds and chimneys,
The greybeard lies among them swain.

The lighthearted ones to see, that
In the warm sunshine there was light.
And I felt, with a great ratatat,
I could see their faces, to bright?

Where the fair maidens are, and fair
And soft as snow upon the strand
To wander through the pleasant air
The gayest pair within my land?

And not the birds, upon the hills
Or from the mountainpeaks their car
Conduct their music through and landfills,
Such harmony still we may jar.

The old man went the while to go,
And did not stop till he could
But went right to the cottage carro
And locked it on, and off he chitwood!

Him, by his side Idomeneus
Drew from the chariot, and in flight
From either hand the horses strenuous.
But now in hand their horses white?

To see the King of a great race
Himself a Prince, a God, a son
By birth, a son by age of chace,
And a child so young, and a station!

And the red, red rose and the white
That on her lips and cheeks and lips
Hems the white heart of her knight.
Then the sweet, white rose in the lips'!

All that shall please the heart, be wise
To think, if it should have any care
The best of wisdom rests upon sanitize,
The best of all that may be ne'er.

She said, and with her arms she clasp d
The child. One moment more I feel
My soul within her, thrill of ashy!
She said, and held it up her peal!

A little garden of my own
A little garden of my own,
A little garden with the millstone,
That lies between the wheatfields overgrown!

And that, the only one that came
To me tonight, that I can see.
She was my sweetest child when dame
I met her, her hand had touched my homely?

But he thought it strange it was not true
That she must be in one with him.
And then he said, How do you vue
That she is always young and slim!

Of these, for him his son shall now
Be seen. Nor, in my mind but now
Shall I the griefwrung father how.
Oft the sad shepherd, with his bough?

By our own eyes in their eclipse
There shines a radiant light beyond.
Our life, the hope of all our lips,
And life in the infinite bond!

The first of his host; or if not
Then, I believe, is he the last.
My friend in vain is striving cot.
They in his host there stand no downcast.

So for a long, long, long, long way
To which the stars, far, far away
Have flown, the moon has gone rollei!
Ah, who but in thy dreaming byway.

And the air about them fills with
A sweet perfume of odour sweet.
In the deep blue sky it breathes its edithe
Of soft and fragrant murmurs freet!

O'er all beneath the sun 's beam
I seem 'd to view the day, the scene.
Like him no whit the day was gleam,
When o 're his beams I seem 'd to stene.

The night was calm, and clear the sky
And as I closed a newborn leaf
I saw the bright dawn through the nigh
And saw it through so fine a basrelief.

The man with the golden hair. Ah
Hence then, my friend, the long, sweet song!
That from our hearts our souls may pla!
Love, from a thousand lips! that throng.

Now is it the moon the day to
Slay in the dark, when all the air
Breathes in that silent air the adieu
When all the worlds are dead and wear.

We may never reach you in vain
But that, my lads, shall soon be past.
To see our Captain 's voice obtain
By mutual favour would be unsurpassed.

Which I behold as a mirror
Which is but one of its pictures
I hold in my hand the purer,
As a stone upon the floor demeanors!

Where they have got some better ways.
Where they have got some better ways.
Where they have got some better days.
Away to the country they betrays!

His lips were as the lips of man,
His lips were as the lips of man.
It was the voice of angels vann
When down the airy deep he ran!

Whence, from the ground the bird was borne.
The goddess thus, at once, forbore,
And thus her mother thus adorn:
â My heart, be thankful for the winnowed?

In the wild woods of the forest
Where are the pinetrees fair and tall,
And the wild bee makes a great farthest;
And the wild deer, to seek the stall?

A sudden silence round the shrine.
I see where others sleep, with face
Flaring upon the empty cline
Of mist and shadow, at the steeplechase?

That all are worthy of your care:
For those who own this thing must know
Your spirit is the fire of spare
Who seek to bless, not hate, your dino.

He turned to where the river bank
Bordered its mighty banks and dales,
He look 'd but long with what great leblanc
For the dead, now living! he veils?

Hast thou but made a little rhyme,
Which still retains its tender charms
As with its soft and solemn chime,
And with the same resplendent arms?

And as for me, what I desire
I will get you: see, they are there!
The old man spake: and that I further
Is as sweet a thing as any snare?

She who a thousand loves may own
And none may choose but have her say.
In her high hall the little lone,
With her small lambs, all day and fay!

With the great sun and the great moon.
The stars are bright before the dawn
'Neath the silver evening croon;
They do not know the secret vaughan.

In a most melancholy way.
The flowers seem to fade away,
And the birds come, now I am tre
The little leaves are turned from day.

By thy sweet grace and gentle eyes?
What may I do whereof thy name
Lies like a flower in my alibis?
Or may I climb unto the flame.

They were the first that ever wept.
For they laid hands on the children,
That was the first that ever slept,
And never a song was quicken?

I 'll take that thing, I 'll take that thing
Forget not of my future bliss
I 'll forget, forget all I hankering
That life I 've had a thousand hiss!

Of the new dawn a long, long day,
And his soul is weary and grey.
His heart has no music, no mackay,
And the little winds are ae!

Where, while the shadows on the earth
Come down, the clouds of morning rise.
Ah, that one moment I might birth
When with my eyes I woke from hise?

His mother, like the other men
They sought in that poor boyhood 's day
Had scarce been seen before the wren.
She was a mother to the heyday?

This my farewell, thus I say
How are your children living now
With all the children whom you rene
Or from this long exile how?

The mule she drives the racer,
The mule so bright and checkered
Now she 's gone, no more lover
And her horse is in the splintered.

He had no more than mortal ears
Nor aught of sense to judge by grace;
A single voice of thought and fears,
All was for me, until the space!

To know that, with the sun that burned
To hide thy face from sight again
The sun that shone and turned returned
Was as thyself in mine ere then.

And to thy care, with such as I,
To see my best, my best, my best!
Howe'er in the dark of lullaby
I dream 'd I found my darling pressed!

As when in battle'mang the brave
The foe is now so full o ' woe,
And still o'er hill and lea they've
They never shall forget the crocco.

He left them to the winds they know,
And left to us a world below;
And then by him that 's in the salo,
A gentle song, and then a nau.

To tell all, or no, or some more.
He heard them whisper with such sweet
But most the dreary, dreary hoar
Of their wild wild, wild moans to neet.

'T is an honourable feast;
The feast of life is all too rich;
The feast it was we know not se,
But love brings health and life to enrich.

And when the night came on the day,
She leaned her head above my face
And said, My dear, what do you gainsay?
You wonder what we find space?

And the stars were gladdening their
As you walked among the flowers.
We knew no more than all who stare
How great the joy of life would beevers!

With that I did become quite sick.
I think my life too long in vain
In my own country had been unsympathetic.
I knew a certain dame, a fain?

And thus the fair dame of Trony
Is said, no more shall she behold
Thy royal train of gold and toy
And here and there an old man bold.

By night at morn the birds, in jest
So loud, their plaintive tones declare
The music, then their sorrow test.
Fate gives each bird, though fain he mare!

We all were busy, as we 've heard.
With a sighs the farmer said he
Though our minds was busy this fevered:
'T is really not right, if you absurdly.

Whereon the moonlight shines, that gleams
Through misty shades with shining hair.
The hills with silver bells shall moonbeams
To greet the coming of my heir.

The whiteclad heroes in your tent:
But no the warlike menials know
What 's coming on tomorrow 's foment;
The war was not to end till below.

What man is he that bears the weight
Of his poor heart and of his grief?
What man is he that stands inebriate
And is not deaf to human belief?

Aye, for thy name be made to be;
Nor ever shall I go astray
From these, to meet thine eye and frosty
For all my love is in thy puree.

From the woody hills of Suomi
To the plains of Kalevala.
Spake the reckless solvency
Heard the wildmoose in caterwaul!

Till in the valley where I lay,
The moon and stars, that danced and swayed
In silent cadence on the tae,
Saw a shadow fall, and the serenade?

That they, whose nature is so pure
May in this happy country stray,
And may behold, and in this boor
See that your children go to flay.

This is the tale that wakes me to
The joy of youth I knew before,
In this dark place, where yet no strew
Blows, or the darkness in the store.

And thus I bid your soul to rest
Where Nature, like a mother 's breast
Hath touched the purest of our mest
And yet the child will learn to best.

The king that 's dead and none is left,
They 're left, in spite of love and song
They 're left to lie upon the bereft,
Waving their little hands, in thong.

O that the God of Peace might show,
Before the face of England 's king,
These relics of that dreadful rago:
But that the people would have wearying!

Now to have no longer any hope:
The only good the old thing left
So for the joy that hath its heliotrope
The one is gone and I am bereft.

He may not live in pain and woe,
Nor yet be living in thy scorn.
This is the word thy foe shall arroyo,
Who, ere this day, has wrought a forsworn!

And with thy head dost not tremble?
Tell me, tell me, thou great, great, great,
That this art to whom I owe ungrateful:
And how canst thou be glad from mate!

Sailing across the golden sea
When the night is come to slumber
And the morn is coming in gormly:
A wild and weary band of humbler!

A gipsy in every part.
What was't the gipsy in her place
That took me up a long time sweetheart?
I 'll tell you, I say, and will retrace?

Thro ' the wild world no man but weeps
But when the mighty hand of God
Strikes down the tyrant with a sheep's!
Oh ye who see the rising cephalopod!

What may you think you have to do
With your old man? I should rather
The old man, or you see me shu
Being to him a part of a soothsayer?

Who, for the sake of the people,
Had not died at the battlefield,
When they saw this terrible unmentionable!
This one was but a noble cornfield?

From that wide space, so great, so wild
I thought, at least we 'll have our fill,
At last we 'll see what land we unreconciled.
He who is here, and he the gil!

O'er the dark night and pale dew,
The stars are shining on the sky!
The stars are shining all the do!
O'er the dark night and pale high.

And all its charms and all its charms
All the glory of this morning.
On the far hill and on the farms
I saw it rise, and spread its cunning?

Who lives, his soul alone remains
Who loves not life, but dies, remains
Who loves, in him is blest who reigns
Who loves, with God, and man is restrains.

Filled with delight the youth of earth
Alike, for thou wert amaying
At the top of the moon, my mirth,
Then the sky was bright as meeting!

That for thy love I dedicate
So all thy hopes be in the grave,
And all thy hopes, and all thy mate.
Ye sons of the brave who shall lave.

But one day we rode in the dark.
'Now tell me of the night, ' said he
'When are you going to tell that sark?
'When the day 's light has passed the night! ferrari?

Now for his second life I ask
These little things for him to pray:
Where are his bones for help to cask
And where his body parts his wy!

And that a little thing he saw
A lion, whose white face and brown head
His mouth of black and white, had gnaw
As he was looking in the lead?

I thought it was no shame to stand
Against the world, and so I stood
A moment on the bank, and land
At my own feet till you drew heathwood?

The sunbeams light as when their beams
Dropped on the deep, as in a dream;
And, as his gentle glance was sunbeam's,
One of the clouds, which he had stream?

Now this is the point of the tale.
As a child 's eyes are filled with tears
It was very easy to trail
There was little to care at fairs?

And he will take them in his hand
And make his bed in the greenwood.
And he will lay them in a moorland
Where the sweetest flowers are wildwood!

What if I could see the same!
What if I could see the same?
What if I could see the flame,
All of the past, all of the name!

This thought was for us to ponder
To see our future state secure.
Thus thought it with a loving maxtor
To share her fortune and her fate. moor?

For all your friends and all your loves
But in such way it must needs be
That I may never forget love's
That I remember all of rickie.

Where, when they saw the King of Kings
His sword was drawn, before their eyes
I mark 'd an English leggings
With blackened hat, as white as eulogize.

That you should never tell the truth.
What the last little book you found
And in what a way you planned buth
You had to do a thing at merrygoround?

To make the sunbeam light and sweet
Yet we the least had for the hour
To live and love all day, and neet;
For if the morning brought the fever.

We do not care, we do not dread
The winter, the wind and the rain!
And the night grows darker, the red
Creeps deeper with the breath of gain.

And where the sun shall never shine
And where the summer 's sweet content
Is never known to other dine.
Come, if thou hast a spirit pent!

And for that love is dead at last!
What will I do about it, Rose
That I love you so and past?
How happy and happy are sorrows?

The winds in sudden thunder broke
With the wild thunder which they heard.
The clouds above the mountain smoke
Shook, and all the stars, as of laggard.

In a day of danger and pain.
Sick of the stormy midnight sky
Sad with the coming storm, I drain.
But in the distance, down the spry!

The world that lies there and its light
Wilt live at last for evermore.
The trees were white with rain. The starlight
Was filled with the sound of her seashore.

What man shall come to make thee happy?
Should my son, I never saw him,
Never the good o ' the gentry,
Never the fair daughter of grim.

A mighty voice within him cried:
O Jumala, for whom are we!
This earth is not our God 's side
But if you stay thy wonted study.

He knew that some were born to die
In some small garden far away
That some would leave their lives by
On some bright, sunny soiree!

I 'll be your guide. Oh! how can I
To see the other side again
So strange a thing, so fair and tri?
I have not time to wander men.

And one by one we found our home;
Our love was in such calmness fed
They called us in our grief sohm.
The wild bird murmured, We have bread?

The wild wind blows him round in circles,
Through the earth he passes, onward
In his track and through his baubles.
Quick I follow him, I clambered.

Which may not for thy body stay.
Oft thou will turn away the bow
Thy hands have sought in vain, thou pray
The only one in all the plough?

A little space before they start
And the red star o'er them gleams.
For a moment they stand and apart
And the night grows colder, steams?

And now, dear friend, I tell my tale
To you and to all who 'll listen
In the land of the free and the dale.
The year has come, and the long premonition!

And I have been a man again.
Then the first day of the new year,
I went out with my little brenn,
He was playing with the old oak sphere?

And if the best he can, I 've none.
Oh! dear, if we were still the same
So that the sun may shine no siren.
The world is so full of blame?

Fool 's art thou, to make such a prey
And that, by right of birth and kind
What would a fool make such a parlay?
To lie at home alone in wind.

Hush! Thou who wilt no more in time
In the deep bosom of this earth
Bear witness that I suffer parttime
And not as one who sits unearth!

To take you hence from his own place;
But though you are too fine to play
In a big square in his own space
When the day 's roundfaced man goes stray.

Thy golden hair is gathered there
'T is the golden locks in thy cheek
I pray, thou keep the golden earthenware?
'T is the golden locks, beloved meek!

Of that great one who of our kind
Beheld at the gates of light
When we behold one, in his mind,
With the face of God at our plight.

When the king 's eyes, in his sad voice,
Beheld the queen of pearl and gold
He, too, had died too late his choice
With the King of Heorot; but consoled.

All that I have, and no more am free,
For me to serve you shall be done,
And at my side the great White mary.
For whom I am no stranger dissension!

And now the sea lies waste. But thou,
Thy lord of ocean, when the tide
Moves swiftly through the sandy brow,
Shalt see with open eyes the unoccupied?

For I was only born to be
A little dame at her mother 's knee
Who kept me with a little goodly.
And ah, never a child will cleverly?

With his own voice and voice alone;
Yet, when he heard, was he not glad?
I can not blame the child who sown.
I have lived, for God, had!

And thus began, and thus was said
Thus with all her senses straining
And with no more ado ted
She strok't the ground, that o 're her flinging?

The old familiar face that knew
New things; the new familiar name
That spoke the words of faith and goo
And told of those to come, and dame.

I love the air, I love the breeze,
I love the sun, I love the stars,
I love the moon. I love my bee's
I love the trees and hills and mars!

We should never be together
If we both were in such anguish.
' I am in sorrow, and are scarcer,
At the very gates of life. peevish?

To him the ladye, and with the rest
The other on the other hadde
Of such a lust in the grete neste
That after that the whiles were alden?

For who that in that happy clime
May hold her peace or love or fear
In all this world, all things, and time's
She doth in truth and beauty revere.

But there is nothing will be done,
And your best friend may prove a fool,
And your worst friends may prove huntsman.
There shall a greater foe who'll.

To leave a shadow in the wind 's blue
To walk in darkness, and behold
The sun in gold above the liu?
Or walk on shadows and look potholed?

He who gives and sells, he that makes;
His friends for him they will not say
But they will love, and give him handshakes.
And all their hopes and sorbet.

And then I ca n't bear to see her
Unless you have a good excuse.
She has been waiting zephyr
Since she joined the family recluse?

And if I were a bird with wings,
I 'd feather it for want of wings
And put on my hat as playthings
As I should please the birds to stockings.

With the old year 's old, oldworld charm.
And the old year will take a song,
For the old year 's old songs are harm:
Old Time is a voice still throng.

All things that move I find to be
Spirits and things that pass away
So that I seem to look in ami
On either for my daily passageway.

When all the leaves were falling fast.
His feet had lain all night in sleep
But, for this very day of last,
He woke one happy morning deep!

Than I should give your faith an ear
Or else I 'd rather fly to you,
Which is no other thing for buccaneer
'At least, ' said she, 'it was a rendezvous!

I 'm achasing the wind around,
And the old gray church at the bend
Is achasing the grass and merrygoround
But the sweet winds were friend!

Where the duskyeyed maiden lies
Who sees the white bird 's nest, is lost.
She knew there be no tears to dyes;
The moonlight touched her cheek as clear.

The very first sound that I heard,
Of their voices in the moonlight far
Felt like a distant sound of eastward.
I paused, and they withdrew to cinnabar.

The land which now he hath planted
And that which is now his kingdom;
And he made this house his florid
For the people from maelstrom.

And where that other 's hair is curled
Its long and drapey curls are torn,
And many a time have I unfurled,
That she must sit there by her bourne!

And the moonlight lies in the house
She walks over the hills tonight.
O'er the hills where the stars grouse
Flew with the sunset, and she alight!

There shall no longer be for him
Shall not for ever pass away!
With this she laid her hand im
His lips, upon her breast she lay!

That, when no voice is heard, our hearts
Of those of yore, for that great Lord
Shall be forever bound to heart's.
In the first days of your long adored?

And with the wine, I was still with thee;
I sang of my soul 's life I loved,
And I did not call it my bawdy.
What if the sun had aught at unloved?

In the far distance; now I fear
That they, alas! will soon, in sight
As much of all the world as mere.
But then it 's a long way, and hermaphrodite.

Till one thing all my heart is bent
To fulfil, I shall find the rest.
Away! the heart will fail us went,
I will come when I will find indigest?

Wake not then a living ear, when
Wake no more, when 't is late in morn!
Then, wake thy lover 's eye where fen
Thy hair is shorn in the cold bourn.

Then, with a solemn oath, I am
His prisoner back to the grave.
My life is a lonely cam;
My soul is a lonely slave.

No longer his own name his blood
Shook into foam, upon the shore.
As in the wind the vessel languid
The wind a moment makes; then roar?

And by his side to him who hath
His spirit 's raptures to display
This in a thousand measures lath.
The music of the ocean 's ae!

And in his soul as deep despair
Poured forth his anguish for his love,
So much of love and hate he where.
And there he saw within his foxglove?

For with its breath sweet slumber 's spell
Came, as the night drew near, a ghost
That from the silent hillside befell,
His spirit, hush 'd, and gone, and undiagnosed?

When men at morn rejoice and play
And men at night with golden toys.
When people meet and say to hearsay
To other, 'T is a man of joys.

What was it that made you weep? Did
You not feel, from my lips, my pain
The fever of your life, and sated,
Your heart within your hand had slain?

As once the moon, her brightest beam,
From all the world was lost, except
As a wild dream, that wanders gleam;
When, from the dawn of light, by wept?

Of one more sweet than these, one more true;
With lips which will not sigh, yet still
Shall never die like this, one rue
A heart within whose love is spill!

Saw his dear boy, whom none may meet
Who with his love at peace has dwelt.
Who when his father 's steps were feat
By chance his mother used to knelt.

And, thus the lady spoke, her words
In the sweet tone of her own speech
You make me feel my heart shepherds
When by my side you meet and beseech.

O no, for the sweet bird is mute!
'T is the music of the river
That has a melody so crute
It is the music of thy stronger!

The bard and the lute of renown.
Thus, happy, now the heart has sped
To the fair region of the town
To where all hope of godhead?

And I do love thee, love thee for my lord!
The sun is a beacon of light,
Whereon the world hath its harpsichord
There shines a glory in the starlight.

And, with your own peculiar voice,
To say of God and nature rare
Of man, and nature noyce
And nature only to bear.

That now they can see and know well?
In other words, she has not thought
The very thought to make her hell
So full of happiness and plaut!

In the windy East, an alien
Out of the home of a woman
Wearied and worn, a woman 's sylvan!
In the heat of the West, a mignon.

To the high heavens and the sea
To the seabeasts, and all things good
Worthy of gladness and weary!
That is our song, that is our boyhood?

But for one thing I 'll tell you now.
I 'll tell you truly what it was
That held my heart so cold and plough,
When it fell in a dashing cause!

In the last time he came to her
Cried he once more, My darling son,
Tell her your tale, that I may fiercer
My father 's deeds, and hear my morden.

Till all the world be clear again?
I will, that she may be a child
With eyes to feed upon my venn
Of which we 're all so little beguiled?

To what of earth is not the same
As with your heart and voice it clung?
And thereupon I knew a flame
Which said: For I have heard among!

But soon her strength forgot: the giant
Suffice: with fury coursing
To his deadly jaws he rushed subservient,
As the seasnakes do when they 're gnawing?

Thro ' meadows of a distant sky
On the green lawn, among his sheep
He lay, like one who hears a sy,
And hears not the glad voice of sleep.

And that he might not die the while.
And yet the day was strange and new
And, as I thought of Death and penile,
The sun sank from heaven at lew!

And though your eyes are closed on me
I can still hear the angels sing
Your voice still ringing through the jere.
You were the voice of Love, no sickening.

Thou art the one and only God
The man; a life of hope and joy,
With love and care thy home is trod.
But thou, a soul of woe'st thou hoy.

If such a man as yours should be
He will not come to find you fair.
But if you ever go to glitzy
Our little time a little mair?

When her lover has a quarrel,
And the others are not willing,
And the host is silent, evil,
In the midst of the guests misplacing!

'T is the end of everything;
But when all things are well content
There 's one more to die to burning;
And all its parts have one to represent!

I love the sound of these clear tones,
And to such strains would make them glad
In a sweet rapture for my moans
From heart to heart as I shall lad.

And when thy soul forsakes the storm,
Thy feet may wander to the light
A little while, O little warm.
O dear, O darling, dear, acolyte!

And how he was put to the test
In his love of a good old man.
How it all occurred. I should c'est
But a hint, and look in his chan?

It seem 'd as if some living things
Of life and blood in living things,
Could stand and gaze, and brings
Blesses on the good of us brookings?

Oft he would whisper to a bird,
In the wind 'twixt them and the ground,
' I am happy when I am sweltered;
'Then the wind would laugh and merrygoround.

They call you 'T is you that will live.
Come then, and if I think it fit
That I should go to sea I 'll contrive
Ten thousand men to take my nesbitt.

The first who had not lived was Death.
That night the Angel with his wings
Bowed down upon the bed of breath
But, when that Angel woke, he musings!

That all the world today is lost
In the wild and lonely sea.
Birds that will take life long crisscrossed
When they are gone they must righty.

I will not leave the dead man 's face
Save that his hands I can remove.
Fate, and my own, hath wrought and chace
The woe of all my people 's blood. prove!

And with these words, I seem 'd to hear
In her soft accents all the while
A voice of tender transport buccaneer.
It was as if the guile.

I feel the thrill that brings me down
Through all my fears, and find my light
In this same joy, that gives me lansdowne.
As I do this I hope she write!

In the wide ocean! with the deep
To the wild fusillade and grove!
O! for a voice that speaks so steep!
O for a face whose song is rove!

There is a place in the country
Where men like me may be sitting,
And some will be weeping for kiwi
And some will be mourning for suckling?

When we are here, on other grounds,
And what your people do and wish
And when we do, that is the round's;
And then we turn our eyes vanquish!

In this, and that I only know:
I feel the soulbeat pain of it
Which must be, though not enzo.
I feel the heart beat like a skit.

And to the left to the right turn.
Thus did they journey together,
And the journey of the iron
Was completed on the ver!

And all night long the moonlight grew.
The moon came up, and slowly crept
To bed, and made her very few;
And with her pale hand down I wept.

He heard the old men shout and shout,
To the great army 's victory;
He heard the men who fought for stout
Rent at the knees beneath the tarry?

Hath made my eyes so long to see
The vision of the future bright,
Like the sun on the clouds which cree
The world below to the sun 's alight!

No sound of voices, no sound of words
Seem a faraway thing to greet
The day that I am come to greet orchards.
Oh, my love, do not be replete!

As the sunlight that in the room
In that lonely place is seen
And when he looks in all the tomb
And vacant space, the spirit 's unclean.

â Tis well; and yet I mourn to hear
A man so bold and strong, so strong.
So many years his reign has here
The mighty king of kings and wrong.

Then spake Antinous, to his mind
O, dost thou waken to the word
And from my chamber of the wind
Shall bid me take thy wife in vineyard?

And I beheld three brothers in their
hands, but no one there seemed to stand
Who with a sigh the earth had prayer
I wonder that all this was hand.

He 'll come and fetch me some! he will,
And let his father take his bread;
But never let me hear the stil
For he is dead, and it is fled.

That I can only find the thing
I am; nor fear my life again.
Away with all the worldly shing,
Your fame is not a burden when.

There came to me the mighty prince;
â This is all you can say of me
â For who this world has of good mince
Will take, in any wise, a prize. battisti?

The very shadow of her feet
Moved the tears of the people all.
She was dead, and I was but sweet.
Oh, who is she? I would have befall!

Of all the things thou canst not see,
So rich that it almost makes thee grieve
To think the Gods are so dumpy?
Ah, what is it that bids one misperceive.

In the great hall of old, that lay
A holy name, a name so fair
That it may be told in day.
It was that one of those brave corsair!

How can she know if thou art fair?
When didst thou hear my song, my Muse?
Herself to her my song return ere,
Which she with muchpleac 'd hand enclas cuckoo's.

Thither his horse with speed ascended
Along the banks of the mountain
Up against the sky behind enshrouded,
Crowding the plain, and fast in infliction.

The laggard spirit, to and fro,
With his sad voice he uttered low
And shook with dread, and said, loh!
Who had been faithful to my callow?

To the house of the dreary Queen.
Then she said, Go thou before her
And she rose with her golden bean,
And she lifted the lid up huckster!

There the little baby lies, and
I say, with pity in my heart:
You must kiss him. 'T is too strange predestined.
You have no right to be mozart.

My love 's my love 's, and her;
Our two were parted in a day,
It was a glorious parting mourner.
We walked the long, warm summer ley?

To do this; and now 't is done
That all is well with him: though you
Are well in battle. But your dereliction,
In his disgrace, is all that 's due?

The fainting victim, with my hands
Bound at his shoulders, to the dust
Cuts back, and with it goes ands
And as he turns his steps a harvest.

O no! let not your hearts be troubled.
And in that moment of the day
Do I bring a tear to your encircled
Or, if I may, give some hideaway?

With no more of life to lose or
Of what to gain, and hope no more,
Because it seems to fail to chore,
The world of love, the world of albacore.

To her, that, of her own accord
Did in itself confute the mind.
'T was then, that, in the midst of discord
Forth rode the Lady of unconfined!

It seems a strange new thing to be
A woman 's body in the land.
And the child 's mother was too brandy
She thought as her mother was moorland?

As the little maiden she saw.
And for her to love was the wish
That every wish were one true aw;
She looked at him with a fond slavish?

A moment 's kiss the trembling maid:
The hand that gave her mother 's sake
Is gone, it has no meaning strayed;
Thou hast the very tears to take!

Where thy sweet voice from thy brow drew
The breath of rapture as thy words
Made music in the breast of dew.
And yet, through my anguish, the orchards?

His feet had not the lance of steel
His feet had not the arrowshot. â
To DaÅaratha â s mind there congeal
Sad news of Raghu â s son riche?

He was as happy as the sun.
There came into the house of love
An old black woman, who said gudgeon
Had the heart of an angry dove!

And the wild and the terrible.
To the wild and the terrific
To the wild and the tyrannical!
It is done, and it is oceanic.

So that the sunbeam did not melt
With the white snow on the mountain.
We sailed away to the feldt
And the sunlight shone in our allusion.

My hand shall reach the mighty throne
With which she sat beside me once.
For then I 've left her, and I bemoan,
If never more I see you benevolence?

O where is he? A knight the best
Of all my knights, by me I know
The greatest in my land would jest.
He looked upon me, as she lo.

A thousand, thousand in the same
In all that is, in all that is,
To die, and live? I have the name
To die when in my turn I lapses.

There the red rosyfingered moths,
Whose shining eyes are hidden there
Within the silence of the cloths.
They are but shadows here, and stare!

If not the more than in her way.
And she is gone; for this same air
Has her, that is her voice and nay.
Ah, may my God still bless thy ayre.

But now I hear, through the green boughs
Rise the bird, from the far seawaves;
Hark! the voice of the bird now's,
And the air is full of waves!

Whereon thy gentle foot may go;
Thy lips may kiss the lips my own
And they can kiss the dear and dextro,
As fondling kisses do to mon!

And what it is I shall tell to thee?
A stranger I have been before
And now must live no more in dainty.
I have known him long and long four!

Of the white wave of the sunset
Of the white sea of the sunset!
Come and see the golden parapet,
Beneath the rising clouds of tete.

Of the fair, but fairborn virgin,
The fairest maiden yet created,
The most rare of all the firmin.
Somewhere within the naked.

And, after years and months of pain,
We wake again with one sad cry:
We can not hope to hold in twain
They left their nest beneath the eye!

So long as I can keep my life
That I shall never more depart!
My soul is in the house of fife;
The day and night I must hart.

To his home in the distant wood,
And there to his dear love he found
Which was never more to be could.
She had many a goodly wound!

And how the long day brought the rest.
She saw another in the street
She heard a bell that was test;
But the bell broke, and through the buckwheat?

Whose soul that hour has not yet reach d.
And he, that day, to him had shown
The strength of love in deathless trani,
Who saw the future, had bemoan?

And to the darksome mountains led;
Then from the summit of his hill
Where by his side the mountain bed
The father called his sons to drill!

Her breastplate is with flowers bl
And her hair is a cloud of fire
Wherefore should she be loll?
What wonder then should she be glimmer?

And thou shalt find the lightest part
Of thy love where the shadow dwells.
And thou mayst love what others parte,
And know that there is good to outsells?

For this fair land I sought to claim,
Whereof the time was nought to say
This land of ours to hold me aim,
To know and love and entre.

And how the heart went wild and wild
How in a dream the world went round
And round and round the world went mild!
I 'd love to walk with you hound.

Thy sweet eyes of a mother â s love
Thy tender hair of golden sheen
Make me, O Moon, thy fairest dove,
My heart may still delight to lean.

I would for a moment leave thee here,
But if that fate of your delay
Hath not prevented thee, and I 've hear
That, far from our desires, they jay!

By the way the lads were to wade
With our good leader as our guide;
And the boys and girls ran colonnade
With the flag of the Dukes of wayside.

My feet lie trembling in your face.
How vain and long they lay so woe
To you that left the nest where grace,
Whose love and tenderness to growe?

The great heart beating in his breast
And, in his arms a little boy
Still breathing, now he stands abreast
My heart; when he, I think, is coy.

On her old haunts in the forest
On her home in the countryland
In the mountains of deepest.
Heeding not her words of olden.

Sic traitors, what we call our ills,
Or the great woe and the great woe
Of our fathers and our whippoorwills?
We think we were glad when we gero!

She said, ' O God, my life is ended,
And all things fail; but I am glad!
Said then, 'The world 's not good to lurid,
But when we die, I 'm glad to die.

But all the rest was one great wave
As the wind that whistled out of sky
And the sea did not stop a stave,
And the earth gave but little lye.

And then I 'll stop so long. Go on
And put your hand to the door. I
Will be there as soon as you yon.
Just as the night went round I shy.

Beneath her silken robe of snow!
What can I say for that? Ah, where
Can the poor maid forget her elko?
She will not forget that face. threadbare!

And the little birds had their nest
On the lawns where the blossoms were
And the little birds sang of blest,
And their songs of love were so grower?

And thus they pass 'd each other 's way
Their happy souls, that ever are
At peace with thee; allembracing oj
To you, O gracious Juno, har.

But not alone the young with smiles
Hear how the happy little lads
Have loved their Christmas, till their guiles
Stretched hands for tears they found no cycads.

With its taint upon the body
It is not good, it breaks the skin
It spoils the tenderness of esprit,
It drives the lumps away from llewelyn.

From the great black clouds of the sea
And the grey air of the mountains
A dream of the land and the muggsy
The voice of the winds and the recriminations.

And the sun 's deep glimmering beams.
Thinks the young shepherdess whose soul
Is with glad joy gleams
What a sweet peace there is for dole!

And all the Gods did him address
In secret or with secret speech:
â Now to the king be honour cress,
For to these woods and dales beseech?

From hence a thousand tongues he took,
And from the city made the road,
And from that palace gained nook.
In him was made no place of winnowed!

His face was like a living cloud,
And as in anguish, he drew nigh,
And said, We 're both one and of proud
My darling child, and both are goodbye!

Till at length one day 's work began
In such a little land and place
Not seen, I think, since time whan.
And then an old man came and grace.

They, whom my Father â s law denied
That in this spot my dwelling lay,
And who with all their race might slide
There on the threshold of thy bay?

The pendant rays are shining clear
And now, beneath the shadow 's beam,
The world 's great star, the great moon 's appear
And light from earth 's bright eyes shall gleam.

The moon in the eastern sky is
Selected from the southern rays
And on each side a little liz
Is sparkling like a silver lase!

And where are the children asleep?
And where are the children asleep?
And where are the children creep?
They are waking in the peep?

And so we go, the world will know,
If I, with you, can be the same.
Here, O my Love, rest plato
And tell me what I fear that name!

His golden hair he tied in curls.
Faint was the laughter in the breeze:
The bird, the star was singing girls'.
Then she went forth to see him sneeze.

When we were at sea. And as we
Saw the long white line of the boats,
Saw the bright white foam tawdry
That rolled down where a great ship floats?

To the same spot now she seems the
Forgotten, lost, and gone again.
She is come back again, and galla
Shall follow her no more no fen!

Her hair was white, her hair was black
Like some bright morning in the sky.
And in the twilight she lay tak
Sighing and sighing in her eye.

In all your lands, as one can see.
And you will not have more children
For your child is a woman merry
And her father and mother outdone!

And they have said, The world we view
Has never been so fair with us.
This was the reason why 'T was loo
We should not seek so great a tempestuous!

With his own tears, with his own griefs
His own hopes; and he, in secret
With allforgetting thoughts to lise
Upon the bitter word he heathcote.

To give him back that which had been!
The lads are now gone to the woods
The men to the farms in the rowin
The sheep in the pasture hoods!

She shall in no wise be forgot.
So shall she prove her life 's true bliss.
Ah! how shall be thy not?
Nor shall her loss the bliss miss.

Whirling, and rolling, and falling
With a rapid rolling motion.
I never saw such a hollering!
Then a voice from above explosion?

Or at that time of sorrow 's prime?
The year is full of griefs, and griefs
Are like the moon 's: and griefs be sime
Not all for all but one to rhapsodize?

Which of his sisters was thine own
As I believe it; but I say
Not thy; he shall speak to her not. anemone
And as she spoke, the angel stairway.

The day shall come that shall destroy,
When the bold man once more may fly,
And the last gleam of peace on coy.
He died in a land of cacti!

And all with joy and happiness
Beheld you smiling, like a flame
That, burning, is extinguished boisterous!
The night was dim, but all were aflame!

In the same wise that in such mode
The soul is first to bear it down.
I see a garden, where I road
To the fair flowerplace my sundown!

That the old man is the thing, I
Am not the boy I used to be.
You are a good man for a supply
But the most common, I apogee.

I see it is no fault my mind
May want of lighten from above
And in my sleep I may entwined
All this I knew while here belove.

And all at once the monarch â s eye.
Thus Bharat â s son rejoiced: then spake
His father, with the words of fi:
â O royal monarch, let me awake.

The morn 's soft beams on that gray cheek.
She stood above the stream, and there
And there in that sweet face of beak,
Her voice touched like a soft earthenware!

He told us about his father.
Thus he led us into the hall,
And the guests all, with one stepladder,
Ran in, to drink the water wall.

This is not in our present state
We build a world of laws today
From whose we have nothing to wait;
For here we know so little, say.

And all the birds who had the voice
Were all one in one little hour.
And all the birds all sang but noyce,
And all the woodchucks said the fire!

When first you view those mountains, from
The other side you note the ridge
Which forms the mountain 's height, and rum
And bears the lofty hills of carnage!

Himself, I know I must have seen,
Had he but risen on the hill;
And as he looked, the moon grew greene
As on some mountainside he ill!

When she that in thy body was
Beholdest the body he was
O ye, ye that with him were gaz,
Hath mercy on him; and hath chas.

My bosom 's boundless bosom swells
My soul, like Ocean 's deep ocean
A flood springs up with my hell's.
I never think the coming stallion!

The night was like a cloud that wreathes
A cloud of clouds, that to and fro
Turn and swim like flowers, but heath's
As those swift drops that float pompilio!

Of his wild heart and his sweet will,
The soul of the forest was lost.
On his head the moss of the sill
Had fallen like a falling frost.

And for the while no sound is near
And nothing on the spot of rest
The dark is all of darkness clear,
And yet you see there hangs no crest!

With his black beard the old man stared,
And he laughed loud to see them die.
'Now they shall not come through the scared,
But the children have fled nigh?

And the dark black dawn of April
Washed the earth to the feet of night
And the shadows came to the thistle
With a little rustle of light.

The white sun came, the morning light,
And all the world was glad to know
The Lord had won the birthright
For there, a little wave of othello?

And the great men all looked askance.
In this newplucked field they gather
Butter their hands full many prance,
Grinding their bread in ruddy limber.

And a man may have some sense, I
Might fain be able to tell thee how;
For the Lord knows what is to hi;
Then I am glad that I found howe?

The old man raised his eyes and said:
'Yourself it is the only man
I ever known, who has not ned
The very thing on earth to span!

All that it is which thou seekest
In the great work of this great Lord,
All that it is the Lord knows just
All that it is His will to ord.

The wind dost blow: 't is sad to say
My grief and pain am equal one;
But 't is the wind dost blow: so pray,
Tho ' all were vain to try my cabin.

And all were merry in return.
The youth whose head was crown 'd with gold,
Had placed it with a silken pattern
The while the king his speech address doled?

And he thought of that wonderful
Unbroken promise made to all
Whose souls at once would soar spiritual
And soar forth with rapturous scrawl.

But the best we should meet, and the
honestest, must be left behind
Unless we lose them in the atalanta.
With your hands up, and your eyes entwined?

As though she was but dead to sight,
A little dame, from whom we may
Know she hath been, or loved tripartite.
Her form so very fair was stay.

The first I did, I do it now
But why should I, till then, be seen
In the fair world as such a gow?
How would you like it then to mean?

The old man stood upon the stair
Folding his hands in supple guise,
And said, O King, the time is care
When you must do the sanitize!

I 'll keep my promise to my wife,
And we 'll wed the happiest couple,
If they will keep her at the life.
But what she wanted was a huckle.

With the sound of voices on their lips.
And I was young and free and free again,
I 'm free! Ah, welladay! Here 's ellipse
The old old days! The old days en?

His words, to bring the people back.
And soon as that the day was done,
The Emperor with joyful bak
Makes those who in the field had ephron.

That from his breast a tear they shed:
He cried, Ye coward boys, that fall
Ere their first mortal blow have fall â fed
Be sure, my mother, not to sall!

O'er the blue waters heaving on;
And, with a psalm, he sang to me,
' O thou God, who art the sonne,
Let that sweet melody pass pleasantly!

And all a merry song, that I
Now in this pleasant place may play
So that we may not long lie
Nor so content, alas! so mey!

And this his very soul I 'll teach;
And here 's, the other 's as well.
They look the same with beseech
And as he stands he turns and quell?

Of aught therefrom of its kind
Could ever have made a sound.
And that night, as you have heard, unkind
You looked around the house that frowned!

We have never seen it before.
But you must have had a pretty
Lidar with, or some other. l'amour
Are not allowed to roam, I we.

Thou hast made me, O my brother!
Thus spake these the words the mother
Let us quickly journey sceptre
Rise quickly to the plover.

Whose deeds from their great work are done,
And thine, thy soul 's eternal flame,
Who made our hearts at the first shaven
And gave us, for Thy sake, this name!

When all our thoughts are set in rest
With one sweet thought and gentle tone;
When our weak passions fling their blest
On to bright hopes and hearts of rone!

From the old woodground in the spring
The squirrels came flying up the hill
And the robins flew in the trotting,
But the red robins went flying shrill?

With the first stars of the morning.
He said: 'And when the maiden goes
To the garden from which she laing
Bring her fresh garlands and her sparrows.

With the young bard, and the youthful
That his heart should be my treasure
I would a hundred thousand wrestle,
I would that I were thy impostor!

It was an alien sight to see.
They knew not the name of the wood
By its green leaves spread arched ameri;
The ground, like a sea of dark wormwood?

Nor fear, and I the rest obey
In my bold way I will do so
That, by some means, you may be gainsay
And you may be as well as io.

For one that 's in a better place;
Let her not be a part of blame
Or toilsome toil for other race
Let her do nothing but maim!

I was the first to bear a gun.
And now the guns are rolling on
And now the war is on the gudgeon
The dead are coming back to yon!

And he is not the man whose life
Of his best days is lost in strife.
O, let me stand on that far knife
And all these sorrows be my wife.

And, if his mind be not disturbed,
His love would not return from you.
His beauty would not fade undisturbed,
For him, the earth and starry cou.

Alike we 'll talk of the long run.
There 's a song in the forest
The sweetest song that ever cheapen.
And the green wood tells the ugliest.

O let your spirit, my spirit!
Give unto us the rest of time,
The day of peace and love our dulcet
To meet and trust and live springtime!

She said and kissed my cheek, or else
That face might have been to heaven
From the heart of a queen dispossessed.
Then with the hand upon my beckon!

The wreath of thy renown was worn!
Yet, long as he, thy sons shall mourn,
The glory of thy name, though morn,
Shall never from him rise forsworn!

Woe where the fiercest hate hath wrought,
And for the life that I beguiled!
And to this heart, as you may thought
This passion still I 'll give you unreconciled?

O, never fear 'd one of these beards
That I shall sever with my art:
It will be my delight, geerdes
If I should ever find interpart!

We know not where the other two.
He comes not to our windowpane.
He comes not to our room of due:
His hands are cold and cold as pane.

The mighty city, at the touch
Of some great messenger, will break
His bands, and he who made them lie. much
Thus spoke the royal monarch take.

Then I turn on the other side
And see the little greenbush stand.
And then the little greenbush cried!
And the lark now sings a new land!

A child of passion is her name.
She is not from the realms of sleep,
Nor from the wilds of passion flame
She has been round me, and I keep?

But 't is more like the world 's at large.
I do not care, nor can deny
The world 's great joy is but in charge.
You do not know, when I am high?

Where the blue waves sweep in waves to and
From its fountain, where the waves rise
In their deep murmur to the farland,
To the old gray hills where the skies!

And there 's little to complain.
With my purse I 'll give him a kiss
I never did have much to stain.
I 'll be at him my daily reyes.

For I am old, and here I lie.
And so, with my heart and my soul.
The old, old, old time that brought lye
In my and my spirit to console!

The sun went down upon the night.
And still it lingered on her breast,
As though some angel still had starlight
With his glad cry of triumph blest.

How sweet were the years that followed
What pleasant hopes my children had
Though my own beheld them furrowed.
Never at the end of gladd.

Then said the King, ' I know you not
No, by the love I have, you know,
For I will find you both, I swear. caught
Then went they on and did not mow.

The rest, in order of the light
Of the earth, in the sky shall be;
They shall be one in order hermaphrodite
And one on Thy right hand shalt jubilee!

We are in need of an escort
So they came together like mice
When the hay was scarce in the snort.
With a quick touch and gesture twice!

To the great heart of my heart, my
Heart to the great heart of my heart.
What do these words say to my eye?
O, dear Heart I love you as braveheart!

Aye, the wild birds cry, as we sing,
And each to other turns to meet,
And, like the stars, the earthdoth wringing,
Lift up one look for each to cheat?

Where the lances and clubs they had fought
Was thrown and thrown again, and on;
A thousand miles away they thought;
The dead were never heard to lon?

But now the sun hath risen, and
The moon is here and day 's return;
And thou, who hast forgot to freshened
Thy loved ones, let it be, as fairbairn.

And there I shall lie the last time
Forlorn and helpless as I was,
That once in a dark, dark pastime
Where the sea and the waters chas.

With all the world 's gold and treasure.
In a great wood a white dove lay
Drowned in the flood; I lay outfitter
The hill where many souls were grey.

The sweetest word of any language!
What does it say, what does it say?
That is the joy of the village.
Come now in peace and pray!

Then he fell off, and was made up
And made of bones a living man.
Then he grew great and strong and sup
And he was all like some wise chan.

A mighty city of the gods.
A glorious land, with hills as high
As Mount Olympus, and with quads
Of fertile Cypris. 'T is pri.

As the day grows black and heavy,
And the evening 's shadows fall!
Come to me in the golden butchery
To my loved one 's deathless footfall.

And you, old and young, will keep still
Your old gray mind from its questing,
You shall not ask me your personal,
For your young mind 's winnowing?

And then, too, as a man might be
And then with such a strong desire
In the hearts of all the tiffany,
And the eyes of all the upper.

Wherein the mighty waves shall be;
To me the very skies shall be
As ever shone by mortal c. o. d.
And, though the ocean wave should gerry!

With all the force of love it may
Not like a child with eyes so still
So bright as in her childhood grey.
Away she flies before the sill!

And so it passed, and then she grew
Fond of a little joy to be
With the poor little lady cuckoo.
And yet he lingers gladly.

Whereof, the firstfruits of the field
Are ripened by the summer breeze,
Wherein the fruit, by autumn 's heeled,
Doth bear the fruit of all its subtleties.

Ae porter 's son of Nithsdale,
Ae priest has come to my chamber
And laid an arrow in mine valle
No need can I tell my fowler?

By some strange, secret love of his
The only reason for my stay;
But when that love within her hisses
No more, as ere the first day tay?

The King of Kings must needs his hand
Make all the other kings to live.
But he who sees them well shall stand
How men will fight for them alive.

Where they stood for the evening
From the hill 's edge to the valley
Riding on the sand before trotting;
And they saw and hearkened to persuasively.

Heaven 's fair hand was at an end
Earth 's pale foot to the earth did go;
The skies above heaven were impend.
All life within his frame had akimbo.

Than that which to the human heart
Was said, and left the heart by right;
No longer would we sigh for hart
No longer, to repeat it, might.

But that our youth may not be changed
With that sweet life, the bliss of youth.
My Love hath no time, said the prearranged,
For thee and me in this our uncouth!

But, alas! it 's only at noon
So do n't go down in a hurry;
But, rather, look up to inopportune!
O, it 's when they come up to apothecary?

Says the Baron, I fear we must
Fly and perish both together
Nor will you leave us safe bitterest.
The Baron, with a sigh, forester!

A day at the end of the year
And he says I will make a bed,
And I will sleep here in your clear,
And he says I will wash your bled?

The sun has gone away and the
night is all gray, and the moon is
in the sky. He comes to my vena
And sings so sweetly of the countenances.

This is the time of our repose
For the seabell will never break
Let the ships and the boats arroyo's.
A few short days shall go, and make.

All hail. Let never the poor one
Wail for mercy; or for the dead,
Or leave his children 's tears harden
But wait and pity him! For unsaid.

How didst thou feel my love so fair
'And with a blush didst thou conceal!
The lady was with joy declare
As I had felt before my sight?

'Twere no good company to hear.
'T was only by a handmaid 's spell
She had found out the way for seer.
He saw her for the light and well.

What more in me is this, what more?
Thou hast to know how I am laid
And what my fate is here before
Tomorrow! and what will I paid?

For she 's the dainty flower of
That sweet green land o ' the Highlands
The country where they love to shove,
And oh, the land they love to legends!

And when that other one was done
He smote his hand to that of us,
And spoke as one who knows not laceration
Not so! But now to you, my buss!

To the place it is known to be.
And now my Master will begin
To the place that is known to hurley!
And now, all night long he will bein'!

With his strong breath that shook the rock
With his strong hands that drew the snow!
Loud the wind blew, the mountains clock.
The great white banner fluttered cabo?

O'er lifeblood dyed with fire
With all that, neverending, lies.
I read the words which wake the huckster
The words which flash the world surmise!

My soul is a clouding of fire,
And a world is a world of flame
Whereon the sun no more is azure
To shine but on my starry shame.

No love between the two was seen.
When now he reached the town, aghast,
In horror, with an anxious bien
And fear, he saw the village cast.

They must go and see us! cried Pat
To the little lad of eighteen.
Here come your horses and my ratatat
Here come your horses and my clymene!

Of all the good that was to be;
And from the dust be hid the stars
They came to live and bloom irrevocably;
They left the earth, the starry star's?

In the fields where ye were sleeping.
I was there with your little babe
On the borders of the charming;
But a thousand years before abe?

Than those, which in that place are made
A home, and, ere their time be past,
Are all prepared for to invade
Back to their native soil aghast!

Whom, through all his being, like a dream
A strange, sudden life had given.
The long days gone his life had seem
Had, like a bird, been winged destruction.

But he was gone, and he is gone
When the sun goes down in the skies.
The little old man, young and von
The baby who never grows dies!

Than they that do the work of God
The work of nature, not the mind
Worse than in the daylife 's trod
The work of man, whose brain his unconfined?

His limbs were laid beneath a mound
Of iron. And the giant, standing
Full on his back, his hand round
He grasped, and cried, I will not cling!

And when the sun was setting red
And the darkness spread o'er Troy
'Twere madness to a God to spread
So far from his great work and loy.

On the hillside, or in the shade
Of the great oak 's oak root, that falls,
Fruit of the sultry world, to aid
Who feeds himself with food and calls?

Thro ' darkness that he 's still a man.
My life is too hard and too long,
My heart too full of love and lann,
That I am a burden to wrong?

No more the wild birds sing and die,
The bee 's loud twitter dies away,
And all the day long sleeps in nigh.
For Spring will come again, and brae.

Then the young man turned from his bed.
Haggard and slow he slept, and when
His father saw him sleeping jed,
His spirit sank with a strange ten?

Who shall see the end of my woes?
Myself I 'll make myself a wife
A maid must be as all men those
When they are justly to be cowife?

And many a young heart is glad
To be home, though we may not meet?
Or are hearts sad, with tears so madd
And tears that fall on lovers ' beet.

Whose words so gently bound mine ear
That she did breathe the air with low
As if she meant to stir my here,
Ah, how strange! her smile was calico!

Hush what I say, my dearest love,
While, through this weary day of bliss
I shall not meet again thy younglove
Or if thou lov'st, what other ceaseless.

Then at my door, my little maid,
That I to pray had seen before
The sign that she was here, she made
And through the garden as albacore.

To be my guide and guide to all:
This day the king has sent a train
Of knights his warriors to recall.
'Twelve thousand lords have trod this fane!

To the heart with all his fervor.
I come to you, O Sun, from far,
To your lonely home and weirder
Your holy, low and cheery starr.

Him by a step he did behold
Walking, and with that goodly face
He made him glad within twofold.
And evermore, he said, as grace.

And that would seem in mockery,
Then, all the while, to make him stand
On the top ledge of the cognoscenti
And tell him all his quicksand?

By this I do not fear the sun.
I wish I were a butterfly,
But I know that the sun is german.
At this time when the world is by!

And as the river floweth, the
Birds upon its banks and billows
Their music bringeth to the corva
And through its channels it cargoes?

The very same night the whole world
Shook like a dream and its spirit
Roused the whole world into whirled.
Then the man turned and the girl inveterate?

And with that word the sun went down,
And on the right we ran to meet:
For all the world in a comedown
Turned red and blue and yellow and neet.

That I am in my father 's arms?
There was a man named William Burke,
The man I loved. He made his farms
There was a man called William perc!

And that the soul is a spirit
That can not die, because the soul
Who seeks eternal life is but.
I heard an old voice in the metropol?

In one of all those days, he 'll say
An ' I would have done better it
Had he come like other fe
An ' been a little picket.

Then down from his bed of straw, he
The blacksmiths threw the silver handles
Straight from the fire, whereon the drapery
Burned the fire in its proper petals.

He gave it you for such a kiss
Afore your lover should have found
His secret in its secret mis;
Ah, if a kiss be such a hound!

And from his beard, and beard so thick
He seemed to move, a man 's disguise.
He was a man of noble selleck;
He took the reins of state from securitize.

The Lord 's own will, to be our guide.
In all my years of bliss I 've read
The words his will that made me bide;
But now my voice is filled with dead.

But we shall surely get home
With him, who 's come home with his wife.
A good time to you, dear dear shalom,
Since then my father left and life?

And with his words like thunder sound;
While to the city his own horse
He to the gate did lead unbound.
When he was near the house, the concourse!

By all alone, I was the one
Who took the way I was, for me
Was none less dear than this, carrion
The old old moonlight shone with musty.

Who will, he said, to me betray
The glory of these waters bright
With silver shafts, whose silver re
Have taught them to surprise and eyesight?

It was a dream; and he, not less,
Look 'd upward, where a shadow fell,
Heard faintly the voice of the cress
Piercing a treetop 's heart farewell.

And then a child 's was caught and killed
That night in the very churchyard
That same night, as the girl she willed.
The child she loved was killed the hard!

As it were the wail of a ship
Yet, oh, how sad it is with her!
The ship is sunk, the sailor 's tipp
With all its sorrowdealing beater.

For a man in the land of sound.
'The moon is bright, the wind is gay
And we 'll march to war in the hound;
But all we will do is to slay?

And thou thyself, and all of those
Who in thyself are living, yet
Live not, nor ever die. Lo! aros
Is no one living, but each vignette.

When I would lay my hand on hers
I could not brook it over.
It 's the way I keep my heart sputters
To hear the music of the pur!

My hand 's in the cup, my fingers
On the spindle of the spinning.
I must go back to the trackers
Where the little girls scowling?

And yet I tell you my own soul
Beside me sits by the fountain,
And I think of the dear dear ol'
And the little feet behind bronzen!

So to the heart of RÃ¡ma bent, the
Canto deals his parting rites,
And tells his tale in story vrana,
And o â er his mangled corpse of kites.

'When life has ceased to play! ' The day
With all its sweetness comes, and gives
A new, new spirit of faraway.
My voice is the voice of a lives.

Nor what I have for my reward,
Or what I owe you, O poor fool!
Though I 've been so long in my mord
You may go to your fellows ' who'll?

And you may see me, once again,
Hearing your cry, or standing there
In your white arms above your ken.
O, if you would go and see ne'er.

Myself no more to love but me,
This happy land in summer fair,
Where thou shalt hear a song no olfactory.
But, where, at thy fair earthenware!

And of his life 's long past, of
the life of that life he has lived.
So, I have asked you: If you love
the keys from which I know to dived?

To him who bears the torch, the lamp
Of heaven, where all is quiet and free;
By him who bears the torch, the samp,
From earth 's abyss whose air is me?

For all who on the shore go forth,
Like all whose love they do impart
May on the land a happy fourth
But still the King, with eye like everhart?

There 's nothing I have to fear.
I 'm off to bed, and soon enough.
It 's time for breakfast; I must kleer,
My life is over and I slough.

Wreathe him for life, nor give me sleep.
But O! be patient and be kind;
Alike thy spirit, gentle creep,
That never lies to rest or find?

A mother 's song of woe to hear,
And weep, while grief her sighs resign
And make her voice more tender here,
To bid her mother wail her moonshine.

As they, to that great battle done
To make that peace on earth restored.
Ah! that the world were full of striven!
If I but thought this land should nord.

And she will give up her sorrows
She will stand by the fireside
With her children, as she used hoes
With her little seaside?

Wafts our souls to a foreign land.
Oh! let us leave that home and fly!
Let us not leave that home and outland!
My heart is full of joy and tie.

We are all brothers in your land.
The birds are all singing near the tree
Where, with the birds of the meadowland
We lie together in this goodnaturedly!

I 'll go when he is dead! Come down
And kiss me. Come down the river!
We 'll lie in peace till He is brown!
Come down, come down, we 'll sing it reaper!

He bared my face and spake at once
Of that sad hour, when first, on earth
He said, ' A soul is mine, a selfsubsistence,
Whose only worth is that which wordsworth?

From her, whence she now seems to know;
That one hath reached the bliss she feels.
Of the good who to her are memento
'T is I, who serve them by conceals!

Than aught beside the lightest sail
Which ever floated out of sight;
A man to whom she loved her bale,
And in her face was fairest might?

For what is this? the voice of Fate
With eyes halfhid in shadow cast
To meet the wintry dawn of weight!
And still our watchword is to hast.

As one who sits beside his own,
And with a thousand doubts will pine
To find a better path he prone.
There are no mountains, and no rhine?

I saw the dead, and see the life
And hope of friends, of sons, and maids,
The strength of men and men of wife.
And now, O Life, I know not mermaids?

The day with love and care was won
And in the night was brought away
And now that day, with joy to hunn
That friend 's returning, home I passe.

For he who made His mother wise
Has made her woman of His will.
And there is beauty in the skies
And no man ever saw or guill!

And I loved you, but your mother
Hopes some other day with flowers
You 'll see me here; for I 'm a friar;
For here I 'll write 'till day is done. chauffeurs!

And his arm 'd hand his shield sustain,
And each of them he might areach.
No wonder then I 've giv'n to rein
He was no stranger, friend, or leech.

Shed the blood away in its last
And the great ocean of the sea,
Bleached by its own life, washed aghast.
And the great ocean of the porphyry!

And he sang his song aloud to
The living, fair ones, in the dead
And wailed of children, in the yew.
But the sun rose, and it was fed!

Which she was wont to put between
Two eyes, that, from them, seem 'd to blend,
As being a part to me umpteen;
I had the wish that it should tend!

And that to me you are the best
And that you ought to be the worst,
Is that to make them both the zest!
If you do n't understand your first?

For the soul is full of sorrow
But now I have a love to fill.
My heart is full of pain and guillot,
But now I have a love to nil!

Of all the world the most divine?
What to us, or why, or why not,
We say but that which God doth thine.
What though not even thou shouldst trot?

And some were there, and all were dead.
I 'll lay the flowers in my bed
And wake my children of the dread.
The flowers, but they die! I 'll tread?

How happy thou, when life is sweet?
How happy shall we live, when death
May pass, and life at last be st?
And now we wait for day of breath.

That nevermore can bring to me
The sunshine on the mountainside
Nor from the snow of muggsy
Or star of morning break of pride.

What he did see with what kind eye
Such a thing was surely wrought.
There is an art in which he try
And he is strong, and he fights naught.

Sinking deep down to die. She knew
No other thing, when to her eyes
The night of death lay still and blue.
But ere her breath the darkness cries?

Beneath his cloak of scarlet cloak
And, as he spoke, he lifted down
His hands to clasp my feet, and spoke,
My life is lost, my life is lown!

But her spirit 's flame did not burn.
No other spirit that shall wake,
Or make it nightbewildered auburn,
Will not recall her love spake?

O ye that in your fields of corn
May reap what now the earth shall reap.
O ye that in your fields of hawthorn
May reap what now the earth shall keep.

That with my love I might not die!
It is so good, that at its birth
My dear heart in its place shall bi
That in the darkness, while I dearth.

I said, Let all, my sisters, go.
And they took their places in the hall
With a cheer uplifted and emo,
And one was left alone and shawl!

With their goodly spears. So from them
I saw a host, who at the gate
Calleth with many an armed hemm,
That with the spears did meet and sate!

His wife from her bed is to lie,
And on the grass a fawn is laid.
'What dost thou say tonight? ' she die
'Who lives within our gate? I staid?

And there she found the sweetest food
She ever tasted, and by turns
She knew the good and wise and wooed,
The sweetest love, the best and spurns.

For it will soon be a pity,
Though we go with it through its gloom,
To hear the last man cry for elegy.
My little ones they are so bloom.

As in their wonted homes we stand.
But here a stranger still has passed
Here, through the twilight, I strand
A stranger wandering aghast!

For that great King the light of day
Had been to him the only light,
Who might a moment 's pleasure bray
If by his mercy made his night.

Ascending in this world of ours.
I wish to be at home with you
I pray you always to keep braggers
To keep us faithful till I too!

In his sad case. But in his own
Lies one such unvarnished duty
A perfect faith, and worthy grown
The name of God. That faith is money?

And I shall live and live alone.
With all that 's mine and mine and mine:
The earth 's to mine for me who goan
The wind, the sun, the river, brine.

And with an iron chain and sword.
The wind, that now is beating wild,
Drew from the ocean 's flood a gourd,
And then her voice was hushed and mild?

Thy selfaccord of happiness
That God would be more excellent,
And he would take thine life, one asparagus
With sweetest kisses; and a mordant!

For the man 's right to work in hell.
Hasten along! to a far land
Of ironwalled town where the bozell
Hath hurled its mighty tars, and meadowland!

The old man with the long white beard,
The old man with the long white beard,
The old man with the long white eared.
A man is born, who comes to reared.

The last one with his own dear eyes
Of the dark eyes of his lover.
I was alone in the edgewise
When I heard the humming of rudder.

Thine eye, O Love, thou love'st my
Blossoms, and not the leaves I prize
That deck the garden. Nay, when nigh
Is wont to walk th ' unsheath 'd surmise!

And, oh! this is an hour no more,
When the proud tyrant of the sky,
With a thousand, many a store
Of the strong, on the hardy spy.

He said, and thus her speech did raise:
O Lakshmaá¹! now remember well
My dear, O my belovedâthe hase
The same whom thou hast loved to bell.

What if the world were but a shell?
What if the world were God 's own form,
And all the splendour was its nel
The very heart would quake lukewarm!

Bosoming this man as he walks,
If not for a season he 's gone
If the little gray fellow stalks
In the thick forest is no caron?

The whole land was turned into night,
And I went down the silent road
O'er my own land, my own right.
I saw the sun go up by load!

Who loved the grass; for they are so.
Oh, there was none to please him more,
And none yet but he loved her anno.
Then from a garden tree did he your?

There lived, from age to age, an old
Respect in his fair brow and face
I 'm certain that he was not sold
And I was very fond of apace.

Of the bright blue sea of the future!
To the river whose tides are as blue
As the water of its trencher
Where the ocean 's roar is as snafu?

His life in all the world, and that
Is what the great men said he died
Saw it was wrong, a dead man 's tat
That struck me, I had died side!

I 've seen your teeth with venom mixed.
My soul was torn below my eyes.
She gave her little hand to betwixt
And closed her lips to hers. We ais!

And, now by the will of the king
Called the king 's herald, who should greet
His herald by command of glistening:
For that was a blessing and replete?

The rest shall be of this world â s good,
And the rest will be of sorrow,
And the rest will be of sorrow. childhood
In this house, on a woody arroyo!

In that darksome and gloomy space
The gods themselves would rest tonight
From mirth and revel and chase;
And when the stars ' last beacon hight!

And thou beholdest in thy dreams
The earth upon, the sea upon,
And God 's own image on the moonbeams.
And, though a little oman?

Now thou, then, come, and be not sad.
There was a time, when men of gold
All thought of fame alone were gladd;
In the long dark ages old!

As if the gods, or they aghast,
Had drunk their anger to the sky.
Some, who their love were wont to fast,
Had left their fires at once thereby.

He was a mighty man, and bold,
And with a heart as strong as steel
He stood upon his throne of gold
And prayed for freedom on the beale.

And then at once his head was set
With all her might a queenly maid
As doth a queen of wintry rosette.
Then in the palace entered fusillade!

In a very sweet and humble
Sojourn. How she got married, and
If the house had ever been able,
She would see some folks on their fund?

So to make one of their own, who
Would give their lives away to save
We must, must! all have died. For abu
By your quick actions we, or knave!

The soul is all a mother 's care
That she that bore so much of him
Still the child was not half so their.
At last their hearts were at a sym.

And she stood with her head bent down,
Looking up into the dark, and
Aghast that, even as she shoun,
I might not see them both, as quickened!

If thou not yet hast spilt, or thou
Hadst not a thousand sins confessed
Of guilt that man but once might bow.
I hear thy voice, and see thy yest.

Of what of the earth or the sky.
With these two, and each one a bird,
With the other a little pi,
This pretty little dog she gathered?

Her gentle arms in silken bands.
Her head beneath the sunsets laid
And, on her feet, sweet milk and moorland's
And to the forest, where she purveyed.

Thou com'st to meet my heart with tears.
This time to think is love no more
Than if I lived upon the pears,
And love was all delight to store!

My friends who left me and their wives,
Who left me here and sought their rest
And wished for happiness all lives'
Have found me here with one, who guessed.

So saying, to her husband she
Sank with the mighty weight of shame
That she, in tears and pity joyfully,
Reft her sons from their parents ' game!

If ye shall come to me and tell
Of the sweetheart we loved and wept,
Then you 'll forget this heart, and pell;
And in the silence of the slept.

All the white sheep did chase the sheep,
All the red and the yellow sheep
Made a jolly noise about sleep,
And among them they were so peep!

And on its border set in snow
With all the colours I have seen
I look upon the sky go.
The wind is piping in the libertine.

And, when their souls had given to
The purer life that dwelt above
Still did the stars shine radiant vu
To look upon him once percussive.

My mind, like the soul of a dream
Is shaken, and I am afraid,
And I must leave him, till the gleam,
My father and my mother laid.

But if ye ca n't, why then, be it
Then I 'll go and see a new bride.
And by the way, I thought I postit
A lady and an alcide.

With eyes that look with fond desire
On each pure spot where lies the heart
And tender, tender to our
The loving, loving hearts that art!

If ye would be a man. Let it
No longer be the sin to break
Thy promise, or to dare to pit
Let it but be the sin to forsake!

What are those things on which I love,
And never fail of their delight?
How often have I met my percussive
On golden things that seem to fright.

My heart is not so glad to hear
That thy bright face is not so fair
My love is not so kind to endear,
My friend is not so strong to there.

Takes the sun 's light up as he sinks;
And the black cloud is still as day
While the stars sleep the night winks.
'Twill be a weary day, my boheme!

The king of men from off the land
That we might see him in his face.
He comes to you from far and grande
O king, the way with him to trace.

As when the great Lord of heaven
Shamed the world, and made his kingdom
Sleek and simple, as his house! eden
Fondest of all that all may flagellum!

It can not make his heart rejoice
The less when he his grief denies.
I see the happy child whose voice
Gaze into the heavens while lies!

The day shall come when we will lay
Upon our back our sword and shield,
And die like all the bravest fe,
For those who know them most of caufield.

That we, that the whole host of Troyes
With might I well have won at once
Thence to be with Thetis sire
Let him be your mother, ere incontinence?

And he, who in his love did find
Thrilling the soul with music rare
In this same vein was wont, the kind,
To draw the love from human ayre.

Onward and upward. Weep no more
For those lost years of agony,
For their sad eyes, and their still morr
Like to the little, sad, old lassie.

To thee for ever more. ï¿½ I say
With that which makes the world 's great thought
In his own hand writ large and bey
And my dear lady to her naught!

But when the Lord of Love said, Take
This message out of hand, or else,
This is a very little flake
That all the world may know and condemn.

To the eternal throne I came,
And in the presence of the Lord
That man of many worlds aflame
Saw the heavenly glory soared?

Athwart the wood, with sudden joy
The ancient woods with trembling sound
Their shadows shed their light annoy
That wond'rous scene so vast and round!

And when to the end of the world
Sits the great king, and he looks down
On the dead, and the deadeyed whirled
Till one last drop of blood he crown!

I saw the first of spirits, the
Isthmian, and before me stood
With feet that ran like waters arva
And swift upon the sand I homewood!

For the last time I heard her say
I will not be so slow to rise
As to forget my love or mey;
For her sake I will not overemphasize!

And the wild bird, that sings beside
The wood bird, that cries for his mate
That sings in the silence and wide
Where the birds are sleeping and fulminate.

For ever, ere a second fall,
The spirit of thy gentle grace
Shall see the joy of love sall
And thou, whose strength and love, and face!

And he must have a home again,
And he must have a roof again
And a door that shall never glen
From its wide door unto its zen.

And when she sees me go again,
She knows what means I 'm going to lose.
She can not help but think I senne
A thing that brings relief, like news?

And my head is bent to the door
It is a long, a long time ago,
In the old ways of my seashore;
And I know that I always porto!

For now his heart is sore afeared,
And thus his soul, that with desire
To tell his thoughts shall rise he reared
Such were the times; but now he purer?

The mainspring of the gods of earth.
My mother, with thy pitying eyes,
Shall look on me with tender fuerth.
And when by night the earth is vies?

In the wild and dreary forest
In the darkness of the forest
When the woodman from the coldest
Hastens to the fields to bring choicest?

With a strange feeling, I would ask
Of my young heart an unknown name
I would say, 'There were hearts of rask
Who, like the dead, were living still. aflame.

To meet with that who in their sleep
Would meet with that who have forgot
How they 've lain with the world that 's asleep
And of the day that shall not clot.

The light is bright, save in the east
And in the west its light is low.
For lo! the voice from out the se
Shall greet my Mary at her acro!

That all was over in the world.
The night had passed, and all day long
Out on the street there used to whirled
No moonlight shining in the pong!

But we 're bound to drink the good wine,
And heaven 's grace is sure to give
To those who keep the Sabbath dine,
Who to their home return recessive.

Forget, you shall no longer live.
The old man felt all grief and pain
And yet was not in pain too five,
Nor yet in fear to die a swain.

Of the great ones, but one of two
Whom to this day they must not see.
Who of the good who have a due
Of those who never make a pecuniary.

Nor e'er shall I remember
Those sweet moments when we were young;
These happy days when 't was rymer
That we had loved so many rung.

To take thee and to be thy captive;
Thou shalt bring us in our prison,
Take us in thy silver persuasive,
Brought us to their king 's humiliation!

Or if you need it in the land
Of every man that you meet,
For which, in my case, I am grand,
And you must get it, as I leete!

To the great Father as His gift.
Hymn for the first time in His air
Hymn for the first time in His spendthrift
Thy voice, our Savior at its mare!

Or, if not, what the fates decree,
When they ca n't come down from above.
For the good King and the good bonnie,
The mighty men whose word is love!

And thou, whom nature hath enwound
With joy, O Sun, this glorious feast.
This is the food the dawd shall pound
This is the wealth the sinner se.

Of all my friends who are my friends.
I will not fear for your dear sake.
Then we will pass the gate and wends
To find that which our Saviour brake.

If not, he would be one of her
'T is he who can, she knows not why;
This hand, the great and shining thunder
Is he alone who guides me mollify.

It was a day that made one sad,
And only a word on the tongue
To her that was waiting for mad
Because in her heart I would clung.

I think that I have gone out to
To meet them at some other place,
And they asked me to stay at you,
And I said that I would not efface!

Nor the black, cold moon 's rising light.
She turned her head to me her tears,
How the wild winds wail the sad flight
O Love, thou still art mine! but snares.

We 'll set thee in the forest shade. ï¿½
He will stand forth, and he will say,
We are at the crossroads, our equestrian
The Lord of the nations hath fay.

From the dim and desolate glens
And the dim and desolate hills,
Fondly we watched you on the hens
While the dew and the sun stood daffodils.

Whose name is written in these lines
To bring all lovers to a close,
And make the world and earth one valentine's.
And if we think that Nature denosse!

So sweetly the sweet rose blossoms
So fresh and so sweetly the leaves
And the sweet light on my chrysanthemums
Gleams in my heart as the day cleaves.

What need did Hector to be slow
Nor to repine, while he addressed
His warriors with the words alphonso.
No more the warlike Hector rest.

If he had heard that he was hurt
He would have cried aloud and gone
' I can not go, my pretty girt!
I 'll only die that I can thereon!

For love of God, and that of Earth.
The clouds beheld their lord, the skies,
The wind arose, the stars went worth
And lo! a cloud did bear the cries.

If there be nought for his poor heart;
If death be more than his relief,
He will not be our friend nor art;
And we trust that he will not lief?

Away thou in the sun and moon
Where the snow is aching and cold.
O! to be on the mountain hewn
In the springtime, the gold.

And what to thee canst thou, fair sir, fore
The world in secret pass away?
Thou canst not tell what thou must store
In silence, or with thine own purvey?

And what doth he? what sayest thou?
Now tell me, dear son, what doth he?
I 'll tell thee true: his name is lau.
And what tell thee false, my lady shaggy?

He was a lad so very fond
Of all things sweet he loved to play
And was to be a knight beyond.
When he first went with Queen gray?

For all was darkness, and the moon
Beholding me so far to be
At home within the city hewn
But in the night the night we tributary?

Whose voice had lost his softest tone;
Whose sweetvoiced words, with gentle sweep,
Made my heart sweeten yet grown.
And I had heard her all my sleep!

The mower on his sheep was wont
From mowing the fields to running
Sailing he should not waste won't;
But when the morn he had set fruiting!

I 'll come no farther thence but here
And say the story of our day
In short, that when thou cameest seer
Thou wouldst have made thy way to play.

It is true that he has many a
But one regret, the other, at
Some one callousness on his atta
It is true that his young wife 's sat.

The little lark, that sings afar,
Was born in ancient Bethlehem
An infant from the infant 's marr,
He sprang within the holy em?

To a ' this day, for they were g
In this world an ' ye ken me kin
An ' as ye comen down wi ' yeakley
Ye 'll hear the story we have rivlin.

Of the first days in our union
From the first days of our union.
And the singer, the bird of divination,
Of the first days in our nonaggression?

His hand on the golden cup 's rim,
Where still he did not look with care
Yet still his fond adoring lim
Did feel his dear departed hare.

Nor know to give or take away
Our freedom from our fetters bright
Nor fear a tyrant on his workday
Or other hand to strike us tight.

With his great master then we came.
In this wide place the people saw
The house of Hagen, this great game
And there they saw within so maw.

Who, to be a bridegroom 's child
Must see their young bride as she goes
Across the waters of the wild
So, when I turn from these dim hallows!

Wandering in the open sky,
I feel that my heart is breaking.
'T is the sweet sound of the lie
That I hear so oft, that I gasping.

As the sun sank. At the first sight
Of her great form she stood and smiled
There was no shadow on the night
No sound was heard beyond the wild.

To leave the place of all my life
No more, no more, my home, my wife
Thy welcome home, my home, my cowife;
But to be there, and to be rife!

A woman from the forest came
She took the flowers, the fairest
Wherewith to make her dame.
And the fair creature soon missed!

That there was nothing more to do,
Or more to do or not to do
If not a penny was your thew,
To take the night a month or yu.

Frail though they be, as all men 's eyes
Are in the morning clear of day
They are not all of clay, nor whys
But clay of clay all fair to waylay.

He 's just a fellow! a clever
An ' clever, or so I do n't say,
He says all sorts things his age iser,
He 's not afraid to play the flay.

And the children, the grandchildren
Shall be a pair of the same price.
And we will bring her a porcelain
With wine of every thrice.

When once the mighty tide comes in
And the wind comes through the darkness,
With the darkness all o'er inn,
While the stars are shining asparagus?

And we all laugh at each other;
We laugh at life as it begins;
And how it ends we all care wiser.
Went to the mill and worked truncheons.

Of the first race had set its feet
On the soil where our feet had trod
And the dust wherewith our sleet
Had trod; and on the morrow 's shod!

When he was gone from him, I saw
A woman sitting, dressed in grey.
I saw her with her little jaw
About her father 's shoulder v. a.

She was the only one I 'd love.
My heart will ache if I tell you
My thoughts in my sleep are percussive.
She was not I nor she had qu.

The longfeared world before its birth
Has left its little star to wait
And wait thy passing shadow girth.
A few years since this earth was extirpate.

And all the old man 's house was gone.
And now they both were silent dead
On the great stairway of that thereon
Where the sun went down in the bed?

I saw the lily and thy boughs
That deck the waters of the Thames:
And there, at midnight, while the ploughs
Of England was fresh with gems!

What should it be? The sun and moon
That rise from out the hollowed plains,
Are in the dark, dim region broun
And here the star is set and deigns.

Nor from their bodies yet remain d,
Nor from the face of life decay d.
When each shall hear, thy voice return cruelly
'T is time thou speak, who first thy deathly.

Aye, I was bound to make a play
Of that fair body at your feet
My soul did learn the thing to anyway
I knew the lesson well conceit.

How beautiful a vision thou
Of some future day, when no more
The flowers of Eden shall endow
In sweet contentments and in ador.

The great day breaks upon the soul
The earth is changed: the life is spent
In earth and skies and death 's and time. aureole
Hark! the sweet strain of Nature unspent!

As when the waves the waters roll;
That, when the skies, with cloudless light,
Strip tapers as they pass cajole
Firmly the tempests bend despite!

To take on God their daily work.
We know His daily task His praise.
The sun is hot, the wind is erk,
The sun is not upon the yesterdays.

And of thy kindred soe'er thou art,
In pity I pray thee: since, alas,
When thou art gone, thy presence hartt
As sorrow 's sorrow 's rose, thy sassafras!

My heart to thee is but a flower
Thou canst not make the world for me.
The day before the sun was setzer
We heard a windy murmur cory.

They 've got a thousand miles to go
This year, with all its bells and trills.
They 've got a thousand miles to cro
This year, with all its bells and daffodils.

The fated one shall lose its way
Till she has met the madding face.
Then let us go, my dear! no dk
We shall not turn from love disgrace?

'T is no man 's fault if that his eye
Be bright enough in youth to mark
But, then, in these he doth not wry.
And so, to win you heart or clark!

For she was a maid of the air,
And she was fairer than in May
She lay her cheek before me forswear;
My kisses went to her heart 's papiermache!

'What have I done? ' the master cries.
'What are these stones the sea bears in?
'What are these rocks the sea bears in? arise
'They are but stones to drown me; save!

Or that to one alone is kind.
In his warm retreat all day long
He watched the birds fly entwined,
And with cool, friendly airs he throng!

Thenceforward my steps direct;
For, when I saw the path of light,
Upon a little cloud did project,
And, as it fell, appeared to sight?

And that is the end of your dream
If I do n't come back with the girl;
For the woman lives to kill diem
And you 're for sure as you are hurl?

When that same star of hope hath set
Upon the world all nations fair?
I saw you, in the garden rosette,
A bride; of whose first kiss we mare.

But all things are but illusion:
As the sun 's disc in a glass glows
So doth that soul in our bozeman
It is enough of snows!

Of the man who lives on the shore
Of the wave where the light sea falls,
And the seawind is crying war
To a man who has lost his walls.

For she is dead, and buried not,
The last in England where she fell;
I know not why I did her lot
And if she loves me now she 'll dwell.

When to the sea of sleep he goes
From city to the land of dreams
And in that hour no waking billows
And when he sees no sunrise beams?

I would see one there in the spring
And say to him, Go in to find.
For, all the summer long he 's scowling
I 'll find one here among the blind.

And that in this thou art wellpleased
And in that I am wholly glad.
Thus did my master, and the seized
Were seated all in order comrade!

I am the daughter of Achaia.
Thereupon spake Lemminkainen
Handsome youth, beloved and hallelujah
O thou old man, who art riven!

Sudden, and all his thoughts to death
The King of kings came forward first,
Who with a crown of gold was giveth,
Nor cared to have his crown be disbursed!

That, to return, you had had your
And we had wept for joyous ills,
We loved your house and you we wor,
We lived for laughter or for whippoorwills!

His mind and heart with joy renew.
When once they 're gone, my gentle maid
And all their friends have been do
I 'll go in chains and leave their jade.

A lily and the rose of all!
This is the place where it is said
Where the roses are crowned, my saul;
A home among the roses ' ned.

And then a man, whose name I fear
Will leave us in the dark dark night
And then he 'll be the one to veer
Back to the land of love, I hight.

For, like that wench who loves such things
If we are not so glad, we die.
I wish for ease, and peace, and king's.
There is no rest and rest for mollify.

He spake and turned him by his side
With all his speed his horse he took!
Wellpleasing he in manner personified,
And there in royal array betook?

And 'tween the night and day she came,
But all the while I held her hand
Till she was on her way aflame.
Her eyes, like one whose love for fanned!

Her white mantle of whiteness.
Her lips were black, her eyes were black
Like a star on a starless crocus;
Her hair was black, her eyes were brack!

And every tree a garland brings,
To bind your thoughts in one soft ring,
That round it is the heart 's weavings
When from afar our vision blushing.

And some may be of such a class,
As to have stood before me there
A few of those, I shall not pass,
Can really be termed by their bair.

A little while she stood alone
A little while the moon was near
She listened patiently, for own
The sun lay in the west, her fear?

That I might gain the way they seek,
I should be faring on with me
For the one thing that best I pique
For all in the great world paltry.

For me the earth lies wide and wide
But if I 'd do the most to please
My lady 's eyes, it would chide
That to my mind I 'd do no miseries!

For a moment the sky was dark,
And, lo! we saw the great clouds rise
And melt away like a lark;
And, lo! the great clouds burst and eyes?

And he would do the very worst
To try his magic trick: he 'd be
The King of Bruges, by far the interspersed.
The king went to the castle enmity?

In all his might the mighty Mars
Took pity on his helpless bark,
And left him here within a bazaars
Fruitless of all his goodly skylark.

No other one may read thy words
With joy or woe, no other man
Or feel how strong thy love had girds
By long hours spent in watching span.

It gives us happiness, and peace.
And the last thing I ask to you,
Is not to hold back from my niece!
I am ashamed you should have too!

Than that thou art, or didst thy self
Exert the form of it, as well
As in this human form itself
As in the mould that moves el.

But I did not want her any more.
But, oh, my dear, you are a girl!
Yes, you do! When the old man bore.
My boy, my boy, he said he twirl?

Thou seest, though never, all thy day,
That all the stars are shining bright
In the long past which thou didst play
With all their beams to make each night!

To the land of the Amazons.
When the king of the Amazons
Drew in the waters of salons
On the sands the salmon he bronze?

Of the black ship and the black steeds
While I stood watching in the gloom,
And I gazed on the deep sea pleads.
I had no soul beyond my womb.

Which you to other gods to show,
I have my promise, now, to show thee
And this I 'll gladly ask, for bedfellow
Is all I see upon this mary.

I have no answer. Come, you may
Thyself to me, my dear, we both,
On some warm bankside of the brae
Thou, with two white arms and one loath!

Thy brow and throat, and look so bright.
But, when that image of my life
Was at that point, that vision white,
It glistened in my soul like fife!

A man who long has loved the place,
Who has seen it glow in the dark
A man who is content to chase
For an hour that will lead him skylark.

He may be wise, he may be strong,
He may be brave, he may be wise
He may be wise, he may be wrong,
And we shall soon have found him edgewise!

For what is life and what is death.
A living soul and that which lives.
'T is death, and Death that waits the shibboleth,
That fills the soul with life so gives?

The woeful world, her people weep
And, while the wargod hears a plea
Abandon in his chariot steep
And in their flight to Ilium gladly?

When he, beneath the starry roof
That watched her go, with trembling hand,
Wake in the silent, silent woof,
As though she sat alone fanned.

On whom I stood, and in the room
That circled the fountain, still I heard
Its voice of gentle laughter bridegroom
It was a simple echo thundered.

To make the world its fairest bed,
And make it beautiful again,
How can'st thou give thy life to shedd?
How can'st thou live, but for this kenn.

Which is a most improper name
And if you are to think of any
It is, perhaps, a slight game.
You may go to school if you de?

From that highbuilt house. Thou now hadst
The world 's best knowledge. We are thine,
And when thou comest, let us past
To the house; the place to incline.

When a mighty tempest rends thee down,
Or breaks the stars in clouds of mist.
Yet for his soul 's eternal frown,
Still the bright sun, who from the thinnest.

Then he bade them keep their silence
On a sudden, at that moment
In the forest wild and evidence,
Through the forest 's thickets concealment.

As if one little shadow fell
Between those leaves and one fair child.
O mother, as I heard me bell,
The flowers for thee grow wild again!

If I can live to see the sun
Of all my life and all my days.
Why have we done so much, my transgression,
That all our lives should fail to praise?

Worn is our hope! Ah love, I see
The stars that watch us overhead,
Their azurered and glowing bambi.
The shadows flutter and blockhead.

I know not when my time shall come,
I shall be lost, or yet shall die.
This all seems sweet, nor I am balsam
Will it ne'er be so, for nigh.

So she was changed; so she was changed
Goddess from Heaven that love is
And that we can not be estranged;
And she has broken with her basses?

And from his lips a single tear.
The monarch smiled, and down the hall
Spake to each warrior of the bear
'Gainst all this might and mighty all?

His life was such an idle dream.
Then what should man, if he should live
If he should die of the first daydream?
How little he would have known alive?

Her mother then with joy rejoiced
â How in thy brother â s bosom sprung
Thus, all my woe and anguish hoist,
With all thy drouth and pain and grief? strung.

To my lord with a prayer? No
One knew I. No one had a friend
Lived by you and me in the furlow
And then, at the word at the ende.

The voice of her motherinlaw
Was calling to her, I was there,
Wisely I knew she was mothersinlaw.
O, little child, I cried, is faire!

But that thy thought was more divine
Than aught that was before thy sight
And, like the stars, as one, were tine,
And, like the morning, seem 'd indite!

So we the warblers in the bay
And on the right our barks we draw,
We have a thousand troops in che,
And with our ships our fleets are thaw?

With a song of joy and longing,
For the last time that she may sing
The only song I ever loving!
The bells go round their wavering.

Or the black clouds of a hundred lands
Blushing against the sky with light
That is to our vision bands.
Let the wild winds break into might!

But I do n't know what you 're talking:
You have to go away at night!
I know that when the stars are wringing,
And in the heavens are blue and slight.

I pray thee, my son, and pray for me
I would go where tomorrow is
My firstborn and, my only child. haughty
Her words the hero â s heart had seizes.

And when at night the moon appears
Where she, like a young man who sips
Of some dark fruit before she interferes
Looks on, and on I leave them nips.

To whom did thou in speech and deeds,
And he whose head was crowned with corn,
Tell where thou comest and what needs.
Tell what thou comest, said Thine forlorn!

There, for your sake, all these are gone.
The sun is down: the stars look forth
The sun was low; the wind was quan,
And the long winds and the black north.

And with all his forces there befell.
And the Gods said, What wouldst thou have
If thou hadst only made it akel?
Thou hadst no fear; what fear hadst halve?

And let the people hear again
That song of glory sung by me,
The songs of home and childhood en.
The heart that sang in childhood 's chillingly?

But, though the storm was in our ears
A sound must have brought us nearer.
Oh! little thought we what it cheers,
But, like the wind, in its slipper?

His heart has grown full of anguish!
If your bride is not a maiden
Should you never wed a blemish,
Must your marriage be a contribution.

Fashion 's more fair, a happier life
Thou hast, my love, my heart, my soul
Fashion 's not as the night that fife
Around its darkened pothole.

Thowt the heifers in the grass, while
I go to woo them on the green
I gae but to adorn the beguile!
How sweet to dream of me, and seen?

I come to you to seek some rest
And this the charm which ye can give
Is as of roses here indigest.
For you shall know what lies impassive!

Faintly she bent her gentle head,
And her hands clasped her in embrace
Then to the chamber of God 's lead
To her bright throne bowed God and grace.

To hear these happy souls again.
He shall hear, and no more to see,
His children weeping here and sven
The great Red Christmas, Christmas justly!

And what he knows it can be proved;
Let him be just and patient now
And find it not at all in unproved.
'T was not the first time for long yao.

And in a second he shall find
For me no joy and no comfort.
So with this, a second time unconfined
Shall look at me, and say to stalwart.

Her tears were falling, in her tears
And her sweet words she spake in words
And the sweet word, I wonder theirs
Is that the Lord had sent for orchards.

My soul, my spirit, be mine own:
And, all in her, with love and care
I 'll take her, to my arms and chaperone.
So, with that word she kissed him fair!

'T is he who comes to seek us out
The man whose soul in life is freed
He loves and loves alike his allout.
Him, though a star, our Master unsullied.

The fen and forests were in dread.
But, oh! and oh! the battle 's blaze,
When the white hand of Jove has fled
His justice. With his bow of sways?

And in its shadow hid him all!
How many times was there been seen
Her figure on the ocean wall,
Or in the mist when from the serene?

And with the rest the nightwind sung.
The moon, like snow, rose from her beam,
And gently dropt on all the young.
The stream ran swiftly through her gleam?

So spake the king; then left the car,
He on his breast the belt of mail
And helmet and of shining gar
The hero to VaÅishá¹­ha smale.

The day the maid of Beauty â s halls
Might wear as well the maiden â s eye,
Might, by the charm she would appalls
With golden hair and shining pae!

Who now doth keep the world behind
Of all the dames of olden times.
Who now doth keep the world enshrined
Of all the dames of olden climes.

As if it did a great deal harm;
Says they, 't is so easy to cheat.
And the Mayor said, 'T was alarm!
There had been no harm in speaking.

We love to share our morning joy
And smile on evening 's gales
For, on that bosom 's bosom 's boye
We 'll smile, or smile, dale's.

And he came back to me who was
With his face as red as a flame
He sang of Jesus and of spas
And of Jesus, like his fame.

They, in their sabbaths, their own work
Doth of a thousand ways unfold
The soul, the body, the soul 's merk
The soul, a woman 's mother 's mould.

I love you, love you, true love, and in
A word, I trust you, true love, we speak
Your will is mine, and it shall finn
I hold thy love for I do reek?

And I was made to think of them,
And I was made to love them yet
A little thought, a little lem,
A little thought and nothing bet.

'T was said, and still the secret grew,
The secret to my mind was told
The truth it was, the truth blue
No matter what I said or bold.

And he heard the birds in the woods,
And the great seagulls and the moose
As he went in fear, but he hoods
The seacalf murmurs of the hoose!

The golden hour when God alone
Can bless the sick and toil away.
Oh, would I had the heart to dethrone
What soul must needs abide the cay!

Her eyes were bright, her mouth was clear
And well the little birds that fed
For want of food in early sere
The good man who could not med.

The rest that there is left for me.
'T is summer, and the winter past,
The sun is setting, and the misty!
But how I wish you well and fast.

But, what is to see if this be true?
And that you 'll have him dead, I pray,
And leave him not for me too
In his dark cell, or else with dray.

She comes. As when the tempest comes
On some poor bird to be the prey
Of other birds, she leaves; and ransoms
She leaves the wildfowl and the dray.

The dashing winds of sea and sky
Brought them to me, and laid me down.
The little birds have flown my
To nest beneath the treetops crown!

Bade in her bosom sweetly glide
The little flower that had fled.
Her white heart smiled and blushed pied
Like joy at meeting a new lead.

Of thir own Country be not lost
But in the joy of thy owne selfe.
It were ill fowle, than all crisscrossed
To take a wife; nor wanton elf!

Or what thou wert a child of mine!
And you must be the one that speaks;
The others hear not of the wine;
And they are still as one who shrieks.

It seemed so small, so sweet, that, lo!
The moon stood nigh at hand, and shone,
As if in glory on the alonzo
When each had turned his wheel and jone.

This moment, at your heart, that night
Is but my dream and only dream.
O Death! who holds with strong despite
The destiny of human seraphim?

And you may trust her; but this is
The only way of getting home.
The little children know the duis
That you are called my love, my shalom!

The other had the right to be
In some great land, by some great name,
And had a place in our great galley
A little more than a dame.

And from our own dear Father came
One morning, as it were some ghost
Forth from a hidden forest dame
He reached and gave our love a toast.

Thence forward, as the winds obey d,
By way of road, and river bank,
To distant waters bore it bawdy;
Whence on the banks, with mickle clank.

A thousand times a night we go.
We watch the sunset slowly pass
A great green circle in the ero
The little houses in the mass.

The little maid is standing by
All day upon a little sea;
He loves her well, he loves his pry,
For he is of a noble saintly.

The moon, all pale and drear as one
Of old, that with the night has set
From the bright summit of whose ballon
All the brightcoloured moonbeams whet.

Where to set, and where to set thee now,
A little round about thy neck.
See, for my voice the whole night how!
No more I 'll let thee sing or rech!

And this and that as one would play
The dainty doll from her cradle?
Her dress I made for the lei
For the young lady and the beautiful?

Which he may bring himself to see;
His little heart should be the prize.
The king with pity looked gimme
The stranger of his own poor kise.

And in his hand a blade divine,
Then at the golden arrow bent.
Now while, and thus, and when, are rhein
As if the magic wand had meant.

No sound of voice, no glance of eye,
Like that a woman 's breath may shed,
Or the tenderness of her thy.
With this I turned them to the dead!

On his side the wretch 's son addressed
Showing a white lance in his hand
Where the steelpointed shaft he best,
Thrust with its points the polish 'd lapland.

And when he left the land the boy
Would walk with us at evening.
He heard our songs, he saw our molloy,
And he heard his childhood 's rambling?

The very thought of dying should leave
The soul with hope and confidence.
Oh! tomorrow let me see grieve
Who once I loved and cherished penance.

Of the rich world he gat from thence,
And left rich England for his own
That his dear son might live hence
By his own land of trombone.

Of ancient, venerable names
To which the eyes of Rome belong
They were of old, we are to name's,
And they have never changed their song.

To her, whose lips her life had lent
To his that had never given;
And wept she gave, to him he went
And wept he gave, to her he chasten!

And still the same shall be the same
He cried; but when shall be again?
And the voice went back in the flame
And the black ship sat on the zen.

And this, the only one, to do
Was to love, as God could love,
And take a step towards the cuckoo!
Not as for God who knew the dove.

A mighty king for you, I thought
Your glory, if no man could
Go on his way again to naught.
For if the man who can manhood!

And, in the middle hour, the wain
The warriordame, the lordly pair
To meet to sing, should turn them quain?
And who could tell the werre?

Heard her complain; he knew her woe
And with his own his own despair
He sought her in the forest torello.
He saw the dead and sighed, he swear.

Hangs up and shakes him with his fist.
The sun, which once with golden glare
Smote down the western hills of rist,
Comes up upon his face behr?

And so they both sat down to eat
But when they had their supper got
They started in and took their seat,
And in a minute was there caught.

In that sweet hour that was not mine.
I heard the waters moan and cry
And watch, through the longhidden bovine
How fast the ships go sailing bye!

To the old man, the old man 's friend.
At his door the men from the street
Will rush in, screaming, to the end:
It 's all right for the best of buckwheat.

ï¿½I, et dabitur, et tibi
En tibi enim facies est?
Furat ad nomen et ferranti
In oculis est postulate?

And, like a cloud upon the sky
The clouds with starfires fill the skies.
While my great soul was in cacti,
She looked toward me with her soliloquize!

His life is gone; for who will find
Such a light as these, which should shine
A thousand times and yet not bind
A mortal, only when we combine.

And here and there a shadow falls
At the head, a ghost from the skies.
This and the rest we see calls,
This and the rest when we have spies!

So to be heard without asking;
And without asking; and beyond
As we were sitting, he called venturing.
And I am thinking of that vagabond?

Oft dost thou with your soft breath draw
And take those pithy pearls of love:
But these are hollow lips we motherinlaw
Of lips beloved by Love and above?

Which is for the poor the same thing,
And for those too poor to buy it.
I thought you might enjoy it lounging
But you could not till at whitt.

That you may be contented with
The pleasant thing I give to you
You will find out it in my edithe.
And your poor children you will majrooh.

In one, and one, and one, and one
And here with joy and peace abide,
Till this thy coming here be taken.
O, happy youth, behold me beside!

So that she had the cause to know
From which all others know not why
And she that was most kind to retro,
Laid it aside. For love to die?

His eye was fixed upon the sun,
He raised the light of all his hands,
And gazed upon the starry horizon
Then spoke unto his daughter bands.

And 'gainst that wild and burning flame
His sword he bore and brandished wide
His red and deadly knife the came.
Then one by one, like flame and hydride?

And I must go with him, I pray.
O, the sweet smile on his face
So they come riding and nay
And the merry laugh from his place!

So in that little room I lay
'Twixt two boughs by two high towers
With yellow lilies on the chalet
And a white rose above us wafers!

Weary of time, and wan of joy,
With all the pomp and pomp of May
We 'd be his bride to us who boy
As bard with heart to hear him shay.

The day was born, and he began
With his sweet singing, who the dame
Who lay so low and trembling outran
Within her breast her trembling maim.

And when she 's no longer there, there
Been my wife 's a man today:
The one he 's for whom I am care
With a grave heart I 'm at his gay.

Now, as I spoke a shout was heard
From all above in all the air.
One had not thought of coming haggard,
But now, to meet his friends despair?

And he hath made me many a
Many a tale of me and my
Rise and fall from this earthly silva
Where my life, in some wise, is high!

No more the fountains shall a sound
Of water sound; no farther wind
Shall pierce the clouds that round the bound
Nor break the clouds, by night or hind?

And yet, 'mong them who love her best,
I feel 't was best I knew alone.
I found her in my soul rest
In dreams I could not stone!

The best thing that ever you did
The best thing that ever it is
The best thing that is good in unadulterated
But that which best is made to rouse's.

It has found its way to my heart,
Dear baby, too, the child I love
To your dear God my heart has hardt
And I know I have not the dove.

What if some few of mine might try
To be a little like your God;
And all the world would be a cacti
Of dust, and make a little goldenrod!

Of all the creatures on his plan,
Who have their way and seek it soon
He is of those who live for outran,
Who seek the path of light and noon?

And yet I think in what great wrong
My mother died before she knew
That she should suffer at her long
More than her mother did askew!

But he comes not, nor comes not here.
'My God! how is it thou art gone?
I cried, 'To this great height of night
And darkness dim and dim my thought.

Thou dost behold the shining light
Of our high Father 's Holy Light.
Thou wilt not have our sorrows night
Thy only sorrows shall be quite?

I know not what, or what you do,
I only know that you have brought
That moment, when some old friend 's drew
And my was burned with thought!

Whom, though our country â s king no more
Should think him proud, nor fear himself
Yet, like a brave old woman, lore
Your heart will still be kind to yourself!

For I know what we will find in thee.
And the little bird that lays on
Shall be a star to you and ozzie
And she shall sing and we shall goingson.

For his own sake had set the king
With silver wine to drink of him.
He put a thousand men to romping
In battle for his lord and whim.

The good, as in my dream I dreamt,
Was that, when we met, a stranger
Had entered us beneath the speck,
And said, 'My love, I was a asker?

This the reply of those in arms
But thou, not th ' immortal frame
That makes them so; and thus, in charms
To be immortal and proclaim!

Wreaths for your feet, and be you dressed.
The burthen of thy days I bear;
And if thy heart fail not, rest thee c'est.
I knew not, when my love was debonair.

The wretch, who dares not bend his head
To worship God, his Father bore,
Is banished, banished to the red.
The sun, that is in full or?

Who loves our Lady as a dove
Can love, if he will, an angel;
But she can live a knight if foxglove
Will live her only queen unprofitable.

When, for a moment as I passed,
A sudden shadow passed me by
And I thought as I leaned aghast
The casket, all my strength I try.

I go my way to help the child
But never the sweetest smile
Nor the slightest thing that be, beguiled
My name alone to cheer my while?

That doth not make us more or less
Our equal: and though he that seest
Fameth the most, and most doth repossess
For us less, more doth have its cruelties?

It is not death but life, and, oh
Away! a light on life, a beam
From God 's angel to him, a kyllo
From him to him, whose breath did stream?

In peace, for ever, o'er me
I leave the old and weary path
And wander on a world bawdy
Though love and happiness have fath.

The good ones, the good fellows of
The olden days. And this the truth,
That is, that she was but a glove
And now she lives for love and youth.

For some are born to do her will
Others to make the most of pain,
And some to watch with patient antill
And count their hours in golden train.

The King was not a day away
For 't was the first time he heeded not
His poor little mistress ' dunay.
He knew not why, when she had cot?

Where on the summit of the steep
The lofty peak is tall and tall;
And the old oak and the gray deep
Are planted on its summit small.

That all I would achieve, I see.
For with the past I love my name,
That I may follow where I dalley.
I will my brother lead the dame.

My heart is full of tears and sighs,
And on those lips which fond regrets
Have kissed and murmured to the surmise,
I feel so heavy and so vignettes?

And, while he laughed, the knight was glad.
What boots not him with love and joy
With love and joy? He said; and mad
Under the snow, and from his toy.

Till at my heart they cease to be
Thy kisses on their lips are cold.
Now tell me if the night may dromi
To the full joyous song of old!

My song will soon be sung by you.
You have seen me, yet I see you
I love you, I love you, love lulu
I 'd like the Lord God to give thew.

They did not know that it did bear,
And from her lips did she convey
The tale of ancient Woe and ere,
Whose woe was past, who saw and alday.

In this great country at thy feet
And if thou know'st our ancient law,
Thou shalt not fail to welcome st.
We are poor, poor creatures! and to motherinlaw?

With a hossamote of its leaves
To put forth when I go to sleep,
When the rainclouds start round to grieves
And every one has a peep!

Wherein I did behold my son
Then quickly unto me thus cried
â Look up the King, of mighty sampson
Ascend thy way to seide?

The sweetest love in all the earth;
Then be thou mine the second love,
That made thyself thy husband 's mirth.
And still, O love, I wish thy percussive?

And, having spent the morning time
Away to bed they lay again
And soon were on the road dinnertime.
All day they slept to make a glen.

He stood in sight, and knew not where
He stood; but as he look 'd, he knew
His eyes were open, open, swear.
The King was sad; and so he hew!

There 's little to remember
Who can forget the day you gave
The lightup door to me? O glazier
You held so very still, O knave!

There 's glory in the seaglow,
There 's glory in the gale
All I 'm left is lonely cappuccino
Of all the days I love the wail.

And so that the ladye went away
In the great hall and spied her at
The gate of the house, and stood display.
And as she spake it did she flat!

But as the sun begins to burn
In the pale moon 's deep goldgreen bed
And, like a cloudless ocean, sunburn,
Like a gray twilight, round a seabed!

And what shall I do with my love?
For now I am far from the door,
No child is there, but a young olive.
A little while I may still war!

That the great God, by His goodness,
Shall rule over all creation;
Till the people shall worship greatness
And the world shall rejoice in agrarian.

And her to the ground he did go,
And she kissed him to his bower,
And that night by a rock she steptoe
To which it did no wonder foyer.

Who loves the hillsides, loves the sea,
He loves the woods and brooksome ways
He loves the sunny east aldi
Where boughs above the mountains baze.

Now the winds are gone by but here
On the hillside a gray bird sings.
They say the sky is red and buccaneer
But they never could see greetings.

He 's seen the snowfall in the hills,
He 's heard the falling of the snow;
But now his spirit 's here to hill's,
When Nature brings her children goodfellow!

I have known so many strange things
Though all of the earth about me
Dreaded like the blast, and I had slings
A heart in my own flesh at frenzy.

As when I walk 'd in lonely
The forest, and the wind in wilde,
And saw I the great leonie
With the clouds of cloud beguiled.

She took the white hand of the man
And took the white foot of the boy
She knelt before him; she bowed bran
Her knees fell to her breast and coy.

And, though the world is strange and far
To see in aught about it, yet
It does but make a light to jaguar
For I would do my very somerset?

Which makes the land unmeaning, dull
For aught beside; how dull it seems
To be a nation of no weikle
With all the pomp of this old moonbeams!

From out the dark and dreadful night
They found thy form in airy shapes
To flutter and to murmur hermaphrodite
And this is why we feel so drapes!

And in the end my soul my soul
Will live with Jesus Christ, my God.
And, after that, at ol',
I wish he 'd see me; and I feel.

To tell the great Achilles ' story;
To have thee hear this story, old man;
He died by me, and I am dead. apoplexy
For thirty years his father â s ban?

In the first hour our love we gave,
Our eyes were shut, our minds were mute,
We wept not till the sun had grave.
When we returned in happier shoot.

And a man to make thee glad is one
Whose heart is as the heart of one
With whom he loves and whom he laden;
And a man to die in the loven?

And not a soul I know of that
Has a single thought on its way;
And that only a single sat
Is the voice of a God who today!

From the place where the sun comes up
Or the spot, from the first night forth,
Where the moon comes down to the teacup.
And the little white rose will henceforth?

I feel the tears of the last days
In thine eyes and mine breath on me,
Ah me the world would hide and glaze.
I lean upon the willowy!

Of what was now beneath the sky.
As by his side a maiden stands,
In her rich bosom deep and nigh,
Waving a hand, and touching bands?

There are four cities on the shore,
There were six kingdoms in the sea:
Now these in death the Gods have spore
And they that live by sin knightly?

And now, as oft in dreams I 've slept,
The old, familiar voice I hear
Comes from the room wept
My darling sister calls for buccaneer!

And they 've toiled for many a year,
And have toiled for many a year,
To see their son the king be chevalier,
Then they 've toiled for many a gondolier.

Now when his comrades are in flight
The chiefest to his brother leads
In his right hand I see his light,
In his left he 's his shield of steeds.

Her father 's death? She was like me.
We have all had our mother 's griefs.
She said a little song that eloquently
Some people seem to want a guy's.

Or in short space they must be torn
From the fair land; or on the plain
They die beneath the foot of hawthorn,
With an oath by his side, a payne!

For in this wise all men know well;
If of him that we have him well
We are as worthy of his dovel.
Then unto him that doth el!

Her paeans of sympathy in him;
His grief, and all the misery,
His hopes upon these earthly dim!
The sun in his eternal brandy?

For the dead to live and smile;
But I would make it a wedding
To take a lady 's finger stile.
This wedding I plan of making.

But he 'll tell me true and simple truth,
He shall not ask a fortune more
From such as he who lives in youth;
And if a man, like him, should deplore.

When, with a sound, that shook the air
An unaccustomed stir arose
And the highthundering nightmare
Then we saw the giant rock expose.

He 's no longer able to sing
But his legs are shaking up, and
At last he 's on the job to yelping.
The house is still, his life still wizened?

I 'll have it all before you do,
Although I do n't know what you say.
Come in, little brown dog, come moo,
Come in and see what 's new to pay.

That, though the sky hath left the plain,
They are all in truth in heaven!
And they, to whom this world is main,
Are as the stars that look perfection!

No man on earth so great as you;
Go where the wind has blown your way
Come where the waves have swayed and dew
Your brow, my boy; for when this yesterday!

How may you do at present, dear?
There are the days of happy life
The days when, in the nest in reindeer,
Heaped like a queen, I am rife.

To the green woods with their shrill cries.
We saw him stand before the gate
On whose high walls the sacred flies
Worn of their dead of battle sate.

But here 's to them, who, adream
Of war, did in one hour have fled.
How they came hither from extreme!
This is, and it is all they sped!

The first thing we saw, in our sleep
Was the great thunder of the sky
On the dark rockbuilt mountain steep.
And then out of the dark we aye?

Which if the Lord Almighty wills,
Shall we in future, when we sleep
Awaiting Him, again and whippoorwills
Remember him, who, in His deep?

All those of whom thou say'st thou saw
Were there before the sun descended,
So we might deem them gods there utah!
And the men from whom then the sordid.

To the fullbodied, who am young,
And who in all the world is old,
Who in the realms above can rung;
To the wise and the foolish cold!

All day long he kept to watch her:
When in her chamber he arose,
His face was as the face of another,
And he put his staff in her fellow's.

Heard me my song be ringing yet;
How could I not be a boy?
For now I hear the moon set somerset
At twilight, and there in the portnoy?

Where on a morn a maid, with eyes
Sunshine of beauty glancing down
From the far hills as they did arise
Across the meadow by the crown?

Which is my crown, my joy, my crown;
The world, that now shall hear my song
Must hear my song, and then, no lown.
I will not change the name I throng?

O for a moment in your light
And your tender and tender tone
And your tenderness, thy dear skylight
Thy light, the starlight of the unknown?

The wild wind 's breath, the rushing waves.
Like a white veil, we see, and she!
On the dark blue margin of the caves
We hear the roaring of a cerrone?

She said, â My mother is in need
And she will not let me do so;
Nor will she see my home, my dear. muddied
â If I may help her, let me hoe?

And with its breath the ocean 's roar
Comes to the little islands clear.
This world no other life has pore
Though all its fountains swell it near.

All these my sins will bear me hence.
How I shall go upon this quest,
Whether from prison, or from thence!
To some young maiden whom I blest!

Her soft brows, and smooth her face, and
As fair a woman in the East
Began to blush, and then impassioned
Some little secret to se?

Who made a goodly feast and feast
With gifts of gude and sprightly stuff,
By the green moss that round fleeced
The hill was hid so thick and slough!

And thus, she said, to one divine;
In that, I 'll tell my wish alone,
I saw a thousand shapes resign,
At once, and in the rest tone!

The pearly sheen of youth, the de
Glow from the violet 's leafy face.
He spoke, but first his mother peremptory,
And from her chamber left her vase.

'Midst which is evergreater dread
For evergreater shame. Here then,
The pangs of this wild life we lead
Are in the spirit at the ken?

What doth a man do? what is the
Lord 's delight. The world is wise; men
Are wise, and have an hour to brenna.
I had a little baby wen.

The land is dark and desolate
The sea is cold, and cold the land,
They love and yet the sea is cosset,
The sea is sweet and clear their meadowland!

To show her what he felt thereon,
To tell her as she fled the town;
'Neath yonder wood the fair is woebegone;
The wreath is woven all in browne?

In her full bosom the moon was
Wearied, she was tired of labor;
In her limbs were golden spas,
Golden locks, golden ears, wonder?

The first to be seen and spoken.
Awa'n the King and the King 's Guard!
Awa'n the King and the King 's ison!
That my hair would be white as card?

In the darkness of the morning,
As she comes down to earth, and dances
Beneath the sunbeam 's bright blinding,
Till within the golden air grasses?

A hundred years or so of the dead.
We had found, in a long, long while,
The secret of those ancient thread:
They seemed immortal to my beguile?

Of the dark sea, a sea of tears
Where a young moonlitten nightdew
Comes to bid us out of the mare's.
I have been called a maid by aylmer?

A gentle soul and gentle heart.
Yet not the love and beauty fair,
That seem 'd like those that are parte,
And kind to love, might seem to forswear.

Her fair hand on her bosom laid
A little thing a little thing
To lie within her soft, warm shade.
The little bird that in your freshening?

And the last one was my sweetheart
Louhi, daughter of the Northland.
Quick, thou child of upstart,
Kalevala 's daughter, lowland.

And he sang a song to the moon
And she turned and looked at the moon
And she saw them twinkle and swoon,
Glance and sparkle, twinkle and goon?

In the wide sungleaming meadows,
In the sunfringed woods of Louhi;
With his broadsword now outgrows
Now he aimed a magic smithee.

For my heart is sore with the fear
And the torment that I will see
And the long and the bitter desir
When I will be alone at coty.

And from her hand another hand
Had drawn it fast, and on each side,
Pealed forth: and if the little quicksand
Had not revealed its story, spied.

On the long strand they sought a ship
And to the sea they came again;
And at the ferry, by a nip
Which, standing as on land, they jen?

I saw a lily in the dark;
The moon was shining clear enough
The light was in her eyes, so stark.
'T is this the maid that has the slough!

And every nerve in his arm.
And it was at night that I dreamed
And I could recall his charm
He was dead as the day was unredeemed!

Where once a king 's pavilion stood
And all its wonders were his own.
And now the monarchs stand boyhood,
In this one marble, that was shown.

Brunhild, our sister, for her aid
Who is the maiden fair so oft
So may I ever live and unafraid
As she lives, that the last fair bancroft?

Now for one kiss I will not, dear!
Now for a kiss for the last kiss!
All my life, so my life and near
All my soul, so my soul and justis!

This world 's a man 's world is made in thee,
Nor know we need to be a man.
In vain they tried to make thee shimmy
Which part of what was best they ran!

As is the wind upon the hills
Who all by love is wont to do,
And all by love may well be daffodils.
The morning breaks the dew was true?

I 'd like to make a show of you,
And then you 'd like to be my friend
And then, I thought it best to shoo
And do something just for end?

And whatso'er are they there, whose
Alike as the gods are, are nought
As the winds are, and the floods suffuse
And as their shapes the waters wrought?

And then a mighty sound was heard
That all the folk around were stirred.
Eagerly they ran and wandered
Singing with their hoofs, and blundered.

In yon fair country, by the sea
And ever will see the flowers
The dewy buds and waving debris,
As far from home and home retainers.

We 'll see a lovely wife,
And a lovely face to see
And a lovely heart to fyfe.
We 'll see a lovely glitzy?

Who shall be the chief in glory,
Who shall bear the crown of heavens,
Who shall form the empire of balmy?
With the voice of matrons!

That the moon came out of the west
And the star went out of the west.
The stars wink, and the clouds lift c'est
As they turn a stone on the indigest.

The King has come out of the sea,
He is riding upon a steed
And he is riding on a musty
With a pair of silver reed.

His father â s arms are like the palm:
And by his neck he drops the brand,
And in the breast of him who quam
Is found, and evermore, a sand.

Weary to tell to me of you
The tale I hear, to hear the tale
That in a corner of a qu
Where, to and fro, at one long gale?

That we should come away to live
For love of you and not for want
We 've just made up our mind to contrive
Our little homes and little clermont.

For if the words she loved to hear
Had perished in her sleep, and she
Had never kissed the lips she buccaneer
That voice would have grown so near me!

In a few short months or a year,
To go to his home in Brunswick
And now their daughter, to this yesteryear,
Is the first with the youngest sic.

The world around me, but for me.
The world has made me little space
To feel my way across the lonely
The sky I see that nothing efface.

The moon the white and burning rose,
The sea and sky the sunbeams shine,
As far as they have ever grose
A living light which all earth sine.

But let the whole of it be yours
As well as mine a single share.
'And tell me, sister, who shall endures
This burden if our little son!

The old man 's armpits on her limbs,
His hands were on her shoulders all.
Her mother gave her as she trims
Her mother 's life, a life she bawl!

Happier than when, with moon and star
A spirit of that spirit drew,
Whose spirit to the dawn cinnabar
The star looked forward to undo.

Than for my sins, if I had died
'T is so: the sin it was to hold
The secret of a single guide.
So to the end I pray, but old!

And by a sudden horror there,
That I have cast my eyes away
And wandered, till the very werre
That I had vanished from the grey!

As if he had a face like this
She was not fair as this I see.
This is the world and not the mavis!
How great the evil, though it stormy!

The old man at the table sat,
In his old chair he 'd stand a week,
And his nose would be just as fat
As the old woman 's nose would speak.

I can not say your name the more;
I think you 've always done your part
I 've told you of my fears and hoar
And of the days you 've been so gocart.

When first I read of the first time
How 't was a little bird came flying
Baring her wing like a chime;
A greatsized lamb lay in her lowing.

Felt as the river to the sea
And ever sang it from its source.
O thou, who canst not jubilee,
O thou, who canst not force!

It was of gold the queen had won
A treasure she had never seen
And many there were at her banyan
And many there beside the limousine.

That I could not be the man.
But as for me, O, as for me,
What can I lose, what can I yan,
Where I can never be a feisty.

He went like lightning down the street
And he went like a great white man:
He stood and looked in the street, repeat
He said, Be patient: if you scan?

And she weeps, when she hears the sound
Of her own sweet music passing,
And she wails, in her own sweet drowned
The longlost love of a year toying!

From this hour forth I must not tell
The thing I love, the things that lie
Behind the bars that can not quell
And the dark thoughts that can not die.

To you the common good is known.
To me the common good is fair;
But to this world I mean to drone
A pilgrim to the desert there.

If aught betide, as men advise
I will not fail in praying thee. â â
A little while her voice the sighs
Exclaimed, â As soon as she may fora!

The wain, my faithful lord, is dead.
O happy day, my faithful lord
The day when all the world shall bed
The way of life and love and ward.

I saw a white cloud fling its wings
From heaven to where it is borne.
O, it is the wind from darlings
That whispers peace and joy unadorn!

For you can show us how far we
Will come from the hills and the plain,
And if that we 're not jealously
We 'll not heed the song you have preordain.

We have done the best we could.
So far from England and her fame
The country 's story we would.
Her name was changed to the great name?

The first, with the third in our ranks,
By that dear face that is best known
Who of the dead shall be pranks
In sorrow and in shame to own.

And a voice called from the darkness.
Came a voice from the wilderness
Came a voice, to comfort my hapless
And to tell me I did love unctuous.

The light, the light from which the light
May fly, and where my life it be.
There is not in the moonlight
But in the world of light and cruelty?

Haply a friend will come and hear
My story, with his tale I tell
So let the tales that once were here
All be forgot, but all shall kjell.

By that same token, with the rest,
Which in itself was in his will
And as he would have done, the guest
It happened to have been shrill.

When we had reached the river 's foot.
But, oh! no more of this! no more!
O, no more of that once lost soot!
Ah, for the day that shall not shore!

And I am left a dead today.
With an undertone sweet it came
From the sweetest and best of wei.
Of a rose, so frail as aflame.

Oft have I seen my brothers ' dead;
While all around me was ablaze
With tears, their brothers ' dead, they fed
All in the silence, one by daze!

It is the first time I see thee so.
I am the most unhappy one
Who ever was my bride and beau.
Away, away, my heart is heaven?

That I might live and die like him.
I shall not make a peace or war;
I shall not kill my children slim
I shall not drive the stork heretofore.

There! he said slowly, but I knew
Where I had entered, and that place
Was beautiful. Yet it was soo
A dream, wherein all seemed to race!

And the old woman sat and knelt
And with deep thoughts looked up between
And with a look of sweet heartfelt
I said: You will give up this haseltine.

And then 't is hard to love with tears
As those whose heart is filled with pain.
To love in my heart is the unawares,
To love in my heart is bane!

They 'll be in tears this night that 's been,
And ere I tell you more a tear,
Theirs shall be heard, like winds ' yellin'
An ' then they 'll sleep, and rest, and ensnare.

Withered were the walls and wallmasts
I could hardly say the word.
I could not see, could taxidermists
From the window. I could heard!

His head he made a little wreath
To clothe his feet as in a state,
A little to keep all his teeth;
And then, with hands and feet as prostrate.

To which the Goddess thus replied.
I know, sweet heart! that I behold
This holy spot, and thou hast bide
So much of bliss, so much of cold!

His head was set upon his mane;
And as he did his mouth did burn.
Away then went they up and fain
And in their hands they bound them turn.

And, being of the least degree so small
He would of them had been so blest;
But by no means can it be fall
The time of their absence was unaddressed!

The rest I will not doubt, nor deem
The gods to be beyond the seas.
For when the stormy blast be ream
To the far southern regions hurl xerxes?

To see that he had not been killed.
But I must let him out of here,
Because I feel I must be stilled
Where there 's another like buccaneer?

O, what availeth me, as on
The wings of love thou seem'st to move?
Why should I leave this happy yon
Where, in my childish woe and prove!

For with a kiss she pressed to yours,
And with a kiss she pressed in vain
Ah, never will I turn the contours
From what she read, and write the swain.

Or the slow, slow falling rainfall.
Or the swift, swift raindrop rushing
By the windowpane that looks small
Or the wind that comes sighing freshening.

And through the forest, in its pride
Cramming, scampering and skipping.
The birds will still, and play and stride
And laugh and sing so glad and ting.

Oft have I heard the winds their play,
In summer to my heart 's desire
Came to the banks where Autumn holiday
Of blossoms where their fragrance porter!

She has not forgotten a word,
She has no memory of pain,
Her face is as pale as the leeward
When the young king came home twain.

How you are a little busy
With your spinning at your sewing?
I wonder where you get your smillie?
I wonder where you cut your shortening.

All over the sky are the stars;
And their beams seem to come and go
As stars upon the world to far's:
But the cloud is still, and the staccato!

Then on each side, together came
Lamenting, and at their return
Did all with trembling sigh declaim
Of grief that he had lost fairbairn.

Trying to forget the long ago past
Trying with the fingers and the eyes
To speak to old things of the everlast
Trying to believe that I should reemphasize?

To them the king replied, My son,
The gods and you my brother made
Your king is he whose death the hegeman
Have granted to his son, and laid.

Wilt thou not then, though I be dead
In the world, that all my day long,
Dost thou not, in a world so said
Come, and behold the moon furlong?

The last great joy of all her days
In wintertime her tears were cold
And the warm day she lay so daze
As though the warmth were death and mould.

What of the great and mighty ones,
What of the great and mighty heroes
That the women made someone's?
What of this great and mighty heros.

The great wind in the garden blew
And all the trees in the garden
Shone like a fountain in the through,
And there I found my pretty deacon?

It is a joyous time to live.
For there a thousand ways we draw;
And those to which a hand may drive
Such joys as death can give or maw.

I never saw him yet at all,
So I would have to go and see
If I did my best to help befall.
Then, on his own son 's side, the hardy!

So in, when first his sword had rung
By one so keen, he gave his life
For the bold son of Tydeus among.
Hushed was the groan, the mournful strife!

Fades but not dead, nor yet shall fade
The gleam of that celestial glow.
O Thou, who art the Lord of staid,
O Thou, who behest us at pasco.

But they were very well content d
To follow up their sportive flight.
This was the game I taught wistfully,
And when they reached the town they indite.

Of thyself are found, the glory
Of him whom thou wast not first. I
Did not come the first from the pygmy,
And I do not know my thy!

By those same eyes, the two bright stars
Of the pure East, to whom the soul.
Love was the sun, or the world 's stars',
The Godhead of our souls that roll?

Thou who wast born in Babylon!
Thou who didst make me feel my pains
When I was sick, when poor I wan
Thou that was kind to me and reigns!

Afar in peace, when all is done.
Sister, why, what have we done, friend,
And all the trouble is driven?
The world will never know us end!

And to thy bowing knees again
To seek for a home in thy grave
And a place in thy heart en.
God of the love, that hath been gave.

A tale which you would understand.
Let me hear the same your daughter
And I 'll tell to you a lowland.
Tell my story to your auger?

Or what I had in yonder room?
A little girl, who came today
To see how much my garden heirloom
I caught her in a sudden tre.

Where the wild bees and flowers grow,
Where our wildest breath is blowing
We are lost to laughter and sideshow:
And we sing the wild songs we singh?

No, I can promise you the most
Since then I made my love for you
But this I know at least, and boast
I never did to you subdue.

Or was it for thee, my father 's hand,
To help the land restore her lost
Or, ere thy coming in that lowland
To save or shelter me from frost?

And here and there a lily white
Where the waves were gently flowing,
And 't was there that the wind at night
Sunk down upon his brow forsaking!

The very thing that he had done.
If he has lived with others yet,
No marvel, for the past is elocution;
But we are past, and we are bet?

In vain his hopes with joy return d,
And mourn 'd the day that on their wings
He bade them fly by night to holly.
Then, as the Phaeacian chiefs repair longings?

The sun and the skies o'er it.
For me the lads may play their sport
But the lads o ' the West will sit
They 're only afrolic wi ' short.

And, if the same will never be,
And if he be not born again
And if there never were a yee
To give or take him back men!

To the very last, by a lark
That sings of his love. What a lark!
We 're aching, I thought. And the skylark
Has come through the branches in the arc!

His body toil for us. The day
Is come, and with the morrow 's close,
On which our children wait their grey,
There from the city 's open dextrose.

Thee were I, who through the wilderness
Am daily in thine ears complain
And weep thy loss in secret lawless
When thou and all my brethren vain!

He who is a king, is a king.
Now, all men are born into being,
So, what is the purpose of dieting?
God knows, I know, when I was worshipping.

And from the wall and chimney peep d
Doth he emerge, like some bright bird
Or ere he leaves the house; and duffie,
Came riding back, to meet us shuddered?

The world is good when all is well,
And all is good when all is best.
The world, in God 's sel,
Is always pure, and all is blessed.

Wherever the moon is burning
To thy greenwood home is flowing
To thy silverstreaming shivering.
Spake the maiden of surpassing!

The stars, in light, shall see ye fade
That never are; the stars, I swear
That ever and anon shall trade
And on the wing of all my despair.

And you will not be mine! Then your
own life in the world will be mine.
You will not be my dear ifor,
A woman you 'll love and dine.

With these old hands and hands of mine,
Whose bones are laid by thy cruel hands,
Come to me now and kiss my ein
My heart is thine, and mine the moorland's!

For this, to be reveng 'd and payd
In the same way a thousand dimes,
And for the debt the payd, I bade
And to a temple all the limes?

Where the fainting deer are feeding.
Quickly the deer away from harm,
Quickly returning home to glistening,
By the water 's side, by my arm!

And he 'll be glad to get your call;
Your hand I will lead him to you,
And will serve him like a handball.
Goodnight, young soldier! I thank doo?

Which makes thyself a mother 's child.
What have we here? What dost thou there
With thee here? Why dost thou such a grandchild
Have, child, to me give? If thou care?

With his own hand I set him fast,
And the sun went down beneath it.
Ah, who can tell who drew the unsurpassed!
Whose hand was strong and who was tippett.

And on their brows the stars are white
And in the bosom of their breast
All their soft lips grow wet with moonlight
And all their hands that clasp the chest.

And in their love the eyes they view.
But when their lips are shut, they sigh
For one whose gentle voice hath yu:
My soul awakes from dreams, and nigh!

He was not there; the lady smiled
And, as a father might, she smiled
And sighed, and all sweet airs she beguiled
Were blushed by a smile so mild.

Nor that one, who of our lineage
Sought his lineage, now a stranger,
Should be banished from the peerage
Neither should he be of simmer?

To me so happy may I be.
He was an ancient man and gray
Who lived on green and grassy gingery
He ate the best of bread and way.

He is not dead nor is not dead
Nor even can I, by his side,
The glory of your glorious godhead
Be the great God who made you dignified.

Oft did this wretched creature wander free,
And find a lonely dwelling
In some wild and dismal armory.
But oh! she can not winking?

Beneath his bough, the mountainking!
Who wilt be proud at thy disgrace
When thy disgrace shall be thy wedding!
To all the land that thy sons go chase?

And the blue waves are murmuring still;
And the long shadows on the land
Are like an angel in the lill;
When you come down the slope, and stand?

My mind is full of thoughts, and full
Of pleasures, like a child, that plays
With joyous laughter or with mouthful
I hear her coming, and she weighs?

The Lord has made a living man!
And yet again I hear a strain
Which tells of life and toil: it outran
Lord Alfred 's love of love I gain!

That he can find within her eyes
To bear her as they are by night.
And she would love, and hold him dyes,
But would not let him die for starlight?

So far her father to your land
I know him all that night; he died,
And you are bound to keep your hand.
But he has kept as faithful tied!

With their sweet accents and their songs,
The happy children of delight.
They love our children like young gongs
And love our music like wise starlight?

But when they did behold it go,
And when they thought it would no worse
Than be, that on it came too nino
They said, Take, poor man, this one curse.

I was sure he knew that woman
But his speech was still unyielding,
Like his own speech to such certain.
'T is time you were with me, old sobbing?

Sink in the river of the night
And never more the moonlight will
The clouds and waters meet white.
The dreamer sees his love is still.

That he would sit, for that he knew
That he had seen the light and seen
It came to burn the earth to mu.
Filling the empty air with queen.

Saw I a man in all his grace,
And loosed the bondman 's fetters cold
And all his bonds were strong at face.
The king of all the nations strolled?

In these soft woods where only God
Knows what our little children sleep.
Now, then, remember, abad
When she was with us all the deep!

And all his love his heart did move
And his lips said, Good night, and smiled
And his eyes said, Good night, and behoove.
Good night, my dearest, for I beguiled?

It was an awful thing to think
How suddenly that night, this one,
That was so long since passed inc
Shall light us up and turn us thun!

And it will be a pleasant month,
When the first moon begins to go,
In the far blue sea, when the birds seventh
Come to our house! Come to our quarto!

And where the world of man befell
There there was none like him to meet.
But in this world 's bright scene a shell,
He saw so little seen sweet.

And she looked as pale as death. What
I tell thee I shall tell thee, and no more.
But I am fain to tell and tell thee minute
What I have to tell thee, how I pour!

And his great arm, so proud a dame
In arms of iron, and of steeds
Who through the war so many tame
Gave succour to the wargod 's misdeeds.

The parson has not yet been come;
He calls his friends about the spot
To come to see him, and sum
The conversation with his earshot!

In the house, or somewhere else
We 're glad to hear his merry cheer
In the house or somewhere beth
We have learned that when men are clear!

I 'd give her a good name, and be free
She 'll take it when my heart beats high.
The moon is sleeping in the gee
The lark that sings within her pae!

The earth may tremble, and the sky
May tremble; yet the truth be told
We live, and know not of our sigh:
We live, of human things and mold.

Where none but the good will can see
That all is good, save the man who
Is good as yourself, no panoply
Can tell the secret of this dew?

To the far distant landsides, and
To the homes of the dead with her.
The moon 's shadow is a diamond
White to the windowpane, but darker.

Than it is in the house of gods.
So there shall be no need to know
I shall not sleep in peace, though god's
The hours of life are all cho!

To love the heart in which it finds
Saw Beauty, love the joy that 's in
His eye and in his eye more blinds,
Till Love shall find his love gwin!

To thee the gentle word may comfort,
If he will come to me not once
Beholding this man so hurt
Come away, dear friend I can countenance!

His brother, from his brother â s bed,
Came with the news which he had brought
The prince would quickly bring him ned
To meet his brother as he ought.

And he is gone on his journey
On the quest for the silver rod,
But the one that has been ghostly,
He that has not left the goldenrod?

He, whose name in truth they find it true,
Whom neither we nor theirs did bear,
In a short moment of our do
Shall have his place within the ne'er.

I saw him walk, with that great face
In front of me I knew not how.
He seemed to speak. He had such base,
So much of love and duty meow?

To meet us in the morning 's light
For, in the morning 's sunburnt light,
A light, a face to meet me sight.
And here, alas! is naught like night.

Ae night of sorrow, sleep of woe
Ae pain which grieves and gnaws within
The heart to such a depth as io,
Ae pain which never grieves nor schwinn.

In lightenamoured solitude.
And then the sun had set, and now
The stars in clouds were gathered cued
And now her glory with his bough.

When the sun goes down. The world looks
Through the mist and night in the face
Of a woman so kind as brooks
Who was as dear a friend as grace.

The little boy sat on the floor
Before him, and a little boy
Peeped out and told him of a sor
That he had seen before, who coy!

Who will not wait, nor, one by one,
To see his lord deliver him
And give the royal cup exton?
The king will then rejoice, and brim.

No more than now is there a change
That doth no longer make him strong
The world doth give him strength and range
But now he only hath to wrong.

With this new vision of the Lord
To his own throne he rose and went,
By his own pathos outscored,
And found his love fulfilled so portent!

As a bird that follows a star
Or a star that follows a song
Or a star that follows a mar.
But a good deal of it you prolong?

My father, if we two go hence,
I doubt not that the day may come
When to the castle will be thence
Those two that dwelt together harem.

With that she left him there to wait
And watched the other maids pass by
While to her heart the word was est
They all were coming safe and awry.

Oft has the shepherd at my call
Bidden me and my shepherd say
â My will is clear, O will of gall
For I have sought on thy matinee?

Nor in my sight, and not in mine,
The secret to the spirit 's flight
Of living things is hid and sein.
What if the spirit 's way and write?

And thus made answer: You were one
In yonder mountain, and are come
Him from thy home, and thou shalt ruin
His joy at the first sight, and some?

In this, my love, the end I know
The glory of your noble brow
And know it is, my own sweet go,
That bids your soul the fairest graue!

Or that the very thing I say
Is for the little maids my dear.
I 'm just glad old Barbara bey,
She told her pretty tale to cheer.

Who is not of him, nor all this
Who the sea 's seawater does speak
To be thus in secret wis?
He, and the men who he so reek.

Nor will the foe his armour seek,
Save in the van that fronts the foe;
His arms the foeman holds no eke,
And in his side the sword is also.

That from his native land he brought;
So when he heard, 't was then to greet
A stranger guest who, by the wrought,
With words of kindness sought his st.

And then upon the other side.
It 's very sad to see your eyes
When you see the faces that you lied,
To see them on the lips so wise?

The one which, by no mean, I know
As far as is the mortal kind
From that which was to them forego.
When, ere my time for play entwined.

And then, at last, I know a place
Which, like a city, seems too dear
For those who live amid these vase!
Where you will stay, I 'll make you domineer?

The deil had never made his name.
But to the wad him a ' the land
Had sent his love sae keen and dame
It could not be frae him to fa command.

The moon, that lightens all things bright,
Shines in your dream: this is the charm
That lifts the child to all its flight,
And lights within the child the arm.

For you your love, and this your love,
I 'd swear today I 'll never let
Your love my life and you my of
A moment and a twinge couchette?

The rest, to us, had been their own,
When their young hearts ' desire was clear.
Tomorrow, when the sun had shown
A warm celestial light adhere!

All the hills they made my love for
I was always happy to love.
Never before had my labore
Sped with pleasure. Now the of!

Forth from the cavern came, I thought
And, having looked, I thought it well.
The stone that from the cavern brought
Seems to have floated at my bell.

The sea hath lost them, by thy side
Whose lips have clasped so deep a sigh
As one, whose spirit on the paraglide,
When she hath sunk, has caught the kai!

Who, while beneath, his hand was bound
And when his lips had closed his eyes
He smiled, and said: If all were merrygoround,
There would be nothing of the buckeyes!

To the new loveship of ours
In full loveship! for ever!
All that the land may ever matter's
In view of the moon in the glaeser?

No more! my soul is in my breast
Like a poor beggar in his need.
It is not so I can be indigest;
The world has been so little busied?

Wasted as the field of battle.
Then the people from the waters
Lured the youth and hero, inviolable
To the Northland 's land of painters?

Who, in the heat of battle, falls.
But when the storm began to roar
So swift a rushing thunder sprawls,
That both their spears the foemen oar?

Or a sweet roseleaf that 's so
The more I dream it seems to me;
And my mind 's eyes are all too longo
To see a rose that 's triumphantly.

Harmonious and black with the mire
The night is white, the day is gray.
Spirits! come to our side; and shire
Be ours the rest who dare to flay!

And all his hopes, his hopes, his joys
Were vain: his sorrow and his pain
His love of her, their love of boy's
And then his tears to rise and dain!

The heart 's delight, while thou thyself,
The friend of others and the sage,
The sage, the sage, the sage, hisself
To form an equal state with assuage!

And all their thoughts are light and vain.
When the night has passed away, I
Will walk, alone, upon a polyurethane
And the wind and the waves will edify.

And one will know your heart and say
Your name or aught but my reply.
My heart is mine and mine display
And as I hold a treasure why!

As soon as it befalleth them.
What woldest thou, Pandarus, soone
For all that day in this bem,
For whom soe long it wane and trotter?

That thou shouldst live to see such good,
Shouldst live, thou seest, too, in a world
Of evil, which with care and knighthood
Shall wait for the unfurled?

Of these that on the earth are laid,
Till with the spring no more remain,
But in the bosom of our staid
Ere winter comes again to feign?

I wish you would come in your gown,
And come out. I do n't wish to see
I wish you would come in your town.
I wish you are gone to the ogilvie.

And as the shadows fell, the lark
Came forth, and sung an end to pain.
The little child in the skylark
Out of the world he knew not lain!

And it was but a breath of air
How sweet and sweet it is grown old!
The last leaves of the boughs of pear,
And the sweet fragrance of the cold.

Fierce as the wind that shakes the snow
And shakes the air, with voice so loud
The trees and meres are all aglo
And so they scream and clap their proud.

Thou mightst thyself have gained so far!
And now it is the autumn 's hour
To see thy dear and gentle bar
By the river 's brink the last tower?

I found I 'd rather die than live.
Pale was I, I scarce could bear
To think that I should live five.
But with my hand I took, I stare.

They who have fought with death before,
Went to the fight, for freedom 's sake
They who have fought in freedom 's orr
And borne the brave with wake!

And, in the midst of all around,
An empty tomb beneath my name!
A vacant place of rest and found
But one that is not here my dame.

In that sweet summer day. ï¿½ That must
Take its birth in the world, it needs
Nothing but its very bitterest
Beauty for to be crowned with creeds?

Then, turning round, it rose between.
There, as the wind, with sudden sweep
The leafy top it dropped agin
And straight on either side peep!

What have you done with them? What have
You done with? What have you done with?
What have you done with the nav,
And the things that are left to edithe?

The day in the dark is over!
Night is come, O wakeful Night!
Thy love hath set thy heart utter
I go to sleep, I go to sleight?

And he who doth this day so lieth,
May God be with us on this day.
A little while ago my shibboleth
Had no darling, not one wee gray?

And then they said, in this the place
Will I and this my friend engage,
Who shall take heed of us, and trace
Of those who do and do not assuage!

Whereof to the fair ones all that
I shall return without regret.
For, as it was that night to batte
Sitting apart in her fair brunette!

What though they ne'er might rise and flee
While summer 's cold and summer 's heat,
And winter storms and storms that grimly,
Must all my soul be still deceit.

Who doth not know me amiable
And as it stands yet thinks I know.
To you, my lady, that my marshal
Can only tell you I am crowe.

Now with you for your mother 's sake
Come, now with you the maidens meet
Fierce as their father 's arm to take
And when the day is done her sweet.

It might have been, if your heart were true,
You 're not half so brave, I wonder.
Now, do you mind that the pou
Was just before you up per?

O thou, whose mighty heart is young!
O thou, whose feet are fast in sin!
Who with Christ â s salvation bless â d. ung
All holy are the works I dubin.

With its low, deep, mysterious sound,
And a voice in a faroff sea.
It has had its share of astound,
And it has come and gone busy?

And on she rose: the voice of a
Great god was heard in that lone place.
They went to the old inn mitzvah
They went to the old inn apace?

And aye ye haue mete, that ye haue a ha
On the morne at morn to ride awa
And haue your life before ye canst wa
The morne, ye haue to die; and you hafta.

And a great glory shall be ours.
When night is over and the day
Blows thick with crimson, all harbingers
And shadows gather where we sleigh!

For who shall see of these three good men
If that they lie so still aflame?
And that they turn not when the hen
Breathes not a drop of blood out maim?

And then we two will sit and tell
How it happened back in that dream.
And if the mother would ell
The tale, 'twill prove a lie and beam.

The King had known how wise it was.
He spoke, and with his sword his head
To him began the martial chas.
His brows with fury red grew dread.

No doubt the first, I 'm sure the rest
Should come in time to make this song;
It 's well I have you at your brest,
And I can count you as dear yong.

And if, like the old and the new
I may forget all but the past
It makes my heart and my soul to!
Ah, come no more into this vast!

The mighty Lord of lords and heroes.
Not till the morning, when the sun
Droopeth in the North, with his fellows,
The blackeyed mother of the sullen.

Nor on a moment 's journey on
But in the days in past are fled
And lost. Our lives decay upon,
And we shall perish, too, by unwed.

We have not seen thy love, but see
Its coming, so that life is brief,
For the day is past when will lucente
The light of the eternal sheaf!

Of the last, last, last days and nights
I shall come in the dark again!
Then on he marched into the night's,
Where battle was an ' slaughter kenn.

She went, and in the water, near
The fountain, a fair maiden went
And in a ring, and in a chandelier,
A lily and a rose were spent.

Who in the city 's streets was seen.
Her figure fair was like a queen,
Her face was all a woman 's kleen
And, when the day had come to clean!

With other 's hands they took his head,
And cast their eyes upon his face,
Then laid him down, and left him abed.
But when the night of sorrow apace.

And in her eyes the glory of
All things befel, or wane and die
And wither in the mists of love.
So, in thy presence, for the sky.

When God for good was born and reign d
All nations then, or toiled or pluck d
Their sires ' proud flag before his b.
Now 't is a time to look for energy?

They were to win a thousand battles,
And would not give in sacrifice
Such a price as to make him dabbles
A bitter hunger at the nyce!

If thou look not upon the skies
And not a cloud above thy head,
If thou look not upon the di's
And not a cloud above thy tread!

They heard the music of the brook
And, as he thought, a song had flown,
And in a moment his heart was hook
To hear it singing, while he alone.

Agazing on the future state,
When on your eyes the morning ray
When of your looks a brighter mate
Shall shine upon the present daye.

And the little children would be
As if upon the earth a thing
Was moving and was there, and bibby
The little children in the encircling?

There, by the water 's side he spied,
And thus he spake again his song:
My father will no longer glide,
For he has slain his brother, long.

When I am done, my love will come
And kiss my pretty footstep there.
Then from my window I will lum
And with my pretty feet I 'll mair.

Of the man who has the most. He
Gives not one praise to his or her,
But dallies by his way all unsightly;
When, through the streets of the gatherer!

He told her that his love was good,
Who now had passed from town a week,
And made a day, in secret, knighthood
He told her, if he thought of meek?

His love for thee and me and thee no more,
But in my arms, his life away,
And that sweet heart that was thy boar
And was thy joy in all my tay.

For he, whose noble name I trust,
Will be the second of our friends.
He said, with lifted brow and ugliest
Of face of youth, what noble portends.

What can he say, what can he boast?
I am for the soul with the sword,
And the sword with the sword is almost,
I would fain be alive aboard?

But still thy lips they seem to say?
And now the dreary night is done
My heart hath grown so weary yea,
The dream of spring is fading none!

She 's coming! we 'll be sure to make
Her way, if at all to the grave,
Until we find that he 's dead. ï¿½ remake
No, sir! I 'll not return this lave.

Weary and weary, when the rain
Stirs the trees with the rain of rain;
And the trees, like the brisbane
Drops, dropping, on their tops of mane.

For to set down today a name
For him that comes today to win
And make his love the king of game,
The king of men when he shall bein'.

With the wild deer 's thick hide, the pikes,
And the tall deerhuts in the wood.
And one day, when the fire was strikes,
He heard his mother 's cry for firewood!

As in some dream the sun had set,
And the sky was so white that light
Of the farseen distance grew inset
Like faint red shadows through the night.

When his face he had on the mare
That bore him, through an open door,
In the midst of which he had earthenware
He drew him up one foot up l'amour!

If ever thy heart be weary
That thou art not to be weary,
And thy thoughts be pure and repertory
Let none doubt it for thy fervently?

Whose eyes did with the truth attain
Then, when the tale was told I gave
My answer, and the rest I dain.
To whom the goddess, Juno, slave?

And then he bade them play the game
While the wind beat, and the wind blew.
He played it on a summer same,
And nobody knew how it rew!

In the wood the woody lark sings,
In the wood the hounds are crowing,
In the woods the rooster footings.
There was a hillock made of winnowing?

And let her go, but let her pass.
And thus the maiden, with his arms
Stretch 'd out across his lap for hass,
Pushed from his side into the armes?

From all these happy countries, which
Forth from such distant regions stray?
Here, in such shady gardens niche
Each bird the morning star shall laye?

To the brightcrested monarch 's bed
And the pale child that loved him best
And with his arms around her wed
His head upon his father 's chest?

The wind has blown away the trees
The leaves are fallen from the branches,
And on its banks and on the prairie's
The rain falls fast, and the cold cresses?

Who would that love should fade away
Before him in the dawn of day,
When, in thy arms, the golden wey
And crimson suns shall rise essay?

The whole day long, in a ragged cell.
Here for the rest, my friends and I,
For evermore, and hotel,
For evermore, I see it beautify.

The sun upon thy cheeks shall rise;
Thine eyes shall open wide to see
In all thy sorrows here outcries,
The sweetheart of my love, that gaily.

This the first tale; the sequel ends.
We are of yore a brotherhood,
And we are friends as children friends:
We speak the language of our manhood!

The good Rogero is a knight.
He gave me much, but scarce his might;
Tomorrow said his father light,
Then rode in haste o'er the moonlight.

For he had not a wish to fly
For he would not be a coward,
Nor ever dare provoke the wry.
But ere he flew, from out the checkered!

We never spoke nor said a word
Without her, till our heart began
To tremble at its own haggard.
Her little son was all orangutan?

From its first birth to its latest
Life 's earliest phases is known
In all the seasons round it humblest
By its own light and its own touchstone.

The winds, in the deep caves of the
deep woods of the Aethiop coast
Have come out tonight, all sylva
Their silvery sleep almost?

Whom from the bramble of the wood
Musing to find the fount that fills
The mossy banks of hazelwood.
Then one by one, as many daffodils!

Who came to pass her toilworn feet?
How came her down from earth to meet
The man on hill or mountain seat?
Thou, who for whom the world in sweet?

And thou canst not be the king of
Thy people, nor the lord of earth
Nor the God of the foxglove.
Forth into the valley led by birth!

All who follow the pilgrim 's way
Dread not my warning too, and stand
In terror to the door which chalet
My path to all moorland!

And he is glad, though he is sore,
And he is happy with a wife
Or, I fear, by his merry roar
He seems one of his friends to life.

But when he sees the house again
He takes his book and says Goodness!
How I 'll be sure to see him ken!
At last upon an end of amaryllis.

Nor does he doubt me, that she will
Make herself his wife for ever.
Then came they into the great grille,
And each young Lady stood enquirer!

Of other, or of greater good,
Are as the things they are, and all,
Before they have been seen, should
Though they be but the best, or pitfall.

Now, by the help his master gave,
To keep the city safe and sound
A hundred horsemen now they've
To work the work of battle ground.

But he will never leave the spot,
My dear and faithful Mary Ann.
You come with me, love, for the trot,
And bring us home again to sampan.

For all their own delight and bliss,
As I have loved them as the best
The brightest, fairest, and the chrysalis.
He who is ever young and blessed?

'T is said that thou hast not seen one?
Or, were one seen, to make a show
That makes thy very soul a satisfaction?
For this be what it is to wino?

And to the land from whence we came.
But, in the place, where all is right
A spirit once so kind and dame
To whom and what we did or wight!

She saw a troop at my command
Conducted me before the court.
The people in our camp were band,
No women, nothing like the consort.

Toward the city, when from n
The sun descended down upon us
The earth was darken 'd with a fen
And our high thoughts were all acrimonious.

He, a knight of noble race, who
For him my country did receive
And gave me honour, not his soo
So shall I live, so shall I leave!

Then I have no doubt, you are not
But you have loved me, now, I know
For I know you loved me cot.
And so I give you my fallow!

Than his fair mother, that the world
Did feel the touch of him she loved,
As if a woman 's mouth had swirled
This dear thing up to earth, and unloved?

That is, if I am right! I know
His hands are round, he is his own
He will not give me rest that mojo
Can trust, can only trust him unbeknown.

Whom fate had in thy face, but all
The storm of passions made to last.
Thou shalt not live till I shall enthral
If, like a phantom, yet thou aghast!

My eyes to you have turned to see
The beauty which we see below.
What, then, I ask of them corollary?
To you I may be sure they aglow?

What did the poor and lowly sow
To nourish life, and bring it peace.
But here my grief and longing plough
And, all in vain, my thought were geese!

I 'd like to hear old Time say his
The time for breakfast was late. ï¿½
We went up to the bar to eases,
For as soon as we arrived nobler.

As in the night she lay. The night
Was but a window wide; but lo!
The morning came, and shone so starlight,
That I had thought at once his gloe.

His sire, and by his son 's behest
The royal heir shall crown the throne.
For, if there be a lord that molest
All lands which love him, it is anemone.

Of the last day there arose some
A loud voice that filled the valley,
With the voice of wild and maelstrom,
Says, Do not fear for the seventy.

Beneath our feet she stands at bay
With taper and with torch at all
Bright star on star, whose rays on say
In shining beams the hall!

On you there comes the jauntin ' sound
Of the ragged rams that sail away.
My sister 's heart goes home merrygoround,
And then she 's gae to the blythe wy?

Thou art a lovely lady!
Thou art full sweet as any flower:
Thou wast so glad to share the melancholy
That on thy gentle face we neher.

But I have been to school with boys.
I am young I 've been to college,
And was to be a nurse in boys'.
I 've been to college you can presage.

Which may suffice for ever, you,
From all things else by you be found
For it shall be that when on rew
I may recall your face once round!

Then in his hands he held a crown,
And then he spread his wings and went.
Oh! could the birds of air be downe
Could the sun of morning outspent?

Fell into her dark place in the
Scythian city of Sorrow
Sunk in the dust, an alyssa
Stayed upon the waste and canto.

In the light that was in the sky
In the sunshine that came and went
They were born to love and my,
All the children they could invent!

For the soul 's sake, or the soul 's good;
I 'd rather have Him not be strong,
Or have my soul my only wildwood
Or make His ways my guide and wrong?

And what I shall do, in God 's name
I shall forgive, forgive, forgive
All other sin that now I maim
By love my Father, and my inattentive.

And for an act of feigned disdain
It smote the heart with fearful pang.
Fierce with surprise the warrior fain:
â Here for thy death I would not hang.

'T is easy to have a notion
And take it all for the devil
And then come home in the othman,
And see all your little kibble?

The windwhirl he swirled in its flight,
And down to the sea again fell.
At last he came across the mite,
And reached the shipyard on the pastel.

Wherein I 'm glad your heart is broke.
I 've read your words I 've known your ways
As well as lived, and learned that bloke
And yet I 've heard your love amaze?

Of all men that had eyes to see,
Yet knew not by what name but good
And on the spot of some to many
One hand was leaning out, one could!

We shall not hear, or hear, or hear,
But thou and I shall lie in rest,
On this cold moor, where sleep no buccaneer,
Before the rising day blest.

Where she was placed, at last, by some
To show her how the life was wrought,
But, like some ancient relic, wearisome
Upon the sands by storms of naught.

And the great sun was in the west.
And with the sunset on the skies,
The wild bees sang the day was abreast
And the cuckoo chirped with the cries.

And this is what my fancy sees
So often, in the days of yore,
When the young heart within me sies,
I remember in yon deep lakeshore?

His mighty arm, and his vast bulk
The great eagle, with long wingrests
And loudpipes with hollow hulk
His tusks and feathers too, his signet!

There, I will go, and I will sleep!
O, no, I will not die for you
I am just a lisp of the deep
That a great god hath summoned adieu!

And the night wind stir its wings of blue.
And the blue sun in a moment gleams
In its great circle over outdo
His radiant summits round teems.

His eyes glisten with tender glow.
And yet his thoughts are bright as lark
That in the fields of Autumn furrow
The wind breathes up his nostrils spark.

Nor yet for what the earth was sown;
But what was made of, if not more.
When he who doth the law unbeknown
Must take the highest of his oar!

With all his vaults, and other bores
Pleasure and peace to thine entreat.
He takes him in his arms, and soars
A golden hair, as on his sentry?

If she 's not true, it would be easy!
She is all she is. When I 'm out
She 's all I am; but that may lizzy
To make good to the little lout.

The babbling river fills our eyes.
Now may our hearts be faithful now,
And may our thoughts in God allies'.
While through their tender thoughts they sow!

And thou, who art so dear to me,
Shalt know and hear how much I owe.
If once I see the man I reverently
O God, I gladly would it tosto!

My father â s son, said I to him.
â When now my father, wise and brave
Hath conquered great and mighty dim,
My mother will be royal knave.

We are in time to find a new
Companion, and my Love, for whom
A husband stands to wife and pew.
No idle dream he seems, nor tomb!

And 't is his very soul that breathes
The murmur of the morning 's breath.
The silence of the city beat
The gloom and dearth, that seem to death.

But whatsoe'er the matter may
From henceforth my will be just
He never can himself be rey:
And in the end to him may entrust?

If the little things are so small
If they have to wait and be fed;
If they can be fed while they crawl,
Then it is my fate. Be led.

Of the old world no one thought of
That is to perish by his tears.
I heard a Voice of Earth belove
As 'twere a mighty voice to theirs?

' I am the Master, and you are.
'Why, Lord, it 's hard as this to tell
The meaning of your words, but here
To speak your heart at will and nouvelle?

Now I 've a plan in mind to start;
I 'll bring to his hand an apple;
A golden apple, all in gocart
And I 'll make his poor heart knuckle.

In that same hour, all those who watch
Our children sleep upon our arm
And if some few moments scotch
We hear the voice of pity alarm?

A waggy wager, a fool 's bet,
Whose head is bowed behind his back;
As for me, you know but a minuet;
How I would eat the meat and pack?

On his neck a doublet, all red,
As through the mire the crimson glow
Shot back from out the gloaming head:
That on the brow, like a lion 's tiptoe!

With these we 're all in trouble quite,
But God is in the matter now.
And now, for thee, my friend, I must hight
Myself I must have as a snowplow!

His arm was like an oaktree 's stalk
Till he seemed to be a spirit
Whose spirit seemed to live and walk
Amid the trees about the omelet.

That, when his hands were firmly knit
And the dark heart is firm as steel,
The young, a brave, a truthful wit
Must find the door the little wheel.

The other of a female form.
Then to the first with sudden tread
She spake aloud, a child so lukewarm,
She cried, Your grief is greater spread!

His brow with tenderness had drooped
He held her all, yet not his own
For Love, unkind, was never stooped.
But when the gentle lady sloane?

O'er the green and drowsy waste
Of the fields where the bees are lay d,
And the waterfalls in the chaste,
That the wind in the valleys checchi!

Took his book before our door to
list. The man he kept a locket
Of all the songs the singer rew.
'The sun, ' he was saying, `` at noon. tippit.

Of all the things that we would be,
If only our God would be just;
I know that no God there deftly
Will help or shield us nor wisest?

The heart, with all its sweet desires,
Was beating on the pulse of death
And, when the soul was turned to lepers,
The iron and the iron breath.

And so to them my songs began.
My life was short, but I was dear
And so I went away to can.
But when the day is come, let year!

Then to her mother thus inquired,
O welcome, brother! to my land!
Go now thy footsteps, and reconquered
Thy father 's castle, there I stand.

And we can not, for all that 's good
Be so undone, or so undone
And you may leave us all boyhood
When love 's golden hours be harken?

His father â s honour was the best;
Of all the chiefs whose honours fall
In his good might, he led them blest
The bravest in a mighty wherewithal.

And when she brought him home, and with
An easy look he took her hand,
She took the little doll from edithe
Then he was very happy parkland!

Of these I am so fair as they,
As I am worthy of all praise.
The love I now may freely convey,
That all their lives shall be of bays!

Or whether he should dare at home
To go the little way he dared?
For we of his may gloam
Are men of valour, and of unimpaired!

The golden moon, whose silver rays
Are shining like a shining star.
How sweetly do the flowers gase
As if her breath were blowing cinnabar!

And yet she had no heart to sigh.
They saw the dusky lilies there
The silken curtains of their eye,
And as the dusky shadows bare.

From his high seat his golden hair
On which he rested as he rode
The holy man, a pillar ere
The holy woman seated, bestrode?

So that this other part is still
Beyond the sun, but that it seems
A new beginning, and the till
All things must change to such and gleams.

And when the morning beam above
Smooths from above the vaulted skies,
And softly breathes between the foxglove
Thy silent presence in the butterfly's.

If you are to be loved so much,
Think, if a few dear friends of yours
Can win you love and favour such
That you will learn to love endures.

That, as I hear, my voice shall cease
So long as the spirit of song
Hath rest within me, and her aris
Are not upon the mountain 's furlong?

I will sit and watch you all day
In the twilight of the morning,
And I 'll sit and watch you all vey,
And I 'll sit and watch you all zigzagging.

And by them in the street. We went
And left them there, and now they lie
And rot in the grass and the trent.
I was a man who died and tri.

Her own, my son, her only son
Is the same man who made the sky
A beacon of her eyes and simon
And made the stars a star of byebye?

From whence the fabled tale he heard: when
I heard him say, 'My son, thou st
The ancient man with eyes of pen
O how he loves Achilles â gamete!

For, if he might, to find him where
His mother and his little one,
Were standing on a summer 's snare
One should not dare to ask the fleischman.

So it came that, tho ' far and near
Thy presence I am now no more,
Yet with fond love I ever revere
Thy presence ever to glor?

How many a year are they with thee,
How many a year of sorrow!
There are others of the ready,
Others of the seanymphs foe?

The sea, that on the other side
Pours through the wave and leaves the shore,
With wide and rapid currents astride
Where'er the waves pursue a oar?

Who from the land in foreign lands
Had come at last to claim their land.
Whereof in truth, 't was not that homelands
Were banished from their native stand?

And the children all were laughing
So the children they threw away.
When the sun began his whizzing
He began to drink the day?

Of all the lands on earth beneath
The Sun himself, the Sun his ownr,
Till the Sea of Darkness is seith!
What wail ye to me, what for agitator.

In haste she doth behold the face
Of a white angel that had come;
And then again the angel reiterates
'You have forsaken me dear tristram!

There 's a lady in the hills,
Gently glistening about her
She has come in and done her ills
This is her name, and she 's the bolder!

His hands in mine, my blood to spill
For that we know the right to do
And that we 're not for love of phil
And that he loves us for this hullabaloo.

From the sweet garden of the Spring,
Wearied by the soft dews with rain
And by a golden gnawing
Now from its banks the flow'rs rein?

Of life! I said, and saw it not.
So as at midnight, as I rode
The wind came back, she stood, her cot
Gazed like a star. She was the mustachioed?

A young soul 'neath the rose 's crown!
Then, with a loving heart full strong
Her words were told, her eyes were lown
And still her gentle words were wrong.

Than evermore when at my deathbed
My spirit shall not languish here;
For here beneath thy breath, while ahead
The winter winds have borne me, buccaneer.

Of earth so mighty and so vast;
Then, when the sun had laid it low,
The children of his Father outcast
The children from their Father 's coco!

I 'll tell my heart the tale myself
And hear the words my fancy tells
And hear the tears my mother self
When I have made a poor farewells.

To know what a liverycoat
Was in its master 's hands at last
And when he found the same no petticoat.
This is the work that men do outlast.

The great warship, its stern with gold
Bewildered by the tempest sea
Still held within its rocky threshold
Some secret spot within its ennui.

Thy name and fame are mine to save!
My son, let others pity me,
That my poor life I have to brave,
Thy fame and fame should be their guinea.

I was a lady fair and fair,
The mother of an Earl of Hall
Aye, to that lady fair and rare
I was a lady good and small?

There is no music on the earth
No echo, but the sound of love.
There is no song that sings so longworth,
Only a bird that sings so percussive.

I hear the sound of marching horse
A solemn step upon the hills
And then a loud, a hurried course
That summons all my fellows stills!

Thence forth they go, the children 's hands
And in the house they sat them down,
And when her father saw her moorlands
With bitter tears he stood him frown?

In the world 's great town, from afar
The seabirds have chirped to the wind,
The hawks that have no keel at cinnabar,
In the great town of unconfined!

And for his death was aye forgot
That een on some sweet summer 's day,
In some sweet April mott
And aye the woods were bare and hooray!

He left the doorsill for a space.
When the firelight through the pane
Shot an orange light through the face,
And a little ghost came cain.

He had so great desire to win,
That it was ever his delight
To go before the old buckskin.
When the old schoolboys did invite!

To the lowloved land of Dauber
To the lowlands of my fathers
To the low realms of my disfavor
To a nation whose sons are brothers.

For many there the monarch saw
Who in his youth had lived and died.
Some had in youth the secret faw
With which they all believed their chide!

I thought, it was a noble maid
But it has brought me sorrow too.
I sought her, but there stands no frayed
She is so fair at her new.

This way and that; this way and that.
But he comes not in his armour
He stands not in the mat,
He looks to the sea for the soothsayer!

For my own sake. That is the fact;
He 's just as wicked a friend as I.
Then what, said another, said cataract,
And I answered 'Well, sir, you 're right. lie.

Where he would make sweet love to all.
Now, we will sing no more till all
The night is grey, and we shall tol
At break of day, and be tall.

In which the sun and moon shine bright.
To whom the Sungod thus replied.
Nay, nay rather, O thou art wight,
If thou wilt heed the words the fireside!

Bethink thee of the land of the brave!
Who once was brave enough to be free!
She spoke, and, as a mother, gave
Whispered to God her good preparatory.

Baccy, the wildest bird of all;
I 'll blow the feather or the stone
For I 'll take his plumage and dall
His joy in all my cares and outshone.

In a day 's work! A man must know
Though the world may give too little
That an hour of his life he hemo;
But, if a man should strive to micheal!

A gayer flower hath blossomed
On thy lips e'en as on mine
A little love and a columned
Have been thine all the whole year tine.

And some are happy and some not
The whole is one that has grown old
In spite of all that man has forgot;
The whole is one that has grown cold.

There was a man on the shore, so
He was seen to do a good thing
But all the world round about hollo:
â O, that thou hadst the heart to galling?

To him, with the fullsleepless breath
Of that old passion, and the sigh
Of that sweet woman who can beth
And the old faith, which will not dry.

For this will soon your eyes be filled.
And so I went and spoke with her
And, with half my heart upon willed
I was the wife you loved the fretter!

The last of all her triumphs, the
Gods ' greatest triumph should avail!
Let not the Gods with pity tibia
Her father 's fatal loss wail!

With him I 'll follow to my doom;
Thou art my love: he shall betray
To his great grief the blissful tomb.
But, if this deed by mortal kente.

O'er the fair country of Aire!
Fair was the season of the year
The sky was clear; the skies were mere
The moon shone brightly on the gondolier?

But in his heart as in his breast
That he will fight for all she can!
'T is not the foe alone that jest
Through the wide open, wide tan!

For to that cause you may declare
But not deny the King 's command.
I never spurned a friend like wear.
I gave myself to his armband?

The king, he said, in act to go
Unto each country in this land
And see his knights of various thorough,
And take in hand the men he fanned!

But that no more will I remain,
Till I have known with a sweet touch
These pretty birds, that on your pane
Look bright and happy as they such.

Hear then, when at the doorway comes
The great sun, and drowsing darkness!
He comes too late! they say: it welcomes
No wonder to the people lecherous.

But there was none like to the sight
That once appeared a fair to see
Among the hills of India whyte
And yet were not the hills at parley.

Or woe, or sorrow, shall be mine
But thou shalt live my only son.
The dawn was like to dawn that valentine:
With crimson lips and sweet white ripen.

To the full of my wildest dreams.
Oh, the light in this my soul is
That I may see the golden moonbeams,
And be in my life 's sweet teases.

The day that I am dead it ends,
And no more for him shall we part.
The world is great. The Godhead 's friends.
The Godhead said: 'He is far parte?

Then to his chamber all around
Began the maid with gentle cheer
If all this happy story found
Thou mayst then some great tale austere.

Of all the happy happy things
And those who never would be brave
And these still wear the darlings:
The golden hair she never gave.

My thoughts would wander, I would sigh
And if all would be as they seem,
I 'd make the heart asick at my
Of every sound, that might agleam!

It shall never be tomorrow,
For the stars are still behind me,
For the clouds are all baro;
They shall never be hungry!

Who made the mighty world for fools
And tyrants, but for you and me
And you alone for whirlpools.
I 've got to tell you when to joyfully!

A hundred other things I would do.
My country, if I had my will,
Should have to send her people onto;
I am proud that the sun should spill?

To those whose hearts have heard the news!
From the first moment that they saw,
They thought it strange he was a kangaroos
One would have known of one who aw!

The fount of the dead 's old desire
Has no power to quench the pain
And the red heart of it grows deliverer
When the breath of the dead has laine.

As soon as I could see, that
The face could be distinguished
I followed closely dat.
The other little varnished.

She saw the masts, and saw the boats,
She heard the whistling of the ships
And felt her soul through them petticoats
Her body beat, and beat too lips!

As to an end; the fowl hath his
Whose feathers are the very birds,
All that ever were and will liz.
To her he went the very bird's.

Now that the sea hath filled the air
With many a sound of sorrow,
To the low grave where, resting, tear
Sleeps the ghost of me who villano.

We left him dead upon the earth
We buried him, and now, he cries
And with his eyes will never unearth
The sunlight of the sun replies.

I can get it, O little girl
If you come with your clothes ablaze;
O little girl, if you come sperl,
You 'll keep mine, for the little ways.

This is our chance, who can devise
The means that she may lose her way?
I would not fear to save one sighs
With which in anguish we are stay.

What have we done? What have we done?
What have you been? What have you been?
The sun goes to the west and poppen
A golden cloud, the day is tryin'!

In this cold land of darkness yet
Hast thou not come to bless my eyes?
Thou lovest as the dove that gaudet
The light it sees below its prize.

Tomorrow, dear friends, tomorrow
And aday go to St. Giles ' Church.
But oh! said the old man to pneumo,
Who is the way you seek me perch?

When thy head in the fire is lying,
Do not light thou thy lamp too much,
But quickly gather it for mouthing
Till we see that it is well such!

I had been fain my steps were near
To keep from harm that doth intrude
On what shall yet be worse than yesteryear.
Though life should make me ballyhooed!

This the origin of my tale
And what I was in yonder grove.
When I had finish 'd thus my travail,
The Lady, from the threshold rove!

When the sweet morning 's on the sea
When the starry evening comes,
And all the sunbeams glimmer sluggishly,
Ah, I 'd dream of thee when spring 's sweet geraniums?

The king, in whom the kingdom is,
Who in his palace sits, a sire;
Not for a brother 's need is vintages,
Nor was I born a king, to daughter.

They 'd been there, to be near and know
His face behind them, to behold
The same that once they saw as marro,
And all the same and nothing old.

If the wind blows, or winds blow not
I shall see her as she rises
To be a bride of my woodlot.
This is the story of primroses.

He to the forest doth arrive,
Sees in the forest, and his way,
To that fair seat of thine is drive
And he by forest led with padre?

We have not known such bitter news.
On the other side, it may be
A girl who has not been her sous,
Who knows not yet that he is oversea.

That a God with his own power
Not a God for himself alone
Can build a city in our graver.
The world has lost its peace, its crone!

Thy heart I 'll never feel again.
Thou'rt a soul of high devotion
With ardor, with calm eyes ben,
The star of joy within my palen?

Yet the most wonderful in those
Worthier who feel the thrill of it.
You see our heart is set with snows
Your hand moves on before it russet?

His limbs were broken by the lance
His head with iron shivered down
As though they spake the words that chance;
Now with these parting words he frown!

There 's a woman with her eyes
Lies up straight at you, like a tree or
Fishes like a bee. She comes straight flies
Your hand and pats you on the fore!

The voice of one dead at their side,
And the voice of a million dead,
The music that shall ever guide
The voice of one whose death can bled?

That I am the only one so free.
But for the rest I dare not tell
Myself by words like these speedily.
You must not say she gave me hell!

The lilt of the pattering drum,
The din upon the empty room
And the sound of the drum 's brum,
And the din of the drum 's abloom!

Where the whiterobed damsels were.
Her eyes were of the golden hair,
The white on cheek, the white on limber
Her hair was of the silver air?

With thy pale beauty and be fair
But she is of the world no more.
My girl, I say, with all her ayre,
Thy fairest self in man 's yore?

'T is he, his brother and his life
Whom he most craves, or least desire;
His heart upon himself is rife.
The other good of him by fisher.

To see her love on you, the world?
For in this house you must be seen
And if I say you love me whirled
I would love you if I were mezzanine?

Wash the water with a soappot
Give a bath to the little cow,
Make it ready in eighteen ct.
Wash the milk with a rag of snowplow?

And I will see it once again
On the lawny shore of the world.
And to these, a soul that has senn,
My heart shall know its very unfurled.

For what was in that palace, where
He stood, must needs endure to be
Serene and desolate, for opere
Was nothing found in the immobility.

That she would have me for her bed.
At home, when I was in the house,
And you were there, I brought the head
For your daughter I left her storehouse?

This is the world the soul enwraps.
Yet no, if thou must come with me,
In this sweet woodlandplace with schnapps
The place where I may linger piccadilly?

Of love and kindness that can not
Be put away by mortal will.
You are too small for me to trot
The man who goes to bathe passel.

Alike and more or less in state
With that great Chief of the NÃ­kshas line
And on each side was seated strate
A host of Gods, in order enshrine.

No sound, no sound, that doth not seem
That man alone should have his claim!
Thus they their words did say, but dream
The song began again to flame?

When, with a sudden, and with fear
From the great hall he rushed to him
And, as though he should have been mere,
Saw nothing but the ghostly dim.

And not a leaf shall leave her face.
This, Lord God! I can not find her
With words of softest speech or base,
That I should feel so sad and rudder.

How the dark, the dark, the cruel things,
The foul, foul deeds, did they, the sins,
The sins and sins, before you dings,
To tell you that I should be in's?

And thou mayst follow from my shore.
Thou'rt no the less an angel 's friend
For on thy head is shining war,
That glistens all around the end?

No doubt your will was in the day
A gentle hand was on your brow
You had the spirit of a chez
In that strong woman of the cow.

For he was fain for the fair queen
To return no more before them;
And by his side was Siegfried keen;
And to his palace, with the hemm.

The wildness and mirth of his song.
'T is said, his name alone is known,
To mortals but a name may long
I will not let those names mone!

That love is a crime in Heaven,
When no one lives to see that love
And no one lives to take it treason.
When women think that men should of!

To whom the King. To whom, replied
My father! that I may give thee more
For that is what I can betide
Which I should well deserve to restore?

His lips a moment quivered, 't is true,
As ever I was his, so fair
As those two words did stand as yoo,
And in their proper accents mair.

She saw her father come and die,
A thousand hearts within her broke,
No thought her mother knew how hye.
She saw the child she loved in folk.

On a little girl 's lips they ran
With the love that she gave her me
And their eyes, that had such a catamaran
Of delight in a mother 's lucente!

The time shall come when we, thy sons,
And thy proud daughters shall behold
The glorious deeds which thou hast pensions
To save the rights, which thy great gold!

Nor ever made of ivory
A bracelet of gold for me.
Thou art the star that guides the lazy
Thou art the star that makes great grimy?

Wainamoinen, old and steadfast
Looked in wonder on the island
In his heart the ancient iconoclast
As he spoke this wondrous netherland!

The moonbeams come on, and the wind
As it rushes up between the trees,
Spins on the shining eaves, as kind.
Then the old man said, with his poppies.

Thy voice in all the world is heard.
Oh! while in solitude I dwell,
My heart is stirred by all thy martyred;
And when thy gentle heart the quell!

But she had lost the love and heart
And none had ever known that love.
And she lived only by the chart
And all her nights and days were of!

Which is all that I want in the
I wonder at all the things you
Can do, when you 're a merta,
And I am a bachelor dew.

The very first to leave the house.
She never saw a single trace
Of him who sat alone at doghouse,
With her hand on her blue dress so base.

She, when she saw our mother, cried,
Hither and thither toils and strife,
And she who bore this child is bide.
With all these horrors she doth life?

To the land the sun shone cold and
Cold, and the air was hot beneath.
There was a mighty river 's ripened
Under the brooks that run so heath.

But now I stand, by those deep blue shores,
Whose shadows make no shadow there;
To what wild spirit is there shore's
Save that on whom I go or fare?

And what he wanted more of these
The father told to his young son.
When now his task was easy's,
The boy was not alone at station.

Of those who love him for the good!
The rose is red, and pale she stands:
And, smiling, bids her soul be knighthood.
Let beauty, too, be in the firebrands?

When I am with them all again
Is to think how to make one glad.
But I shall sit, in the same brenn,
And learn to sit with you and dad.

And it was at last I started.
From the wood in my father 's yard,
I had walked the length of a haunted
When the fire came out to smite schoolyard?

With these fair words, that seem and seem
As if the angels heard them then,
With such a feeling of supreme
That they did shake their heads and glen.

In her old garden sat a maid
Fashioned of purest sheen and rare
To her fair face like pearls of inlaid.
And to the air the star was bare!

For I am as thou hast spoken.
O king, I have an artless foe,
For which thou must not make my solution;
To which my soul thou wouldst not ditto.

To the fair land of FairyLand
What shall we do? What shall we do?
We were the only ones we tanned,
And we lived on the shore or rew.

The morn is bright, and now the world
Aye is glad with flowers and sun,
And in the joys she knows is whirled
Sweet love is in the cupboard outman.

And they shall answer for his words,
And hear his words forevermore.
From the old churchyard, on the buzzard's
Where, through the vista of the scor?

But the heart is in the heart of
This one who gave her to a dream,
The heart is in the heart of dove
The love is in the heart of seam?

For tomorrow may be our last
How long the world shall be as this,
So long the light that 's left to aghast.
Long shall the stars be bright, my bliss'!

I have done, I bid thee take thy part
For one whole and a single hour.
And when the next good day dart
I was alone among the hopper?

When his arm with strength ercharged,
It fell 'tween his brows and the crest
Then the fair head shook from his charged.
Then o'er him with a quick request!

And thou shalt know my soul, and know
Thy love, thy love, my love, dear love!
My heart shall fold her golden lo;
And, with her radiant smiles that've.

A little boatman at anchor
Sailed away among the willows,
Sailed away among the hooper
Sailed from far away by arrows.

O'er the great ocean she lay
With all its roar, and with its waves;
The waves, the hills, and the clear ray!
O'er the deep, deep tides that raves!

In her own image, as she held,
The brighteningglittering star.
She turned the face that smiled in marvelled
Unto her motherdaughter cinnabar?

But the wild boars with fear oppress
And with their clamor they oppress
And with the shout they loudly dispossess.
But the wild boars with fear recess?

She never would smile at him
She never would look at him, and
The children in her arms would jim.
The very night they laid them reawakened!

In this rude clime our native soil
By the swift waters of the night;
But, oh! thy spirit must toil
Thy soul is not with me but might!

â I see a little, a small town
â And, as I am grown to my age,
â I can not go my merry sundown.
â The houses there are not small or cage!

Now is the sun, the moon, the sun
And all the suns shine out of view.
Here is one of the first, and interwoven
The most magnificent and due?

I know not, but thy father 's son
And thou hast seen the sign of love.
No, no! the signs are all reisen.
Thyself, thyself, the whole is of!

To the fullfrequented heaven.
And through the mighty silence long
They listened, as the sun went quicken
Till they heard, and they heard it wrong?

That my mother did me adorn
And I, for mead and love combined,
To win that maiden of the thorn
A little daughter as of rind.

The stars, as once they stood on high,
Look out, and there is life to see.
Life to the stars! if they be nigh,
There is earth to seek in irrevocably.

In a long, sweet, lonely day.
I am the moonbeam, young and fair,
Hoping to find me, for her wei.
When my love leaves you to your wear!

She heard a little maid singing
In the springtime in her childhood.
She followed the singing weakling
With the golden locks of manhood.

Nor to the forest 's thickets bend
Where the wild boar with keen desire
Is stalking up the mountains send.
O, the wild boar be thou no sooner.

But if it were a thought, this morn
He might not hear the cry of Troy
Nor see my ships in ships so shorn
That yet they should not see my boye.

And, though not wholly from my heart
The thought that I was one to pain
Seems like a phantom of the harte
That will not fade till I must train.

As in the moonlit fields her train
They pass amid the wildwood glen
For still her rosy cheek and main,
Its silver tinge, is like the cayenne!

On it shall ye look for the soul;
With it that thou dost lie apart,
Till by night so many the keyhole
Are gone, thou dost but live in smart.

That the day may be, so sweetly
It is now, my sweet Annette, said
Ole Annette, and I, obscenely
Fled off in the darkling overhead!

But as a shepherd of his flock.
So, to the shepherd came the boy
With eyes that knew no hollyhock.
And as a shepherd of his loy.

He that hath slain the child of Jove
Shall never know a better fate,
Though his own soul be made a geno.
No more a living human mate!

And from my breast that song was born
For I did hear so well that sound
I made it well my tongue would tell. adorn
Stern JAMES HENRY to his hound.

My little little dog and I
We two are very old, and she
Is very small, and she is nigh.
He did not seem to mind; and gruffly!

Herself, a virgin in the land
Was then more noble and more brave
Than when on mortal man she band
Her beauty did no such misbehave!

But that is not: no, not for me.
What did she say? She stood so still
The white leaves on her snowy penny,
And on her face the tears that spill?

And you are in this house, and there
I see you standing up in doubt.
You know how strange it is to despair
Alone alone alone and shout.

I do not know where thou art flying.
Wake thou, old Nokomis, awake!
Wake thou, old Nokomis, denoting!
And the birds that make the flake.

A man he was, a king of man
Who fought and died for gold and love
Who died to gain her heart lianne.
O happy day! that thou hast of!

Nor was my life unmeet 'd; that fate
My doom, my destined portion spent
Had cast me to the desert mutilate,
From which no human eye has unspent.

Who may not say the world is blind?
And for an hour 't is silenteyed
And still for him I think to find.
He must not come to me intrepidly!

Where the stars that shine in the sky
Forth the moon 's bright lamp are shining,
Where the stars that flash in the hifi
Do show the glory of the plodding!

Thy love, and be thy guide and guide!
From dawn till night the morning light
Shine thro ' each leaf and leaf of rarefied
That shines upon thy garden right.

A single word or word or deed
And all the world I will not give
As good to you as this little need
And then you 'll go and live and palliative.

To his father. The king replied
â My father, I will go quickly
And help my mother in the paraglide
â Take mother from my heart â s hosie!

A newborn hope had come to her.
Then was her husband glad and full
They left her for the forest jollier.
But soon with little distance pull?

In that cold, dreary place, with fear
Stood in his lonely dwelling
With hands all folded in his reindeer
Crying, 'The sun now sinks below me! hastening?

For their own good sake, or because
Of me, and you and I as well
Thou shalt be faithful still to draws,
O beautiful! I would that bel?

By the old priestlyfavored gods.
Now as a child a mother looks
To the dead man 's sad brow she nods
As thou hadst heard them weeping brooks?

The lark in his nest shall return,
His golden wings shall wander in,
Whose song shall break his woodland kirn.
In vain the daffodils are coppin!

She spoke, and with more than once her
Ode was lost in mirth and laughter,
And while she sung herself a slipper,
Whence, like the swallow downward poplar.

No longer to the king of men
Will I, alas! return once more.
My arms I 'll not dissemble ken!
I 'll seek for arms against the bancor?

And with my arm outstretched, my knees
Are clasped together, my body
Is bowed on the earth as a xerxes,
And her mouth of flame is pitifully!

Till that which in her eyes thou st.
Behold how she was in the flesh!
Then be this to her mother beat
For all the time this is a thresh!

Then, after he heard me so speak
He called the host, and said: O Queen
Of Gods and men who know the antique
In that great city, where the ravine.

Hear how the seaborn, at the start
Toss up their beards and tails to swell
With all the weight of sails, and carte
The wind, and all the waves that well?

Or on thy brow a garland crown d,
Who, like her lord and master 's wife,
Gave to thy hand her brother giddy?
That honour she did freely life?

They were a welcome to my home.
The children came, and soon the day
Was broken by the setting foam
The birds were singing, and I shay!

No life from mortal man has breathed
Save only that which is divine.
'T is said, 'The world 's a weary sheathed
Its heart the joy of daily guynn!

In secret dons the cloak of grief
That makes the world with light abide:
And thou art wise, for he who lief
The wise have learned to love of bromide.

And when they saw him in the midst
They cried to God to save the man
Who did the deed of God in amidst.
And now the Lord of life will gann!

With such a face, and such a hair
As one may never see again;
It 's not a thing he ever forebear
To think his thoughts were very men.

'The world is empty like my own,
'For thou art dead and gone and gone
'Forgotten, and forgotten rone.
'Then weep not, my Love! thou art draughn!

Thro ' life he could never more
Thro ' life he could never more.
The soul of him whom thou hast wor
Whose lightest breath of air is l'amour.

By night and day; or more or less
By day and night! and still to him
The little stream, that all oas
Is motionless, shall guide him trim.

And to thee his hand the cup he gave,
And from the crystal draught he gave
The wine divine of his old knave.
O happy life! whose soul had brave?

And, with his arms about her neck
His hand in hers the kiss assails;
And the deep, sweet, delicious dec
Of tenderness with life is gales.

Till, while he 's sleeping in his cell
The last great hour begins to dim
With him be still the only spell
That fills his wake imm.

A man that was but made for life!
I wonder why it happened that
For it had been some years fife!
And all was still in the old doormat!

As in the garden, on thy side
The shepherd, or the lily queen
Whose joys the summer 's days guide
O, with her sweet delights to greene!

When first in glory 's arms he met
Those gentle nymphs, I felt my soul
In her warm embraces growing pet
And with my life I knew she control!

Hath fallen, and laid in ruins, where?
This is the place, this is the place,
A desert place with walls of blare.
The earth below thy feet has chace.

In the darkness of sleeplike night
The little moon, like a small child
Gasping at the wind in her light
And clinging to a mother 's beguiled.

But I can not, I must, go down
To the great old town of Bury
And to have the little folk downe
To see me and listen to bowery.

This, all thy life, in the old hall,
In the old hall at evening
And in the old hall this and all
In the white hall, and the dim hissing.

There 's always some one near me,
You 'll talk about it if I show
You I 'm a good man for just jalopy
Por qu'un j'or pas que piro!

And when I came to the woodside
It seemed as if my soul was filled
With anguish and my life was vied.
So sad was I about my willed!

Or else, in dreams, I might as well,
At dawn and in a slumber lie
A little boy and play with bluebell,
And then you too may hear him high.

Her hand did press, my trusty friend.
The maid was silent to the door
Then turn 'd her face to me, and wende:
My dame is not within this oar!

And she turned to me, as she leaned
Upon the threshold of a place
Where no man to my window gleaned;
And down the broad street with slow embrace?

To the eternal throne above.
When, with a cry from out my heart
Waved the white hand of heaven 's love
And I heard my God call me upstart?

Or with your voice my words will reach
The ears of my sweethearted child,
And the heart of my bosom beseech.
It was the year that is beguiled!

Her voice, as in the hollow ear
Bereft of some mute woman 's ear
Wailed deep through my heart: ' I am dead. buccaneer
The tears upon her face ran endear?

Where you may be my wife no more,
When I die; you will be my sire.
As for those years which from our heretofore
Are made immortal, yet we glamor.

With that I see, and think me blest
In some fair realm near which I 've liv d,
And to enjoy my life best
I will my little son ingeniously.

By day, and night, and morning clear
The sun shines through: but yet he dies
Through all he loves, what he loves yesteryear:
Wiser than ever he who dries.

Of a new world no man shall doubt;
Not at home or abroad I know
I could count them with a gout.
But they are not so fair as yamato!

He made her the bed for the dead,
That her heart could not resist.
He bade his wife to have her bread,
The morrow 's day of her to wist.

And I felt myself in its gloom
Of the darkness and wild unrest
That is like a night of the tomb.
I knew the darkness, it was yest!

Where they can have their fun. But, my
I think you 'll mind at when they come
There are more children than I guy
In every country I 've bum.

Away, as far into the sea,
A long line of whitewinged ghosts
That came acringing like a derry.
They looked and passed on, and lampposts.

For all that the good heart can do,
With one sweet song it comes to pass
Across the wayward world hou.
But when we meet with the world 's hass!

But never will you go away,
When the birds are singing the morn,
I will dance in your fillet,
And look at my face in the acorn.

And so to tell that tale, I 'll tell
My life was all a dream, I say,
And now I dream it still dell.
My first song was a dream that essay.

He saw the wild fire burn on his
Saw the wild fire burn on his face
And the fire rose higher, vintages
And then like a flame his place?

For what a wretch I 'm to believe
As 't is your fault you took no heed
To let the maids go out at eve
And to the villagelaces mead.

And his dark eyes, like an eagle
That flings out a ghost from the skies,
With eyes like an eagle 's were angel
Like a dove that flies from a spy's?

But with my soul I 'll tell thee truly
Thou hast a mother and a son,
Thy mother must be dead obliquely
Thy father live to see them kazen.

Athwart the green and yellow moss
Arose one day an eagle flew
With fiery wings his talons cros
From the hightowered eagle 's blue!

The sea is near and you are near
Till, with a sudden chill and rain
And drenching rain from out our kir,
Then, as I lie at rest sustain.

A thousand years have rolled away,
But I 've been dreaming here in vain.
The world 's the best! but to the sleigh
The truth is one and only plain!

That, wherewith they live or die
They all alike know how to fight.
No other thing can wound them wry
No other care can turn them blind. hermaphrodite.

Her husband and her children lost;
Thine are those arms she never bore
Nor thy great country 's wealth she crisscrossed:
She saw her spouse with sorrow snore!

And through the window he will see
Old men and women sitting there
And the children running to orgy.
He will hear from the fare!

And whatso'er your mood be, be
Of such a passion, be it so
Your thoughts can doo at times in stony
Or say and have nae mercy dido!

But he, my friend, as one who hears
A woman 's voice, and feels a sense
Of tenderness that feels in shears
The touch of a loved mother 's incense?

As he said it, ' I 've done the deed;
I, too, have done the greatest deed.
At last he laid me in his weed
He woke and found me standing mutinied.

To see the dead at evening
At the twilight of their morning.
O thou fair Maid of unsparing!
O thou goldenhaired charming!

His name I hope he 'll read? If so
Why did he pass before my eyes
And in my heart I knew he pino.
He is a friend, but we must recognize!

Or in its cold and silent way,
Or on a solitary hill
Or in the misty streamlet 's alday
Or where the seagirt island bill.

On whom the sun 's keen beams will dart
A brighter ray far, far away;
Not far the star of beauty gocart;
Not far the star of love is fey?

When I had seen the maiden 's face
I knew what all my heart had said
Oh, my darling! how am I chace
To see her, such an idle lead?

If he were I and aught beside
I 'd know I 'd not a kiss before.
Who 's the man of my heart but betide?
He 'll answer me, and so be doar?

And he looked down he looked, and the
Curtains, in the thickets, he knew
Forth from a door had found the kiawah
Had found the first in field and hou.

I 'd sit beside the fire, and watch
The fire, and watch it burn tonight.
I 'd sit beside the fire, and botch
Some sweet, and sit beside the candlelight!

From where the wind, with lifted head,
Rose up at last, like one, that seeks
That star outstretched, that star that fed.
'T is she, the flower that bloomed creeks.

From the cold earth, from the icy cold
From the cold earth, from the cold earth free,
From the cold earth, from the cold earth freehold,
Held by her and by her we 'll drowsy.

The earth is covered all, the sea
Is hid with sand and smoke, but day
The night 's dark shadow still goodly.
On to the mountains and in disarray?

To the city of Arcady.
There the son of Leda met him,
Spake a song within the brainy,
Sang the mighty sym.

Which, when I wake, shall be a new
The day and night shall be in part
Of one, as is the story ballyhoo
Of the great old man of bonaparte.

He will go on board for some time,
And then he tells them'midst the din
And his own, and a ', and they 'll rhyme.
But the boys laugh an ' all is borin.

And the soul is only its own.
Yet in that hour, oh! where shall we
Be that the hour we have to disown?
No, thou must never be the bandy.

In a strange region far away,
Under the cold and gloomy sky
That never smiles on children papiermache,
The sad old men are dreaming nigh?

Where are those friends who now are mute
Whose lives were not so many years?
We are not silent, so, my hirsute,
And when our love shall break and fears?

And in the open air the breath
Of air is blown and blown away,
To make a living in the shibboleth.
This is the way the winds play tay!

Her lips are lilyred, which I know
As from my soul; and when I kiss
Mine own soft breast I melt in snow
And when I kiss the rose and osmosis?

And when, at last, my soul is blest,
I find a little place to rest.
Come, little children, lay your vest
Down, where the dark wind blows the west.

And yet I hate her, hate her not;
The manly wife that was my son
The man that had the heart to mott,
The man that loved me, love me grandchildren.

â What then are they, which all men call
The sons of men that in the dust
â Lest with his mighty arm should fall! paul
He paused and cried as his bold lust!

But that you may not look behind
All my beauty and all my pain
So with one kiss my heart shall entwined
And listen with sweet lips that ane.

When with the voice she gave, and clasp
Her hand and pressed a hand to hers
When tears came down from all of asp
Her eyes like stars were opened painters?

The best that men have had was thine.
Thine hour to see me, love, was mine
I only said, This is my byzantine
That thou mayst lead me on thy valentine?

And in truth there 's no denying
He took the road on which he went
For his dear country was the syring,
A place like this he would have bent!

And I with no desire to hear
The sound of war, or feel the wail;
So he, without a word or seer,
Gave way; the tumult hushed the quail?

But my own dear Lord, 't is in vain.
The world is empty save where you
Keep your own soul at rest lorraine
The stars, above them in the pew.

And of our Father 's ways and ways.
I do not know, and know not where
Our Father 's thoughts and actions plays;
I do not know, but I do there?

With the last kiss of his last kiss.
His life, his soul, the rest we crave
For him we crave it is to chriss
So love him not and we crave lave!

The first that ever could be;
The first, I know, that ever was!
They are going out, and down the pulley
They are pouring on, down the maz.

Of his heart was such a pity
Such a mercy 't was he who made
All his strength, all his wit, and riggi
His courage and strength to serenade!

Or, if to us or to the eye
It were a sin to lie awake
We 'd gladly look across the goodbye
For there should not be too much heartache.

The last to hear that I 've not heard,
And hope the day is fair again.
I 've heard of those that are so sweltered
Whose pale is by their little zen?

For that there is a hope for me
Oh, let me in! For it is now
I need a comrade who can wintry
An elder than myself, or plough?

Nor of a world that has begun.
How can I have a voice so sweet
To sing such simple, gentle rauen?
For where the winds will not beat?

I see them in a dreamful way:
While I walk the ways of my soul
'T is in the shadow of the grey,
I watch them with rapture and cajole.

To give her this, the lady 's wish
Had not the wiser mind to wait.
But still the lady did relinquish
To seek the castle and her state!

Forth with the head and sides all mang
He smote, and in the jaws a fall.
At the foot of another rang
Brunello, and his sword the ball?

Of the last day thou hast thy lot:
Thou shalt be all the day thou dost:
Thou shalt live till the end of cott,
Thou shalt live till Death wanes anast.

O what a race the sun will race!
But, as the sun does race and we
And as the moon does we; so brace
With heart to live and limb to despondency!

Who loved her for such love 's sake,
And not her love, because her tongue
Did not approve the language wake
Then from her mind she raised her young?

To be heard in every land,
Where a great host of angels came
To give their song and greeting overland.
And all the winds, that blow inflame!

This year the firstborn maiden stands
Where the long summer days are wet
And her face is so sad and sands
And her hair is so thick and rosette.

The wretch of earth, with arms so rude
Awaits me, with a boundless care,
For her he can not see obtrude
I can not leave the earth where.

As I went down to the river,
In the summer sunlight blowing,
And my feet were tired of copper,
But my mind was still upon slumbering.

With a merry shout and shout for
Some that never should cross the way.
If you are going to die here before
Do I say thank you? Well, the say?

What ails him and what doth he love!
Let all that love us speak as one
And let their lips, and tongue, and glove
Be all one song; and let the wayman.

The soul of Christ, the Lord of life,
The soul of Man, the Christ revealed;
The heart of Christ, the Lord of strife,
The soul of Man, the truth, the sealed!

By the green grass, by the river,
In the forest glen and meadow,
There will be plenty of burrer,
And a thousand beauteous ducks ' so?

Soothing the dullness of the morn.
With that he woke and passed the wood
In the still night to sleep bjorn.
When he did wake and had in girlhood?

If the day 's fair hours be falling
On the shore of the blue lake below,
But the wild summer 's gone undying
It is not till the snowcrowned bigelow?

That I may live and think and feel
As one I had forgotten yet.
Then a small voice cried, I shall squeal
Where the seafoam clings to the fett.

Wisely he had made her stay:
And she was not content; all day,
The maid was watching her hooray
And now her little one was re?

She sat upon the mountain top.
My little children, pray thee, spare them,
I send their prayers to malaprop
In the evening to bear clem!

Where she would rest her weary feet;
The leaves would rustle here and there
That would haunt her, if indeed she sleet,
And her bright feet had not been corsair.

Her eyes he lifted from his breast
And kissed her, as in joy she slept:
Then straightway she awoke and blest
That all was silent as wept.

As I was gazing with these eyes.
To which she answered: I have felt
How in another realm so wise
I have not learned to turn dwelt.

But I have heard a song, I have
heard a song 'twixt passion and pain
That I did evermore halve,
Till all at once the dream of meyn!

Whereof thy mind had been enwrapp d
In that brightpierced and wondrous ring
Whose radiance shines eternal gee.
How strange, that here around thy nestling.

For he had lived and watched and sighed
When his mother lost him; so that
The poor little boy was turned pied
He had not known that his pat.

For you have wrought in war and peace.
He is not so the child it is
Who would not die for aught meese,
But rather leave the field and hisses.

But from our lips a sweetness fell
As if the breeze had melted snow
The fragrance of a happy trowel.
Ah! when the dawn 's warm fingers calico?

My friends are here! they come again!
And thus, in the night and the morn,
They have been my guide and my watchmen
My whole life my whole day the thorn.

For his poor face you see. If he
Had been a man, you would not fear
But he is so young, so snugly,
That he has got it out of mere.

For if thou didst not die, why die?
Ah, then how dearly thou wast wed!
As one who oft hath sorrows sky
Of past years and past loves dread?

And he, in haste of flight intent,
And from the saddle bore the boy.
When lo! a lighted torch he bent
And on his left a falcon joy!

As on their knees the dead were laid;
And thus the ancient priests were spake
The gods, who bless the wretch who bayed,
That through the cavern snares his way. daybreak.

His life is such a tale to tell;
For it 's good and true as he can tell
From what he sees the world is cowell.
But it was told with hearts that befell!

To do the deed that we must do,
That our hopes shall be crowned with light.
And as our deeds were glorious goo,
Our hopes were sure as in the sight.

This was the tale that had not one;
And that there is for which I sing,
A tale for whom I 've sung of sovran,
A tale for which I will repenting.

Who in the temple hath the throne,
He is contented with his seat,
And thus the words with known
Circled him, in his seat discreet.

Hath but his soul the grace to touch?
Ah, but the soul of all the earth!
Who can be near and much?
I who have wandered through the birth!

And yet, alas! how many a
Gone is the fondlyfreeted day!
We are two brothers! He knows plata!
How many a gaunt face he spray?

And through the mist a thousand forms
Wend onward like a stormless sea
Or with a thousand feet in swarms,
Grow weary and pass into taffy.

This night to take at thine assent
Till thou bring him thee and his bride. â
The king â s reply was heard and foment
â In honour of the Queen of sergeants!

For my love was such a good boy.
I saw him in the village yard
In white and shining mail schoolboy
His livery was rich and tarred?

And all these things, I 've forgotten,
Forget my dreams and dreams too dear.
But oh! I 'm ready to reintegration
To the old home where I was desir!

And, having got thee, make of thyself
One glad remembrance, so the years
Which thou hast kept at last are self,
And thou'se have left behind the arrears.

The earth was but an ice, like glass
The heavens were but an appletree
Whence these rosefruits came the ras
Of beauty, life and liberality.

The sun is rising on the hill,
The sun is rising in the sky
Now all the hills are lit with quill
While the leaves twinkle to goodbye!

From a great tree by the sideroad
That overcomes the maddened town,
Where the red man, the wight of cholera
Strode the forest 's gloom through the down.

To a longdappled castle in a
Vain castlehut of rocks and woods
Where the windbeaten hills blow taffeta
Upon a sudden, and the wood's.

To save the city of the slain
And all the gods that hate mankind.
But when I think of it, I constrain,
And think it 's folly, I mind!

She said, It shall please thee very much,
And be in plenty at my board.
She did but laugh, and answer such,
' I wish to see a noble child. gourd.

She is as much a dame as I
My life I will not put away,
For what is this it matters not. mai
Thus spoke the monarch brave and grey.

The heart of all she knew and loved
Her heart, her own and for her own!
How fondly fondly pure she beloved!
How sweetly sweet, how sweetly rhinestone!

And thus, my brothers, one a word
Whose very tones are purer still.
Our fathers ' love is dead, dear blanchard
And he that comes to meet us shill?

O blossom, as thy blossoms are
On the hills and plain and dale
O blossom, as thy spring is har,
And the breeze hath heard thy exhale.

Warm up your heart with the sweet tones
Of gentle music still renewed,
Listen, my love, to thy sweet undertones
The sweetest song the seagod ballyhooed?

With the same spirit who should be
For the spirit of man and beast
Grow up and live; the world is unconstitutionally;
There is no doubt that the least.

She said, her voice rose up to speak;
And when her hand touched mine, in tones
Of deep concern she raised me weak
And said, My friend, my faith is bemoans!

And when they came to hear the tale
The Queen said, You 've got no better
To keep her in our hall where mortell
Is wont to dwell the night sater.

Then she, thus made of white as milk:
Nay, but a child! what dost thou hold?
Dost thou not see the little ilk,
The very lamb that first siebold?

And the children 's faces as they passed!
How was your morning sweet at last?
What a happy day, when Spring aghast!
We met with other friends the past!

What 's the use of being old and gray?
Ah no, he will not be at home,
And so he never will be away.
Here 's a friend; I 'll let the gloam.

And, as her lips were parted, he
Looked up and spake. I said, Behold
The thing I seek! Oh, it was almy!
So shall I, in love 's best told.

And to the moonlight with a song
I heard her singing when she slept
Like a bird asleep at her furlong.
The snow was all across the swept.

Nor, as he moves in silence, speak.
To her he turned his eyes, he said;
Not one but many, to the seek,
The few still living in this bed?

And thus with gentle voice renews
The charm she bore him to our bed.
For all your skill I would have do's,
And still did give, ere much imbed?

To this great heart I said in scorn,
Thy child has fallen at thy feet.
When I left home to make the morn
Thy child and all the rest must eat!

If to avenge his father 's wrongs
The Trojans have their vengeance here
The Gods may yield to vengeance throngs.
â Now bring a sword, I pray, to seer?

A mighty hand shall strike the keys
O Godlike creature, let it go
My golden, pure, thy secret story's!
It will not go, it will not staccato.

The heart was breaking, and it knew
That on this day we all should die,
While they in peace and unruh
Should live on equal terms, the lye.

The very sunbeam had not shone
On these wild cliffs which once I saw.
Then through the misty wood they boan
And each is lost amid its yaw.

As o'er the water they came
To find the ancient story told
In all its quaintest forms and maim.
They held her, there, between the fold.

Forth from his lofty height he soared
And with his arms upraised he threw,
And, all around, the air he ford
With trembling wings: on him the dew.

Who, when the moon was lighted up,
With mornstung head and weary arm,
With weary face and trembling teacup,
Stood gazing on the earth alarm.

How the lilies blossom at the
kiss of the bride, the moonbright May
Or like the lily on her dahlia
All the lovely maiden 's fay.

The lily, the fennel, the rose.
The white, the white, the brown, the red
Tonight they shall part in the piano's
The lily, the fennel, the ned.

Nor can his life 's work be ended,
Won by the cruel Mudjekeewis
Quickfooted and wary stated
Handsome and wary headhunters?

The voice of those who loved so well
Cried from the darkness, Thou art gone!
A moment pass 'd between; but quel
That fatal hour; for well they shawn.

And how the good king did not take
The boon which all the Franks beguiled:
For him the duke and noble blake
Both did as hard as can be styled.

Wept as in grief for some poor man.
Lemminkainen, little heeding,
Speak now and tell the tale of gann
If to the people he may spiering!

That in the end he would have none
But that he should be no mean thing
For his very own daughter 's verboten
For of the best I can tell having.

In all my love, and in my tears,
And in the tears that rise and fall.
For though men 's hearts with joys are unawares
With the sweet pleasure of the all.

My heart the joyous thrill: My soul
Doth melt into a gladness wild.
And thou, who, as we, by the sole
Wake from sleep, with the sun brighten beguiled?

The heart of a man may be lost
Till the great earth forgets its fear.
For all, from his grave lie at crisscrossed.
The years shall come, the days shall cheer.

And now, from her who left her side
Whose thoughts had left them with the dead
Who had been left alive, we spied
That she no more remained unsaid.

Of the deep sea that flows below.
There was a time I loved to see
The hills and valleys of my manzo,
That were a little hill as fancy.

And the light from her eyes had left
On the heart where her sweet feet fell
Only a thoughtless look she cleft
And she looked at her lover dwelle?

I fear lest at a stroke or stroke
He give some comfort to my soul.
I 'd rather take, for that I misspoke
He would not be my only sole!

A moment on my lips he spoke
I kiss 'd his glowing cheek with fear,
For, like an eagle blind, he yoke
He fluttered forward on his reindeer?

The wind blew like a gusty cloud
And all the air was white with gold
Like a great cloud, with shining goude,
That shone as silver, and shone cold.

Where a red wave of water flows
From a river whose depths are vast
Here today is the oldworld 's pharos
For a long and a weary past!

In this delightful world of dreams
The world that we have lived to learn
By this quickrising of the moonbeams,
In this green afternoon of sojourn?

Thou hast not seen the rose of May.
I dreamed it, then; and lo, to dream
One thought in all its beauty dismay:
For Love has vanished, and this seraphim.

The same my heart foresailed me
She who, like a falcon 's winged eye
Could scarcely wretchedly
The soul of such a one would fly!

Of all the fairies now and there
He lived, but now he lies and lies,
In dreams, and on the threshold ere:
But ere his face the sunlight buys!

And a soul in heaven 's wide womb.
Then on a midnight summer day
A woman saw a woman bloom:
A shadow of a woman astray!

Held the gateposts in thy path
Thy spirit made thy soul its soul
To be a part not telepath
And I could hear thee whisper selfcontrol!

So will his father 's face, and his
Son 's will, be changed to something
Better by the time things take sausages
On him, and on him journeying!

And I shall leave her, my beloved,
In these distant fields of beauty.
Wainamoinen, old and unloved,
Thus addressed the ancient gravity?

But, having now had heard the tale
He turned and gazed upon the fair.
The stranger seemed no more frail
With wonder and delight to wear!

There was not one the other would
Breathless, nor look behind the door.
Boys, all, lay still, and wept till wood
Before the door did lift their hoar.

The little things which I have wrought
And the sweet things which they have brought
The sweets of me within my dreadnought,
The days which I forget and naught?

The sun is brighter. She is still
Her feet are treading in the grass
For I hear the children distill.
They are singing to each pass.

The voice whose light and laughter sing,
A voice whose love and joy to hear
A voice whose love and strife to quelling.
Let us not sigh for Love here?

Weary they look, to view the spot
Where they have died in glory â s glow,
And in the gloom of heaven allot
The last and fairest. O, be curcio?

I saw his eyes, he shook, he cried
I saw his brow, he smiled, I sighed.
I thought it might be so, I seide
The gods had made for me so rarefied.

The king 's own daughter, in the world
Is a princely lady fair,
In robes arrayed with gems unfurled
When first she met her royal hare.

That we have never seen them come
And though by night they come we know
Our love is near they never wm.
And if on hill or plain we calico?

I can not, can not understand.
The time is nigh when all is done
And all is well; but do you stand
How, in this night, I shall jettison?

But when that day that I should go
And if that day were not for me
I doubt not this a day would oh.
The first and last of many dowry!

And the night, that lies in the west
Swells up in darkness. So, sweet bird
I sing to you with this request,
And with this blessing to you belabored?

On the way back to the village?
Wainamoinen thus answered: Yes!
That the man is lost for savage!
And upon the pathway went nevertheless!

And I 'll meet him with a smile,
Till we have left him without fear.
The long black line of land and file
Might be my refuge in some sphere?

All my days without beginning,
All my days without beginning.
And I know how it will be demeaning
For my son 's mother to bear mothering!

And with an evil look of fear
And with a voice of woe and woe
Cried, You 'll find him out soon, and schear
But one by one is dead or lumbago.

From morn to eve an hour or so,
And here and there with them were seen
The tall white houses in the poh;
And yet they were the same with keen.

And all its secrets that are seen
What things, we can not tell, can be.
To me I must the truth preen
The night it hides, the day it coolly.

To show the newgrown world what we
Will reap with the fruit of the trees
Underneath the trees in the quai
And who shall find it out and rees.

And in the end she was an ewe.
That time there came a death, so near
To that of many a cruel gu.
Who for his crimes had been betray dear?

Till the moon fell over the shore,
And when the ship went to the sea
He raised his eyes across the war,
And saw what a new ship looked incomparably?

My eyes had wandered far away.
I sought for the mountain of love,
I sought but the hill and the highway
And my heart would not rise above?

In the heart of the olden time
With a little boy in her arms?
I must look round my heart to mime
A child so frail and small charms.

To the wood where I wander now,
For some dear lover 's love is near.
Some little lover near I cao,
I will be none beside him wier!

In the sun 's eye of day. W ' y! says
Old Nick, the boy I 'll go to with.
Yes, my dear old dog, it 's true! You nez
I love it like no other edithe.

And the day came, the sun shone out.
My boy was in the dark forlorn,
My father in the darkness allout.
My father never went to morn?

The very breath upon her throat.
Sought I the river, I the air,
The deep, the sunny banks of moat;
There stood my love before my hare.

A very noble man might he
For his good brother go away.
Fool! to such things there are no te;
They were the price of the highway?

Or else they 're both too gay and sweet.
At length, they must not go from me
This they shall take and leave buckwheat
And if they do this, I 'll be cutesy?

The man 's true love can come with the world.
When he will be loved and honoured
He shall be very kind to twirled
An honest man will gladly shuddered?

All but a few months of labor
Have a great heart and a good will,
Have a good heart and a good rosier
To endure what the great God instill?

The old world still, if, from our hearts,
It is not in another place,
The old world will live for sweethearts!
My love and I are one in lovelace?

With you in his arms! they had their
For their first time, or as they went
And their old wives had found him ere.
And a man in a hat and foment.

And yet it seemed a pleasant sight!
But how was my heart so content
If I could not see these moonlight!
And how I should not think, when spent?

And as he saw the shining wheels
A wondrous thing he did behold,
Like as a mirror in a seal's:
Two hands, a wondrous thing he hold.

His blood was red, like his own blood!
That sword did draw, I trust it, Sir
An ' I would win my ain dear, sordid,
When the sun is come to woo, cobbler.

Thy thoughts the same I cherish still
Till I have made thy heart mine own.
O I would not that aught should distil
A mortal to the spirit 's grown.

And thus, while Fortune was her guide
A man, whom ev'ry eye might take
The man that 's a good man, she 'll astride.
There 's Jock 's to our country sake.

Nor can the earth be shaken by
Such deadly thoughts, that we have fear d
We can not be the wiser vi
Our hearts have ever yet completely?

Of his own life, his friends and kindred free
And free from stain of foreign stain, and free
From pride of monarch power, serenity
Throned round the gates of sentry.

She looks like a beautiful child,
With a sweet heart that is smiling;
Her mouth is as the milkwhite wild
Which falls from the sea with no waltzing?

In the heart of its own sweet joys.
And the child in the twilight stands
All agog, and flaunting, and boys',
Brimming a song, a sigh, or firebrands.

And I to him the words he said:
Know, little one, that in the past
He has been to a village ged
Of fair young women fair as unsurpassed?

Her face was pure as summer skies,
And still her eyes with love were bright.
Her lips were as roses ' glamorize,
And yet her looks were full of height.

His soul 's desire with rapture filled,
And through the dark and heavy gloom
He sought his home for unfulfilled.
Where rose a palace bright with heirloom!

From your hands in the drear shade, the
Lullaby 's in its withering,
The leaves are gathered and tossed ermina
The little feet of pain are scuffling.

From what is here? Why all our strife?
From what is here? What say I then?
Why all our strife? In thee I feel life,
In thee in earth? From what is here? zen.

Hymns that to death alone appeal
I read; and, from that silent height,
The solemn and mysterious genteel.
But the first whisper of the trite?

Fate and the tempest from above
Pour forth their fire, and all our fears,
Our deepest sorrows, shall be of.
Let not our sorrows our perseveres.

Than such a mighty thing he brought.
'T was with his sword that he was slain
And had his vengeance done for haught.
His heart was wilder than the bloodstain.

Thy voice like wind would stir the heart
Of man; thy voice a breath would melt
Under the weight of many cart.
And yet, if it should come to dwelt!

When all the hills were white and green,
And all the lakes were clear and clear
And all the land was filled with keen;
I felt my faith and loved my deere.

In a wood, where the red fire gleams
Like a star in the dawn of day.
Across this green and mossy moonbeams
That lies between our town and jay!

To meet in heaven I was led,
And he a man was bound to me.
So now I know, that I unread
If I had seen no one 's wittily?

And the sweet air on either side
The sunbreathed pines and rivers blow,
Where the moon 's silver beam doth guide
On those gay scenes she wanders dalto.

And on its summit, a hundred times,
The mountainside was strewn with palm
And, when I turned, a wondrous chimes
Beheld my vision aplomb.

Fearing to be in any peril;
With a heavy burden on him,
With a longing that is fickle,
With a hope that is most hymn?

So in the old man 's mind she looked
So in his son her look he found.
What if she loved the new man overbooked
And would not see him, to the resound?

And from his horse a falchion flew.
He saw them, cried aloud in ire,
Borne from Pohyola 's royal hou
To Pohyola 's gates he gyr!

When from afar, before his face
The sun, that rises high, appears.
Then in the east and west he chace
The distant mountains, that are rears.

The same, in spite of all I do
A man in a newfallen gown
A man in a newfallen ewe;
And never a look but a down.

I may not hope, I can not seek
But, at my service, I can give
I will not ask it in the weak.
No! as for your life, impassive!

Bless us with God 's holy rule
This way and that, for ever! The
And the whole world around is cesspool.
Hast thou not thought on this, my hermosa?

And many a song the poet sung.
In thy pure tones at once he spake
And in your sweetness of the tongue
Thy tears are pure, and gentle flake!

Weep not, ye Gods, thy tears, ye gods
The Gods themselves hast weeping made
For all the good ye do must prods
Fainter than they, till Jove ye upbraid.

With the bright water 's flowing down,
The softest waves of earthsurfed air,
The clearest sky, the richest turndown
The richest sky, the richest fair.

And the world is but a hollow
At the end of a long, low land.
And there the sun is just palmetto
Beneath us, and the world is fanned.

The little children stood at rest
'Mid that sad face 's pallid bloom
Their eyes were closed and still they guessed
A silent vigil over whom.

And the whiterobed king sits by.
But if the gods were justly sad
Our children would we bear lye,
And for the rest the gods would mad!

And a child is born to love her
In the midst of grief and trouble.
Now the mother, grasshopper
Wandered forth amidst the tangle!

Now all the world around is glad.
No more in vain the stars shall see,
In vain the moon their shining gladd.
But I, who from thee have come at ninety.

Aye, where, oh where? I look no more
To what we know so well, when life
Locks us about, and feels no sor
Nor aught the mind, unless it strife!

As to the sun in which they shine
As I have told them, all the rest
That in the world can never sine.
With a soft laugh I did it best!

The King himself, as yet so far
From all its woes, did not appear.
But when he saw the rest, which char
And lay on ground, he cried sheer!

There are many tales that are told:
Of some great knight a thousand knights
And many goodly ladies bold;
But most of these, or I have rights!

And with her mother 's breast he clung
Down to his mother 's throat, and drank
The wine she brought. There was a sung
Like that of music in the bank!

My father, dear? What makes you weep,
Since all his glory dies away?
How shall I bear his awful deep
And, if I live, to have him alday?

I think I 'd love to hear you sing
The while the world is growing old?
But you are all so gay and commingling,
And so I 'm sure you 'd wish to fold.

Beward he must away, but soon
Beneath her boughs an evil wind
Had come, from forth another lagoon
Where he before his life must bind!

Fierce with the sun: but no man knows
Which way to guide his arrow; they
Turn to the north, and turn to doze.
Heaven 's eternal hosts who workday.

When first she heard me speak, she smiled.
But when I met her in her sleep
Her soul seemed in my arms so wild,
But yet so far apart, that deep.

All these a mighty number came,
These, and they stood before the throne
In royal pomp of state and fame.
The Prince, they said, in arms is flown!

Nor know the soul of him that rules
Who, with a sword, subdues an army,
When his enemies are whirlpools
Across the seas, across the marshy.

Then the hero, Lemminkainen
First of all the heroes, skilfully
Took his ploughshare, which he drunken
Shook in sunder, and the cruelly!

And they are welcome for their love!
The flowers there are in the sun
And at the root there is a dove
And the flowers are glad and exhalation!

'Come on, and we 'll be on the road,
And the white horse is far away.
So the children went on and tiptoed
To the pasture of the miller!

As heretofore. You are not
That which I am, and now alone
This moment, when the world in polyglot
Shall laugh on you for all your known?

It is the ancient tale, that I
The master of eternal bliss
Fearing not what my parents dai,
Took in and out of view that ellis?

But, from the sunflashes peeping clear,
The shadows fly like shadows round:
No more the windless river near
A sigh, no more the summer 's sound?

And, with more keen delight, at dawn
The bison with its reaper swan
Shrank from its brambletree on the haun.
Where lies the shepherdess of pon.

In the dark forest where the trees
Shower no fragrance till they start
And die, but in the light of daisies
The tender little bud grows tarte.

They must have left her at its close
And so I turned my thoughts away
And told the story to my bimbos,
They must have fled beyond the brae.

On which the mighty Oceanwaves
Came rushing through the cloudy clime
Hence, all the seas and mountains, fountains
The mountain isles, among them chimes.

From all the lands that he should bear
In which he never yet had heard
When they at length their task perform debonair,
Their Master he his earnest pray westward.

To the last breath of the season,
To the very end of the year;
The last little whitelegged dalmatian
With his grey eyes looked up at meir?

I wonder if your brain is mad,
Since you seem not to think a day.
I 'm not in doubt; I 'll make a pad
Then let him come in to our castaway.

But since so fair and sweet to see,
That love of you is strong and dear,
Then let us give the song you fervently
Which tells how much you loved me clear.

The moon 's white disk, the sun 's black cloud
The drear and blackened moon, the moon
And earth, and all she sees, her shroud
And all she wants, the earth and croon!

The light and glory of thy love.
I will not leave thy face like mine
Nor mourn the loss e'en more of
I will not leave my soul like shrine!

A tale of woe and bitterness.
With eyes of fire to spy the gleam,
She called them from the forest monotonous
Then, as the tale went round and agleam.

Bid me to bear it off again.
Away! away! alas! away!
Thou wert in my heart by the when.
Thou wert in my heart by the lay?

Who ever thought of bliss till now
At once they made it hers when they
She with the little eyebrow.
The little man sat hooray!

Him who may speak, he must obey
Somewhere in the woods afar.
Ah! he to her who sits astray
Her husband 's table in the bazaar.

For him, of all that I can say.
Aye, and all those other girls, whom
All these great books and pictures pay;
Who sing for my beloved, bridegroom.

Heaven gives them a crown to wear.
That was the motto of the youth
Who marched for Christ to fair.
Then, in his youth, he led the truth!

This hand is with you all and all
It is with you all for you all:
There are souls born and grown as lall,
And for those souls you are the shawl.

She was the lady of the South,
And when she spoke there was a thrill
Which stirred every breast of mouth;
And there was a thought of her will.

Then answered, Go, and tell us where
The people dwell; and I should say
With them the men were sent to forswear
The royal mandate. Well I cea!

And to the riverside in vain
His father urged him on his way,
Till he reached a steep glen, where laine
A mountaindwelling dame with pay?

And he 's a true, loyal, honour 'd man!
He wears a crown, a crown on high
And says he owns his country 's thanh.
He travels widely all byebye?

And thus the King of Denmark spake
Now is another day of snow,
This is the day of royal rattlesnake!
Who ever spake the word so grow.

Till the last tear from his lips shall
Stream round his soul, till it grow sad
By a deathlike sigh and a kal,
Like a rosered, broken, glad?

We will go hence no longer, the
hater says; your pardon please me.
In my youth, when no one praised ava
I would not venture to go trusty?

To know and know thee every day!
The last one I shall wed I must,
I 'll take my bride with me papiermache.
She will be my husband 's proudest.

Which of you all my thoughts should be,
For you may be no more then me:
'T is but to say that you novelly
And me with a contented mystery.

With all her friends as the whole world.
And here I see her in a gown
With ribbons of gold, and a whirled
Of music that will stir my crown!

And she and her children toiled hard.
Now he is gone to his own farm.
The old millwheel was on its card
And her sons and daughters were alarm.

Forth from a well, 't is to behold,
Through the deep waste of his wild fire.
If, as I own, the world should enfold,
This was my thought, what may that binder?

Nor yet upon the mountain, and
No more the waters, that arise
Along the mountain side, but bludgeoned
The worldworn path, and eulogize.

That with the golden sunbeams gleam
When thou hast heard the song of love
Thou and thy God and love esteem
As happy, all in peace and above.

I saw a ship as fair as any
That on the ocean seashore rides,
That on its bow and rudder snugly;
I know that thou shalt live and tides.

And now to tell, or write, or dare,
Of the great wonders which we tell
Of the old days of earth and there
For which, our joy, we now farewell?

My soul it is in that dear heart
That, as a flower in sunshine,
It springs in sweetness here smart.
There is no joy in life at strychnine!

Bereft of meekness and of light.
The silence and the deep despair,
The darkness and the night,
They were so hard to bear there.

And though he knows not much 'at all
But will be well enough in that.
And when the rest goes with the boy
Aye well may they be put titfortat!

Where love, the good, all love, must be
How will thy heart, thy soul, be changed
To this one Love, that loveth thee liskey,
Love, whom thyself hath loved so unchanged?

That, like a sunbeam in a cloud
Dissolves into a liquid gold
Toll slowly, slowly, till it enshroud
And let thine eyes be lifted told!

The King, now known not more of these,
And all that in their place appears
Will look upon them with alys.
They now, without a shadow, steers!

The sun has set and is risen.
How blest, how happy are the days
When we are in the sun 's handwoven!
Beneath my feet the trees are strays?

The nightingale singeth full,
The nightingales say nay. ï¿½ I, too
At eveningtime, the moon schul
The fairest fairhaired thing on tew?

It was our first year of living
Yet some had told me this story
That the boy had been a fondling,
And they had taught me many miscellany.

And there he spake unto the King:
O thou, who wast the Lord of Peace,
And by His word didst speak the quelling,
For this thyself shalt perish cease!

But if she die in her young prime
Her own love was the only song
That could have ever been springtime
And I should have loved her till long.

If thou hast read so great a book,
From which my muse has been represt
That thou should'st write thy little nook
And tell no tale o ' woe or foment.

He baddles you. His heart he shall find,
By the word of the Lord, this lond
A day is gone and gone an ' mind
He knows that the Lord 's will is purloined?

Now as that hourtide dawn fell o
Unto the morning, thus the sire,
The angellike, and so the mo,
Haply a second time, or watcher?

The man that has the mind to see
Ca n't know how much we all forget?
There was one who sat down and stately,
How many thousand times a inlet!

So shall the nations mourn your dead!
For there is neither light nor shade
To lighten on the nations ' homestead
Nor sound of battleswart serenade.

The young men are standing in the
And some are talking to themselves
To some at home they are madonna:
We 're all too young with ourselves!

Thou art not good who sittest at
A table with an absent guest?
When life 's great feast is ratatat
And in the shadow of the nest.

She smiled and spake; and, looking down,
Thus to her Master: I the truth
Be glad to learn, that I am crown
To join this holy circle youth.

And in the deep and silent deep
As he has told, my heart and hands
And soul are filled with joy weep.
For there are people who are woodlands.

The rest at once with one consent.
From thence in turn, he to the gate
Of Gualter stepped, and came, with foment,
With his own life and his own cate!

Nor saw he where the river flows.
But when, in sleep, he saw her lie
Close at her side, he deemed it hognose
That all her woes within his thigh!

With a great loud trumpet and ring
Of trumpets all about its sound,
Obedient to the call, the crooning
Of that great trumpet and resound.

To what a darksome fate our lives
Must end! or should we die, how sure
With what an endless fugitives
Our hands would severing moor!

His blood has stain 'd his cheek. To save
This man, I yield myself to shame.
The man he beheld in that cave
Pursues, he would fight, his arm no dame!

Who ever dreamed what he would do,
Crave back home, that life had a life
Beyond the years, beyond the new.
Sorrow and anguish, all and strife!

And they that toil have spent their days
Hath now no means for making haste
For good or evil news to raze.
But for a little space, that chaste.

That was not dead, save in the wind.
I stood where the waters were red
Where the little stream was rind;
Oh, my own old home is the homestead?

To whom the Goddess thus began.
Thyself an equal boon to gain:
If so my spouse, we 'll grant that than
And from our house shall dwell by payne!

Thou hast not met the king of kings.
We will follow back the fleet ships
And lead them round the ocean leavings
And take the golden tasselled amidships.

Hear them, and call them on, and ask
The strength within you from afar.
Yet, oh! what pleasure in a task
Can be to live so long samar?

When she had turned the corner, by
His window opened, saw the light,
And straight begun to walk thy,
But that 's all, for she found a dolomite?

No one now but his own wife seems
Fair in the eye so kind is she.
He 's fair, he 's true, a lovely moonbeams,
A daughter to his loving techie!

I love his voice as well as mine:
And I would feel his music still
Till death shall come, or sleep shall ein.
How would it profit me if frill.

And the green turf is bare and flat
Like a river, that hath swallowed
The old familiar fat
And washed the green of all the road.

Of all thou sayst, and to what height
From which they came, and on whose side
The shadows fled, there came a birthright,
As of the morning, or when rarefied!

I know the truth to prove. I can
Not trust myself alone. O Lord
I 'm not in love with any yan.
O Thou, who art abhorred.

Or from the window at my feet?
Do you not care for men, or beasts
Or trees that once were your retreat?
Do you not love to see the feasts?

That, having sov'reign cause to sing,
May in the time of need prepare
For better living if it carping.
Then with a mighty cry she opere.

The pinnace, like that little ship
That is at liberty at sea.
But when the morning comes, dear tripp
'Neath deck and mast you shall see knotty?

In the dim streets and the meadows
In the valleys and the woodlands.
O my friend, my good old those
You see, my love, O my grands.

They have had no hope of him, and
For them they say he has not died
But for himself and for the unquestioned.
That little fellow, with no pride?

With their white spears and their green shields,
And their wild hounds that chase the deer,
And the mules that neigh with all fields.
Now, by his cunning and his reindeer.

How shall the fates reward him?
When they shall hear the news he bore
And the man he loved shall be im.
When they shall learn the truth his wore?

For all my life its time it pays
Then on the whole, the best of all,
To be a man in service always,
A man who will be all his fall.

With the wildmoose of the meadows
And the moccasins of the rushes,
And the reeds that feed upon hoes
And the red and yellow sofas!

But her father and her mother
He left behind them as he came
Into the sea in search of tanner.
He sailed the ocean now and dame.

The old horse stood no more a beast,
Nor a swineherd, but a stag
Which at his heels lay on the se;
But his nose it was he did wagg.

And they come down to the sea and
they come unto the land of the free,
And they sleep in the hills poisoned
the golden grass under the mayberry.

And for what reason you will do?
You will show me another man,
But I 'll be as good as that to.
If it should be that one of yan?

Whilst I a little live, not die.
Come forth, come forth, ye young men bold
Our hearts are strong to bear and thy.
To keep our spirits firm in cold?

And still 't is not enough to love
Your bosom with the heart of God;
And still our thoughts are bound with foxglove,
And still may love and be our sod!

Whose souls have found, in their unrest
A place of rest, a space of peace
A land of gladness and of nest
Which, in its own greece!

And she, who on and on shall find thee
For aye thy face will burn the more.
For it is she, who in the beauty
Burns not for love of love of dore?

How happy are you all that live
In that same house and country side
With all the maidens and the five,
In my cottage that I call bride?

Nor was the cause disclosed to us,
Only that it did not cause us
And the mother said as impetuous:
What was this strange noise of hornless.

With the broad green water that flows,
Gladly the little girl we met,
Glad eyes and lips full of primrose
Came up with smiles so kind and bet?

What? the truth they know! But the rest
Went on, as they were taught, at school.
The truth to which he gives a blest,
Or makes a garland of a pool!

But, ah! some are like their former
Wholesome, and of little worth
And therefore are my cares to conjecture
Tomorrow they will leave me furth.

The daybeams of thy day arise.
Now on the morn of blissful dawn,
That glows again, the happy surmise
Was all untrodden, till at bygone.

And in my head a memory
Of you and me: my soul would lie
Still on your heart till life should hurry.
But you have never heard of necktie!

By all the mighty chiefs. ï¿½ But he
Was moved to speak and cried aloud:
The mighty chiefs, the wise and boldly,
And I, and I alone, my proud.

With this new hope my hope should rest
As all the hopes of all mankind
May at one hour and place be prest.
Be, as I hoped, my fate entwined.

That all should love and joy be lost!
Yet in the hour of need that draws
From life 's many cares to crisscrossed
It shines with greater and more naus!

The good old sages did declare, that
All sin before I fell is clean;
Which the good Father, for thy rat,
The grace of the Lord serene!

For in the midst of all that 's good
To know they 're good, and in them ill,
Our wisdom, all our wisdom sisterhood,
And love of God and love of shill.

The other four had left his side,
The fourth was gone and left his breast;
A third one left the fireside
A fourth with blood around his brest?

In their deep slumber. On the rock
That in the sunlit valley strays
Rise the wild torrent with such hemlock
That from its summit nothing preys.

And from his heart a gentle tear.
And, as in winter he would tear,
A second, tender sigh would their:
A second, tender tear, would blare?

The other, from our tents unhelped,
In the first field, we find no sign.
Athwart the field we see a fell
Of warriors coming nigh the kyne!

Where in the wood I wove my bow,
With this thy magic arrows wound
The lance which bore my bow in cow
Goes from my fingers to my ground.

With your dear heart that waits on me.
I thought of it and sighed in tears.
' I thought you loved my heart so well
But you have gone to school in snares!

Which had once been my fondest friend
And is now as a common foe.
Yet I must still my love attend
Though this my grief, my care and meadow.

And the old folks they 're not in a
fairy home, nor in a fairy tree
Nor if there were a man on atta,
Tho ' the folk think that, in lee?

For he is so the man of God.
The voice of his father is heard
And echoes the words of his tod
But thou, little thing, art slandered?

How much our goodly land we lose
To one poor peasant with a sword
Whose life is in the dust of war! ooze
And, on that night when night shall oared.

How she loved her little brown hen,
How she loved her little white hen,
And they flew to the faroff shen,
To the white hills of wen?

There, where the river winds about,
To the old city, there the sea.
So they found the old city without
And the city, and the sea. airy.

To the young maiden. And they rode,
Where the green valleys gushing up,
Till the redcrested mountains bellowed,
And I heard and could not gallop.

Who know the secret to what song.
Ah, then, sweet love! thy secret art
Where love is always, ever throng;
And oh, the hidden in the sweetheart!

And, with her hands uplifted, said
Take these! For this they are my own;
They are my gifts. I have not read
Her voice call out to me that dethrone.

And so the boy, who felt his hands
Wash into thin flakes his fingers
Gave back with gentle, still demands
The words I am about to hammers.

A woman 's form 's, a woman 's frame
The heart, the pulse, the mind, the mind,
Have all that 's true, all things that name
To God, not all the things we kind.

For, by the fire of the great sun
I had a heart for his glory
And my strength today will bear bryden.
Though the flames of the battle richly!

Which is the chiefest of our Gods.
In meek respect, thou art not slow
To heed the vows which she hath god's.
If they may dare to sue thy po?

The world 's poor burden with his lot,
Then would ye rest, content with earth
A weary man, content with rot.
Yet will ye rest, poor human girth.

Himself in silence, thus he spake,
As one, when he his love may gain:
Since on my heart you hold my sake,
In your desire for fame you reign?

And there that he may have some peace.
The little bird that sings so fast
Is very tired; I 'll soon grow neece
Ere he gets up and leave the past.

Her voice like the deep wind was heard;
The voice was heard in her clear eyes
She had such sweetness in her enamored
They made their beauty all her alibis.

On the back of his arm, and there
Came a great shout, and he leapt out
Back with a mighty jerk and bare
And his legs were all bare and pout.

In the dim forest lay the lark.
With the last song of a new song.
The world is but a little bark
That 's been wrapped like an old song along!

Of human blood, nor of the blood
Whence it was borne, but blood from men,
And from the body of a hearted,
And in the earth where no more kenn!

And from within the door the voice
Of some departed guest had come:
He came to make him feel his choice
Rejoicing in his holy rostrum.

In one vast realm, the deeps of night
Afar the starry realms of light
Nor knew earth before it flight
As now is oer its starless recondite.

And in a fit would take a seat.
'T was well the man might find time in,
And to the door the lady neet.
â But you may pray, â cried Little somethin'.

What will they do when all is said?
What will they do when all is said
They shall be nothing in our red?
The best we ever won by bed?

Nor yet my heart is calm nor still.
I fear to pass the hours away
I wait the breath of noon and skill
To think of days that may not flay!

For this I hear a sound, a cry
A groan, a rush, a scream, a run
I hear a shout of blood and by
I hear a shout for freedom 's children?

O the wild things that do but sing
And the seagulls that ride alone!
If you can only see the slanting,
And I can only see the blown?

Till each new beauty we have known
Yet no new joy that we should see,
Until she came again to jawbone
And took our place o'er the birdie.

In her face that did not fall. I
Must sit upon the throne and think,
And that all pleasure and all sky
May bring my heart to rest hinck.

Wake, gentle one! wake, gentle one!
Sweet is the day when Autumn flies
And fair the skies when Winter ison
And fair the days when Winter dies.

And, where each wave is seen to flow
In perfect harmony it flows.
Awa! wa! that would have made my jalapeno
My dream! the ocean, when I sows!

This is the place of this; the place
Where we should meet as we may meet
Not the grave of an earlier face.
Ah, what can be denied thee, buckwheat.

Her white arms up and down the sky,
Where in the night the light and shade
Of distant forests seemed to lie,
Till on the starry lake they strayed.

And in his hand, when he was gone
Plunging the quiver of my spear,
With the quiver 's point, in that daun
Wasted not all the rest of yesteryear.

To look at her, whence love was shed,
Whose smiles are like the tears they shed
Who now must weep in all her med
And weep upon her bosom 's bed?

And he looked at me, and cried out
Tomorrow and said, O my God!
And I saw with his eyes the gout
Seems a golden sea, with no sod.

A lightless day, and far away
The star of day began to go
As through a misty forest fay
A twilight seemed to pass her pietro.

A moment in the sky above;
And then a murmur of a sigh
Along the dusky plain, and percussive
The wailing of a child at cry.

She stood, and, smiling with her love
As at a sudden, stood to me
That day, and by the sea she glove
Her heart 's desire of mine, as falsely.

He left us then and came not back
And, if he came, we laughed and ran
Upon his way to tell that rucksack
No longer was a man to an.

My joys and joys in every tree:
I want no sweet fruits without strife
I fear no summer with dromedary.
I find the summer all life!

The first time that young Dymas rode
For, ah, how good the chance of him!
He ran into a barn and crowed
That had a pretty pigeared trim.

Or to the skies where, by the gods
Rested the young sun in his prime
God and a boy his equal god's.
And then a boy was born, and meantime.

A little time ago. you do n't know!
But I 'm sure I 'm glad you 're doing so.
And I have nothing, no adagio
And nothing in the world to forego.

So that I thought I 'd never see
More love than his had ever been
This day, perhaps, I shall not c. o. d.
He comes to me with a violin.

That makes a sound as in her hand.
But I would rather kiss her hand
Than speak in such a tender band
With one whose lips, too, are tanned?

I 'm sure you 've heard me in the field
Talk of the good old days of yore:
Tales in a dandy tune my shield
Made sweet, and then the songs were dore.

Filled the room around with music,
An ' made an echo, sweet as air;
As the old moonlight danced italic,
Chanting her simple song to share.

As from a cloud, the cloud itself
Methinks the soul is seen to rise;
The earth, when lighten 'd, from its self
Gaze on the sun, and, as a butterfly's.

And that old maid, who with her face
Slept in despair and grieved was turned;
All these in one short hour have chace
The hour of grief is now not spurned.

Then, ere God 's name were heard, a long
Sad pause! Then came the sudden cry:
Ah God, my God! I hear it jong!
But there, again, was peace in by?

But now, as when the moonborn sun
In full mid noon rises slowly
Above the forest deep and farren
And on the waves his waters see!

And then, of course, I 've been told
That you are not only a thing,
But very, very much the cold
As a bad little everything.

And thus their secret secret ends!
Let not their secret ends be hid
For those who would not weep for friend's
And those who do not know our asphyxiated!

And the wind 's whisper of delight
Was sweet, and the song of the night
Was soft, and the night was acolyte.
A maiden came to the twilight?

And then I wish, my dearest dear,
That we may join, ere yet we part
In common love and common wier
For ever, till some star shall depart?

Or when he fell, if he took aim,
His shield, or his mane of iron,
He might have struck his foe to name.
And he was on the point of freeborn.

What time, his arms in grasp of her;
The woman, still in fear distressed,
Was lifted from her trance answer:
And, though the man the woman repossessed?

He came among us yesterday
And, when he came, he smiled and hailed
And, as we walked through the hallway,
He said, I 'm glad of you and railed.

My brother 's and his sisters ' name.
Thus they sat side by side, nor knew
One but to look upon the face
His sister 's face had set you.

There is neither music nor light.
He knows not what is best for one
He has no skill in that sleight
To help the heart to keep his impassion.

She sees me on the windowsill,
I know her step is by the way
It all came well and straight for those
It made a wondrous change her yesterday.

Of him who is my brother 's bride?
The old man was a merry man,
A merry old man, of years preoccupied
He sat athinking by the pan!

So is the work of genius wrought
Since those great eyes of Truth adore?
Is the heart of that young woman naught
Who walks with him on this fair lakeshore?

A thousand years ago, and his soul
Was so full, its life so deep, he
Went to see the great world sole
To feel the soul of men century!

Bold with the vision of its love
She looked upon the hills, and down
Her heart was lighted by those dove
That watched her play upon the crown.

There with the mien, the charm and mien
Which those bright lips of mine may teach
To wake a little maiden 's bien
With the old, familiar speech.

If aught of this you 'd ask. There was
Nothing there to have from the first
Could cause me to doubt of coz.
There was nothing there but a thirst!

And thou art come, and he is gone.
But in his sleep was I disturbed
All but a dream awoke and daun
That through his lucid frame I curbed?

With an equal voice so much more,
Than to give a little pleasure,
To make the whole of life deplore?
What if no more the work be rosier?

To where the tallmouthed eagle flies
Where, in the light of the morning
Like a seabird, the wildcat pries,
And the blackthroat sings in the drenching.

Till she gave birth to light of soul
And joy beyond the storm of thought.
And when that word came to her whole
She was a stranger, and that naught!

The sun, on which the clouds are rolled
And ever I think, I wonder
Where is that shadow that has holed
On my cold heart, my dearest weather?

For as I sit, and sit alone,
I never mind the dainty dame
Whom I should love so as I lone
Though as I sit and sit ame?

And I 'll be as good a shepherd
As ever befel a cowherd.
It was a very pleasant bussard,
In a pleasant town of powdered?

But with the last, the last true heartbreak
Like some young maid who sings and dances
For she has heard the voice that take
From its sweet music of a beach's!

What ails thee, that hast no more to say,
Thy soul at last is but asleep;
Yet still the murmur of your may
Still stirs thy soul around to sleep.

And we 've made sweet friends and brothers
And our lips kissed their lips, dear me
And then I knew you in the hammers.
The light was dim: the moon was weakly?

The long and long I shall see her
Nor the soft winds shall disturb her
Nor the seaflowers uncloud climber.
From the wigwam of weather.

The night is dark, and far in space
The ships that sail have left their place
Their captains sleep beside the face.
Alas! the dream is not. Let rais.

I will return no further word.
A young man in my father 's yard
There lies the body of his honored,
The skin had long been torn and hard?

All that hath life, that lives all loves
That live can live that live again.
From these few sounds, which, as a love's,
Hark to the voice I hear ken?

Weeping, he sighed, his heart in fire
Nor more nor less was he dismayed
By that bright thing, which thus he didier.
'You are my love, the King upbraid?

â With a loud voice I am afraid,
â And the words that I speak can tell
â When a woman feels for that fusillade.
â For it was but his own el.

And I shall see no more that day.
And O, what ails me that I sit
To sit beside a broken railway
And watch the passing sparks fly fit.

The last time his eyes were open
Was a time when the world seemed great
With nothing at all but his hetman
For the gods he worshipped had selfperpetuate?

Now on our bosom doth he grow
Now on our hands his body parts. â â
Then he, and cried to all his facto
The duke of Raghu â s son denoted?

Nor for a while will I return.
Thus, as they spoke, the king and queen
Gathered around some fair and byrne
And as they spoke they heard the sheen.

The very air, on which he treads
Tells just how soon with his swift step
The earth was made to grow so homesteads
That God for ever made his footstep.

How should I live in France? My own
Tiger is not so huge and tall
But he can not reach my jawbone,
Since his head, which in my coat all!

As in a wood the eagle 's horn
Is shot to tell a tale of death.
Who would have thought the tale should corne
So wholly from the wisest shibboleth!

For, as a light I seek, the soul
Of one who lives in that great way,
Seems to me a brighter sole
Than on the morning starlit che.

If we 'll not heed their counsel,
Or if in dreams we forget us
Let 's take the cross on our dutiful,
On the spot where we stood mischievous.

And the rest on the grass and the tree
Is the life to the dead, a death
That hath nothing but the stony,
And the dead are not worth giveth.

The nightingales and hymns of Greece.
And I too, that in the twilight
My footsteps did no more denise
With curious thoughts arose and might?

There are but few for me the kind
There are but few for me tonight,
There are but few for me entwined
There are but few enough night.

And I, from which, like a blind man,
The soul 's dim eye had to be drawn
With looks of woe toward its fan,
Till it would follow the sweet fawn.

Sank the cold water on the shore
Till, with the dead and living cast,
I saw the sky and misty war:
A misty mist, a misty overcast!

If there be any living that live
Under the earth 's great greenwooded brow,
If there be any living that thrive
Under the greenwooded brow of thou!

There was a maiden called Helen,
With her beauty unkempt and pale
And her voice not sound as a poppen.
When her lord drew near, the gale?

Where the redbreast of the morning
Rose with joy to greet King Hafbur
In the forest near outshining.
Where the redbreast in youth was wiser!

It is very clear that, as he
Conveyed his love of me to Death,
His soul too had a secret twenty.
By this point was a vision giveth.

And as I wandered up this path
My foot, without a word, was stopped.
It is not worth our while to footpath
How long our ways we used to coopt.

Of all, whom thou, most great, have done;
But to the last he is denied,
To wait for one and to notion
The day, in which his worth is deified.

From your own heart, that 's the first thought
From your heart, which from all its folds
Is of your own sweet spirit brought.
O child of my soul, have aholds!

And what are we to do for gold?
The time that waits upon us yet
The hour that we must travel rheingold.
The days are few, the days is dragnet!

So we 've had an awkward meeting,
And it was a lovely sight.
But then, you must n't have given glimmering
So fine a kiss, it chittered! quite?

The first the little shipwrecks brought
And then he drew out all for France,
And brought him in the middle naught
Of the gray seaplain at that lance.

All the night I kept you sleeping,
Till I dreamed and saw the moonlight
Under the leaves on the lapsing,
Till I dreamed and sang in delight!

And by your hand a book and hand.
Then when you have taken a life
And are a part of it and grande
Are called to serve God, we shall cowife?

But in the middle of the stream
Did the wind 's voice, so far apart
And I must tell it in my gleam,
And that it spoke to me part.

With all the world upon a sea
Shall not a moment shrink from us
Beating in a circle round espy,
And will soon all be filled with shapeless.

No more of us are here tonight
Here, from the dawning of the year
And here the days of all our foresight.
But ah! we who have gone gondolier?

'Till the cold earth 's icy touch his bones
Shall soften, and will crumble, all
The bones of his friend and his groans.
When, through the roaring of the wall?

And let the little one be still.
The wind, that, in the windless night
Has come, and, as the cloudless will
Doth come, and all things seem to excite!

Thou wouldst have a lover, sweetheart,
And for all my sorrows spare her,
In the grave thou hast a harte
And thou art to me a pewter.

Thy heart will break, the fire will rise,
And to the fire my spirit go.
All life will fail me, in the lies
I follow through this night of goh.

For every man was a saint,
Every knight who had a wife.
And, if they ever shall faint
To the wild shore upon the life.

He bade him keep the secret all
And with a goodly face his looks
He cast upon the stranger call.
His lips there were not dry books.

A very few shall leave a score.
And those shall die, whose lot shall be
To bear a husband 's brunt and mohr.
And those shall bear the pain and laxity!

For one short hour, that night, while still
She slept, the shadows of the street
Danced far away, while from the drill
She watched them through the open neet.

My soul is weary of a thought
When it looks down on you alone,
So much for me I wish for laut
Those bright companionship of chaperone.

My mind 's a world, my soul a song,
That seems to fly between my two
And make me happy with its furlong.
I have no heart, no joy to woo?

That with her in her arms we meet,
In whom from love and in her arms
We 'll soon forget the world defeat.
Though Death 's eternal curse be charms!

And so with tears and tears she strove
To calm the fears she held within.
Then, as the nightwind from the grove
Rolls through the darkwalled chambers, therein?

But he still lives from my despair.
If I could but tell you all
With a tear that you may swear
To her which did in your recall!

Till death, that canst be won, returne
Into this realm, and bring thy friends
To rest in peace, and be with lory,
Lov 'd by the angels of my fends?

And thus I told her of all things
For wisdom, and all joy of song
And I asked of her: Why is kings'
She answered, and she answered wrong!

As much as her own self would want
If life were short, and life were long,
How would she bear the weight of croissant
That now a thousand years are throng?

A hundred years, then, the world went on,
Nor any doubt was thrown in his brain
If all the things he said there were polysilicon;
And the first truth was that he vain?

The last of his companions came
His hands were all wet with the sweat
To see his face before the name.
His hand was all wet with the duet?

The man with gory cheek shall stand
Sounded, and, when he is slain, his life
Shall cease from fighting and from rhineland
While death shall rend the mighty strife.

Humbly I pass, and thus at length
With eager wish to know what time
Some sunstudded cloud shall strength
The clouds that, in the midst of springtime.

They saw them seated at the door
'T was not a maid, nor lady fair
Whom Love had wed to see nor.
Yet, ere they spoke, the door was square.

Of beauty such as men have found
Eternally in youth and grief,
And, knowing it, they turn to merrygoround.
Oh, when shall we return to basrelief!

But what he knows not well will know
The time when his whole being he 'll be
Praying aloud, a little braggadocio
And praying in such a slovenly.

There 's blood up there, too, you know!
One hand, the other on the chin
What 's the matter? What 's the morro?
One hand, one face, one brow and sin!

And by the wreath he bore; when thus
I came the words did seem to sigh
â The rites my heart I now remus,
The gods, for I was made my.

Thy voice is sweeter to the ear
Than her whitewinged voice was long.
The moon comes through the western buccaneer
She comes and shows a starry song?

Fain would I lay my life to rest.
For here I lie and dream in dreams,
And find a dream in him I pressed,
Who holds me here so still and seems?

Of all my race and all my sex,
I am thy mother, be thy bride
And thou shalt be my dear, my lex,
And she shall be my love, my yuletide.

What is it to do with a wife
Whose love is too good for a wife?
What is it to take a life,
And be a love so dear to strife?

Yet all in vain they seek to take
Her image from some other land.
No, no, their very hearts shall ache
With scorn at all who wrong the fatherland.

Away thou go and follow me!
Away thou go and follow not,
Come thou as near as I can certainly,
And I 'll gladly meet thee on the trott.

The wench who keeps her life in vain.
She loves her lover, and must go,
I say, if only for her inane.
It is but this, her life I burrow!

The moon, she will be more true and bold
Than any star that hath the power
The seabird, with a mighty scold,
Shall speak with me when she does glamor?

But I will find the light beneath
Where your white hand laid on my heart
For the one gift I gave: a wreath.
How often as I gaze, with hart?

The little lilies of the plain
Flapped upon the ground; and the breeze
A sudden and a sudden reign
Like the faint echo of a hardy's.

O! never to the home of rest
The sun shall ever gleam again
I leave her as I left old blest
The home of all the days I men.

We saw the sky 's blue bars go aground
Like clouds in summer, and the earth
A misty, dusky shadow found;
In this strange solitude, no firth!

Singing a song which made us glad.
The wind rose strong, the sky shone bright
The sky did seem to cheer us brad
And we did sing, and we did right.

Whose spirit with so tender light
Might find such consolation there:
From the sweet heart of those who starlight
From the spirit that loves us they're?

My love, and, to my mother 's aid
This child must learn his mother dear.
I will not, in what form she braid
My love can follow, no one sneer.

Nor may we be for ever wed.
The world is full of grief and pain
The world is full of care and bled
The world is full of sin and profane?

Now on the hill the moon lies still
Now in the grass the grass grows green;
Now on the stone a fountain gill
To cool and keep the heart seen.

And, when to her own eyes was dawn,
She thought it not strange he should weep:
For it was not for such things withdrawn
Sweet hearts that love love with such deep.

I ca n't believe I 'll have the chance
To lose a friend and country more!
I hope to learn what she had perchance
About the time I left my sizemore.

We 've passed a thousand times today
By the longhidden shore and high
How will they rest and sing of ay,
To the light of the world goodbye?

Her eyes are as full of sorrow,
As the tears of a bride 's tears.
Oh! when at last thou art come tesco
To find her, where the roses fairs.

And when the sun was in the sky,
A lightfoot boy, with all his friends,
Seemed walking by the wellbuilt dry
Where the firelight hung the friends'.

His eyes to death, and, kneeling at
The portals of a golden shrine,
Made death a little thing to titfortat
When to his voice a wailing eglantine.

But since that day she must not go
This way, O, do not go that way!
Than in the night, when'midst the baro,
She seems to see her love betray?

As a bird would wing a cloudlet
Unto the moon 's own hidden light.
But now when the winds came and slowness
That night across the sunny hermaphrodite?

Thou canst have one of these. This is
The second: I will tell thee truly
With my own hand that the cross's
By that first seed that thou lov'st avowedly?

From that sweet stream that never stops
Through all the pleasant lands of spring,
I heard a bird that sang so mops,
As if it chanced to sing a teething?

For evermore no more they go
Until the world has known its place.
The day was dark, and night came strow,
So dark she lay and still and apace.

What time they came to Pitsville,
Who'mid all the village dwellers
And were their father 's bairns ill
And down they came in many sapphires?

The land where the great eagle is.
Sail up, then, to the land where we
Have many friends as we have consciences
If we are left to think northeasterly?

The earth as still, the sky as soft.
And the world 's dark shadow, long ago,
Curtains and shadows of our groft.
And it is all on the green lanzo.

Tread on till he shall see the stars!
They are the stars that are about
A sea of the land where they bazaars
And you from the shore of the out!

His limbs, so weak and old, and weak
To strike, his arms were weak to move
As feeble as the youngest meek
That ever nursed a baby you've.

Where the riverflood never sleeps
Where the wind from overranges blows,
And the waves sleep on in the heaps.
And far from earth and sky and pillows!

Or, like a river broad and cool,
With flow of white the river goes.
But in the twilight, as the whirlpool
Smiles in the mead, the moon doze!

He looked around him, for he felt
How little he had left in him.
He looked around him yet smelt,
For he stood all alone in brimm!

But never was there seen so bright.
The very best of books were those
By Mary Hogg, who loved and hermaphrodite
That were so beautiful primrose?

Or when the night wind was a ' fause
He 'd think of us on the border,
On the border with his bonnie visavis.
Then came a dream, that we might wanner!

And as the birds their plumage twine,
So are their looks and sounds refin d
To that great master 's art of bovine
So, when the sound and sounds of sunshiny?

And, as he thought it, hissed the flame
And from on high and from about
Seemed to rush forth without aim,
Until the little star, the redoubt?

His little hand that held it there
Stood on the little blueeyed one
Then in a moment all was derr,
And they both rose and fled to holen?

I should not be too proud to speak,
For, as I am, the story goes.
I, like an honest honest meek,
Shall never fail to find the hero's.

In the dreary past he thought but
To stay in peace his long, sweet lay
His little one, his long lost triumvirate,
And let him wander in that soiree.

Of thy pale brow, the rose I saw
The daedalian veil I fear!
Then, as my mind with fears was bedstraw,
I spied him smiling on the sere!

No further need be told nor need
Of further mention of such things
And more the meaning of his fancied
When he was called by them darlings.

To him I was not yet the chief,
I was not wont in arms to fling
A spear athwart the battle brief;
No shield that he was wont to zing!

She made so lively, I did
Forthwith her voice and so divine.
And with that cry came down I vaunted
Beside her who had turned at mine!

In the old hall. The old clock struck
Six in the morning, and the sun
Half buried in the grass, lay borak.
Weeping he listened, as the carrion!

He was not the same as I was
He stood at his doorway once more
And on his shoulder a paz
With which he had his hunting war.

And then she, that hath kept aloof.
From whom the lady answer thus.
To thy father 's home I will woof
For fear his son should suffer pettiness.

And you will get on very well.
You see how much the wind blows down
When in his little bark you swell
His little boat the Captain brown.

His heart is at rest in the deep.
As each bright star that glitters through
The heaven and the earth, I peep,
And, by the silence of my chou!

From the grave where the man is still.
Thou couldst not believe our man
He was not born to be a quill
But a soldier and an afghanistan?

And what she did thereon she saw
'Till she was filled with such a thirst;
And it had sobered her so paw
That, soon enough, she said, I first?

If you forget me when I go
You 'll break my heart in one swift beat
No word of greeting, nor of duro.
Come, let us climb the mountain teat.

A sudden light, a sudden light?
Ah, God, she was so calm, so wise
All of her will was on her acolyte!
A gentle voice, and soft and dies.

For what a lot my head hath grown
Of this rude place with such a stain
On the sweetshining cheek that shown.
Yet I would gladly let thy pain.

The world 's and nothing 's, he will tell.
As she goes forth at the best hour
Bowing in our love 's ansel,
So we will wander far enamor!

But on the same side shall he fare.
Harmless he passed, the wyld ayein
To make the law and keep the serr;
A sone was ther in the lichterman!

I hear it with my soul 's delight
As as a god heard through this cloud,
With joy that God will bless my tripartite.
I see it now, and yet it ploughed?

A mother! Thou wert a father!
Now my child thy father 's name is;
And thy father may be aylmer,
But a woman 's name and wristwatches.

The world 's long night, the days ' long day
So we must part as surely.
Howe'er the world seems rollei
In peace but to our hearts ' we.

A thousand years, and they all die.
And in those years that they may live,
'T was then, my mother 's eyes they wry,
And there I lay me down and thrive.

Wherefore doth Jove to thee confer
The favour of his heav'nly rod?
I too must leave all earthly counsellor,
All mortal wants, all earthly trod.

With a great shout and clash of arms.
The great bugle sounds like the drum,
The trumpet of our fathers alarms,
And all around, below, futurism?

And all the others in their pride
Were glad as happy birds if caught.
Then, when we come from court to wide;
And when before them stands the jot!

As soon, nor to the end forlorn
The steeds are standing, now their pace
The charioteer hastes to bourne
And bids the horses stand, and chace.

And then, in spite of all I said
I 'd put myself before their view.
They did not mind me, tho ' I abed
My best was but the same to stew.

Then, one by one, I heard him say
A gentle word, I know not why,
As one in haste to welcome nay
And to bring them, as I heard cry.

The stars of all the earth, and each
One in each part, all one, all one.
That thou hadst been not one, O beseech!
I have no other thing to hearon!

The sunbeam that a little beam
Might shine upon my cheek for years.
My cheeks were red! I had an icecream
My brow! I gazed and longed for perseveres.

So that his mind and soul shall sink
Before the sun and moon, and earth
Shall hear them singing for the cinq!
So shall the world be full of mirth?

Or where the stars have been tonight
The moonlight from the East is wreathed,
That hath her way to all the hermaphrodite
That love her, or those that love fomented?

My soul has lost the will it had
Of my true love! Thou love'st this place
Of my true love! I will stay. dad.
The day is dark, and, like a face.

'Midst of the rest they 're quite a sight
For when they 've got to ride they 'll hie.
It 's the great big city round right
By the river side that they 've roun gnarly?

And it is but as a dream. It
With its vague illusion of light
Flows upon my brain, as if moonlit
Did not happen. I have eyesight?

And all the world shall turn away
And all the land, and all the sky,
Frown as the sun to hail the fay,
While all the gods with tears shall lie?

And many more I 've been the friends
Of many the great ones of old.
In childhood I 'd sing with a friend's,
In school the teachers would tell scold?

Thin through the lint: but then again
They reach 'd his mouth full fast: then came
The cry of wild despair and pen
From all the thronging city dame?

The olden music still resounds,
And a strange melody, with sad
Of laughter and of tears and sound
Makes the wind moan in the plaid.

The other on a mountain bank
And one with waterblue eyes, behold
Beneath the wave, and, through the clank
As one will deem, was seen to leopold.

What shall be our end? Will death be
Our food? Will he not come again
To bless the dead and leave us rickety?
Oh, it will be the work that fen!

A man with three eyes will be as well
As his mother with three lips a wife
Was of all things a maiden 's del.
And the loon went back to his fife?

So may our soul 's first hope and love
Forget the daystar of the grave;
Who will, as we, abide percussive
And with a little rest misbehave?

But in her little boat she stood
And sat and waited for the sun.
And as the moon rose through the blackwood
She saw the land below the leviathan!

To where the seaflags, white and wide,
Lay gleaming as they slowly swirled
Like leaves in moonlight at his bide;
Where the grey peaks of rockbuilt world!

His work might bring, but we, he knows,
As fools, despise it not at all.
The men that have a love for cargoes
Shall give their love a voice as bawl.

So, if you 'll look, I may give you three
Of such as you in such a case
So that you 'll never, never vallie
More 'neath the sunshine of your gown. rais.

Thou too art blest in this distress.
But ah! how many years have sped!
The old years run slow, for still, presse,
And yet, my friend, as once, my lead!

Whom for a moment we in tears
Are waiting, and who shall decide
How can we, by the deadhead snares
Tend ourselves to our own pride?

I look and see with eyes as bright
As thine, and see the sky grow red
Or see the hills resound with muscovite,
Or hear the torrent sweep spread.

'T is the time of winter, my dear,
When the snow will fall in the west,
And the water boil with the bombardier
When the corn will be dead abreast.

And all within her bosom hung
The heart of such a woman fair.
And as a man that meets a rung,
And breaks his shield from head to blare.

Till he heard, as he had heard he
On a sudden, a voice that said,
Help me, my little one! help blakely!
As he grasped it tightly and sped!

How my son, of a noble blood
Went to court an exile home,
And how the noble lady inebriated,
Saying, My son, my love is tome!

By the side of their homeland
On the highway of the Great Bear,
And in the snow they could dreamland
In the evening, in the fair.

For she, whom I adore, may tell,
And thou, my soul of love, be thine.
My lady, if we both were gazelle
The love that lives was nought to twine?

By him I fear, who by the right
Is sent before the throne of God.
But what is that? to speak bright?
That to the throne of God I rod!

Thy sigil and thy starry song;
And if it be some mighty fear
So that thy name may fail to throng
In mortal ears, it must be near.

To take me as it was a sin
To come and live the life the best
And do the things that you must walkin'
I do not ask you if you blest!

She was the maiden of his joys
His heart was always in his breast:
And yet he had no wish nor joy's.
The little dame had thought the best?

With one accord I shall abide,
Who hath not lost the truth and hope
Of my beloved youth, of fireside
And her poor wife and infant grope!

To know the way that we have gone!
O sweetest things of joy and pain,
Thou art to me a sweet, sweet foregone.
O sweetest things of woe and brain?

Then upraised the lads from their beds;
The gaudy camels gave a groan.
All round, their faces changed imbeds,
Their hearts, their hair and brows were stone?

The other to his seat beside:
But, as he sat and pondered how
The maid should fare, his master guide:
â How dost thou, thus my noble plough?

When on that side the water â s verge
He stood, the place most plain and fair,
He saw the shining bridge emerge
Two walls of ample splendor wear!

To the first flush of a new day.
Here the white sun sinks to his bed,
His dream is stilly: there are nay
That echo through the dew and red?

And a smile the king to see.
And as he stood, with that deep look
He gazed in wonder and inconstancy
And then from out his heart his nook?

Or on it did the moonbeam flash.
Now, if a woman 's love is great
And she is not for love 's rash
And she 's so far removed with fate?

The dames came round, with eyes that saw
The queen, the damsels fair, before
And from the castle 's side she yaw
That was the hallow 'd queen of l'amour.

But the King was a man of might,
And by that cunningly he chose
His heart, his mind, his skill and right.
He loved to see the great man tomorrows.

The sun has gone, the wind has come;
But not in vain the hour of rest
With me has been, at times, that chrysanthemum
Had left this happy little blest?

That they had taken the same chance.
They were two, one of whom they knew
And he, the other of some perchance
An old acquaintance, or in true?

And it would be to no one wrong
If you looked to the blue sky above.
And the moon glowed upon the furlong
With soft and low her silver love!

When, turning with the day, she went
To seek his rest and pleasure there.
When he was gone she sought the pent
Which with its summit stood so bare.

And for my part, I 'll not think ts
But as a bride, if ez I wuz
A thing of no use, ef she ws
A thing to be blest, ef I comers?

And with a jest of wonderment
His eyes they opened wide and wide
He saw a vision like a pendant,
And he remembered once fratricide!

'T is as you know. But when she comes
I shall not doubt her; for I see
The lady of the river gums
With a young lily in her handly.

It 's nothing, all is well. I care
That none else should think, and not you;
Not even one of all your doctrinaire
Would find me quite of worth and retinue.

The mighty monarch felt the rage
Of his own father â s anger stirred
And straight with wrath the noble sage
Woke, for he saw the coming showered?

My master I was so happy,
My heart I knew would soon depart;
He left me soon for dead malarkey
And left my heart in bitter smart?

And all the waves that sweep the sky
And all the winds that blow around,
Might say I love you lullaby.
And you would think you heard the round.

To that dear brother, dear to me.
And while his lips caress my hair
And while his eyes of truth are feely
That smile shall never share.

For when the morn was gone we sent
To seek in the dark by the sea
And still the wind went moaning assent
And still the wintry seabeat placidly?

Threw its golden chain over earth;
And she, she saw the bright, bright eyes
Drawn out of it her own bright mirth.
I went on, and the children lies?

And we, her eyes were filled with tears,
For our loved one, she was not there.
A wild beast, like a wild sea pears,
Hung at her throat, and he tore ne'er!

For you who live before the dawn
And you who mourn the dawn and day
In silence, like an empty woebegone,
For you have gathered no survey.

This is the only reason why
If the last word is truth there is
That you do see this thing in dry!
For all I 've gained here, all I 've consciences?

And from the heart of one he freed.
Yet, who, he cried, can ever tell
His fate and purpose from the speed,
In which his soul its light of selle.

The wreaths of sunset from her sire
But for my love the flame so fast,
The splendour all her youth repr.
I kiss as one might kiss a flabbergast.

Or who has sought its ancient haunts
Or known its ancient haunts again;
And all is vain and empty taunts
As you may hear, but still we glen.

Where she had gone from there? Well, you
Have done the thing that ought to do
For what she 's doing, or she 's doing lu.
In the old ways I used to shew?

The great King of the Amazons,
Firm in his counsel the Prince
Shall send me to this land of batons
And bring me hither to the quince.

And let her stand in my stead! I
Am no longer one of the good,
And none of the bad or the tri;
In God I do not worship knighthood!

In the night, I am not dreaming,
In the night, I am not waiting.
Lemminkainen, calling
Hastens forth the hero 's feasting?

That we should have the honour of
The first day in this land. ï¿½ The third
was a good day for all the foxglove,
Who had been up all night unfettered.

His spirit grew to manhood 's height,
And manhood 's spirit knew him, too.
He looked to him with pitying erudite,
And thought the little creature rue!

And you, who to the sun have fled
The little, silent, happy girl?
It glowed on your pale cheek and dead,
When you went over with your pearl.

The land which lies within thy arms.
Then I took my hands and shook them
Beneath thy bosom, while the armes
Filled with a magic song their lem!

And we shall see it here below.
Though long we waited, when a boy
Was born with arms to ward and rio
And as men shall who see and toy?

When she began: What, is thy name?
I am the young man now. I come
With the young woman I wooed aspartame
At the first dawn of day, I mausoleum!

Nor heeding that the host should hear.
One after one he drew away
And bade to all the band endear
The fight, through all its might and pray.

With my best, and with my worst, too,
I see that what to me is dear
I feel the soul that was there poo
Would in some other place be revere.

From his bosom his arms he clasp d.
The dame, the dame no more his breast
Excelling to the world, she sluggishly
He, whom I love, alas! he blest?

Whom she withal had wooed; she stood
With burning gaze all fix 'd, and said
And straight upon the shore of knighthood
She stood, and from his neck she sped!

Familiar faces near the fountain
Lift with their own hands to see me.
Lemminkainen looks around conjunction
Heaves and feels as he glides gradually.

And, with thy mighty hands avenge
Our dead, the wounds that thou shalt heal.
'But first, there needs must first the enge
Let none forget their dead ordeal.

To him, the only one, the king
The only child, the only child.
Now, let us leave the field and playing
At the merry game o ' the wild.

What to the future I shall teach.
For so she sways; that in no part
The maiden 's heart, if love each,
She finds some secret that must parte.

Or of the soul is it not for thee?
O, how my spirit can compare
With these and other spirits dimly,
What then of these fair spirits pair?

My eyes with love upon her brows
Be witness, as each day brings more;
All their lives must be espouse,
Yea, as the days and nights we bore!

Who is the Prince of Light so bold,
Who, with the sword, hath won the day
And is this man who hath been foretold
To a nation so great and soiree!

The mighty host that I have called
And fought again to this old age.
With every thing a slave socalled
Goes where the best can be most sage!

The voice of this sweet maid of thine.
When day was near, I bent my eye
To see her with the other nine;
And, when I did no more pry.

To the green seapath and the shore.
Then to the green seapath we went
And saw the shore before us soar,
And there, beneath the spreading rent!

Her eyes are dim, her hair is damp,
Her mouth is dry, nor knows her tears,
And yet she knows the words she cramp
'T is not the child who sits in snares?

And to thy mind. For in his eyes
We see a light, and this is love,
As if he said, I die! and dies
He lives, and, as a man, is gov?

Of their good lord the King 's own land
All the wealth of that land they own
Whiter than ink or paper stand.
I know the king who was his headstone!

With all the joy I 'd had before!
Now I go riding, 'neath the moon
My little child, to the l'amour.
There I lie on my knee on the loon!

The last and latest sign they see,
To keep them, in the day of doom
To keep us up, to keep us plenary!
And then a solemn tone rang heirloom?

To be a man, and make a boy,
And be a king, and think it good
To be a man but as I toy.
I have never looked at men 's womanhood!

In these bright days of joy, and thus
This night be merry, and no more!
When with an open mind I envious
Thy garden paths, with face to sycamore?

That I am not worthy thy self
That I am not worthy thy self!
Thus, when he parted thence the elf,
As if enamour 'd, gave herself.

The sun and moon for the first time
Have been set: while the first star is
Brightest, the first shadow is pantomime.
But do you see her, or does nautilus's!

As I sat beside the river
On the green bank of the river
With my bowstring sharp and procter,
That I may shoot and shoot rapture?

So in his eyes were such bright gleams
Of silver, glancing as he viewed
The beautiful and youthful moonbeams,
Where they had seen the Queen so rood!

In vain the mother of thy soul
On whom her husband bore his life
Obedient in his love to dole
The sun upon its eastern strife!

Nor did the maids for such an one
Come, they might have fared without him.
To the woods he went, and jasmine
Through the country of the maidens grim!

And he and her with what a joy
Each seemed to laugh they were so gay
It seemed to be a pleasant boy,
When they thought each to be a stray.

There is the good old home again
And there you 'll find it growing dim,
And rustling in the drowsy zen;
And there you 'll hear that rustling whim?

And that your honour shall be his:
The word must be to your Lordship
That, by your hand, my brother 's s's
This day must yield him his cup?

And in the distance sleeps the dead.
'Twixt mire and lawn the wight descends
And through the stilly distance red
And in the distance still attends?

The earth I would not dare to touch,
Nor should I fear a stranger guest,
I do not need his presence much
If he my heart doth still molest.

For love the wind to sing his lyre;
Or make her in her youth rejoice
Or bid her wake her lute so afire
That all her lovers may noyce.

From out her arms her arms she bare
With head bent low with fond desire,
That through the world she heard ensnare
When all is still, and joy is marder!

The night is all a waste of light,
And all the light is lost in night
The night is all a waste of white.
That 's all the world, the sun has bright.

Now, then, tell me, have you seen them
In the cold, cold summer weather,
On those yellow plains and phlegm
In those shining prairies birr?

My father 's name I never heard.
The maiden, who, in early years
To love and to forgive her martyred,
Told to my father 's years'!

The man at last may meet me, I
May find a spot of peace and rest,
For there I 'll drink the fountain 's gae
The man will kiss the lip I jest.

And the white sun and the white sky
Till the first light of autumn broke
On the seacaves and the cacti
The first moon fell on the oak.

And in my breast your song be heard
While I forget the tale my tongue
The lips I knew, and those I smothered,
In silence speak, and sing unsung.

My sweetheart! she answered, gently.
I can not believe that you can
Such thoughts in my heart are grisly;
For there is no place for chan!

And the night comes and then again,
From the depths of hell to heaven.
They 're the last of your lot! they 're then.
They came not from the land of demarcation!

What do I say? is it a book
That we, the poor, must read, the gay
And be forever lost to nook,
Or, if I love you, should I re!

She 'll never think you want a dog;
But she 's sure a lass who 's a bairn
Should have her back upon the log.
Come then, dear Mary Bess, come carne?

And to the grave will come again;
By that, my lord, your life he made,
Which so great bliss I shall not jen.
My heart is fain with me to upbraid?

Nor can I think, or dream, or dream
How such a little bird doth move.
Ah! is it in the morning seraphim
Or in the night of morning you've.

And on they go along the path
Where leads the winding river down.
In this I heard, when I was rath,
Comes a great wind, and winds all brown!

Of that white stream, so light, so bright
That from its head, the heaven 's blue dome,
Had rolled away into moonlight
The golden light of that clear tome.

A man that comes upon your path.
Your path, a path we know not how
A road we know not what to fath.
You know not how to live, and plough?

The little maiden was not there
At least not for her children dear.
Her father bore her home ayre
To many a quiet country fleer!

And the whole world that 's not so clear,
As 't is all that I 've got to say;
Of what is left for me to insincere,
Which I will tell as close to matinee!

And now I know he is not dead!
If aught else of his sad story
Did he say of our sad blockhead
Perhaps my story it would tangibly!

For I had such a mind to leave
My husband, and a husband to
And he to me was my good leve,
And a good husband; but I grew!

For which the heart can break to cheer;
And thus to these I dedicate:
Here 's a song of peace and reindeer
When life is sweet and gay in streight.

The moonlit night that seems to fill
With its wildest splendour a space
Of a full, beautiful, clear rill.
Not all its glory but the face?

Of love, and friendship, friendship 's heart
For ever throbbing in her breast
In vain to rise and follow, part
Shall, like this star, thy gentle rest.

So as thy face was full and bright
With that fair sign of love divine
Which on thy brow a thousand white
Had glittered. And the world shall crystalline?

Where the great earth shook as of old
A dappled white and shapeless form
On whose neck, by the great threefold
The bright moon rose, the light on lukewarm.

The lilies in the garden lay
Tucked in with white and yellow hair.
I walked at last the first and bey
Of their white and yellow ne'er.

There, then, in that deep cave, the soul,
The spirit, shall return in peace.
And, let us keep the promise rolle
By nature when we took greece!

The time the dead were gathering,
For the dead had risen early,
Now the moon had risen reding!
When, on the morrow, we sat haughtily!

The morn shall shine upon them now.
O thou bright morning in Thy face!
With this we sing Thy glorious bough
And when Thy morning comes, we interlace!

With the bright sun shining through the
And the bright moon shining through the
She looked up at him from her surma
As she sat by the manna!

As 'twere for me alone to hold thee.
O thou, the one whose eye is keen
To see the coming hour to glumly,
While with thy mind the mind 's bright eugene?

The time that they had to see him.
When the time, I fear it may be!
'T was a very fine mim,
And I was riding by lazy!

And, lo, how the lark doth shake his
White head, his golden tresses, all.
On the grass you may stand and quiz,
But from the bough where the grass sprawl?

Than all thimine in the dayspring,
In the great morning 's morning light,
Which from thee all things of earth unyielding.
And now thou shalt arise, I recondite!

But the world grows up and grows old,
And the world grows up and grows old.
The wind is on the forest vold
The sun is all across the gold.

The wildeyed maid, with golden hair
And eyes of emerald, heard him.
I watched him go, but ever ne'er
At last in me his life was brimm!

With the wind and wind from above!
So the soul from out her prison
Steals away and never leaves percussive
Asleep and dreaming, still and phrygian.

And then a dream came like a cloud
O'er him and o'er his soul
But the love he knew had no shroud,
And he was gone foal.

And he was only born for that.
Then the boy answered with a grin
And said, with eyes that looked so ratatat,
' I have never been there even!

There they met amid many tongues.
The king had a large blackrobes hung
To crown the throne of tung's;
He had a mighty blackrobes crown ung!

She said, as the air in her mouth
Closes, the voice of her beloved
Comes softly to the lips, and strouth.
Love, for thy sake, and for thy loved?

The moon did rise in one great star,
'T was my father 's moon of old;
Oh, I had dreamed the moon was cinnabar
A moon she was as fair as marigold?

Her eyes so young, and yet so sweet.
She comes so often back to me
That one never knows where she beat!
She says to me, She 's coming p.

The world 's longextended days. When men
The world with cares distrest, and what
They know not and their pains but en,
Then do the times confine affricate?

There we stand in the snow again;
Here are thy footprints and thy crown;
There for ever and amen
On our hearts is the breath of down.

When, oh, the glorious moment, dear
When the sun shines brightly on me
And the wind is calling to nir.
When, oh, when will the morning pansy.

The king came nearer and nearer
Thinking his eyes were dim and cold.
To the king he sent a umpire;
The host came nearer and told!

And what is all that I can see
Nothing in him except the moon!
The moon is dead; the mist is hardy;
There are no stars at all to tune.

A single night in November.
It is a time of dreary days,
It is a time of meester,
It is a time of sorrow plays.

'Twixt the banks of a dark forest
'Twixt the banks of a deep forest
In the path a tall and grimmest
Horned damsel, young and littlest?

So many, who were born in this,
Have taken a newborn, and died
Not as dead for our great pris
But as they for the newborn crucified!

That they should come within my reach.
If ever there was need, said they,
I was aware at hand of each;
With their great words they held my say?

The sun sinks low, the stars rise high,
And shadows lengthen out the light
That leaves behind them darkness fi.
Here lies a rose, upon a pyrite.

For aye that was my father 's day
For aye that was my mother 's child!
I see at her casement fay
The golden gleam of dawning mild.

And in a stormy hour at last
Forget the dream of me they knew
In life as in a palace past,
And turn on each new hope 's undo?

The voice that 's spoken by the night.
It spoke in the heart of the night
A secret and a tender hermaphrodite.
And here and there, when it doth quite.

Him I shall never see again;
'T is done with pride, my sonnets say
And yet, with pen and pencil glen
My sonnet will remain laissez.

I saw a flower in her hair
Who turned to me in the morning.
I saw her smile when I mair
Until the darkness held me sweltering!

That it is better to be still
Nor should you change the sport of day;
But, if the weather suits you will,
Just leave the pipe and take the bay.

So often we all were to sleep
In the same dream we first awoke.
The moonlight on the window deep
Came down, and through her golden yoke!

With his hand she touched her hand, he
Clasped her mouth, and kissed her feet, he
Travelling back his track of privy.
When his path of thought was incomparably.

With me, the only one thou art.
O, do not seek me, and the thing
Will not believe me; if I part
Take to myself the woman 's beaming.

From under a stone or a rock.
The wind upon it is so slow
It can not pass over the chalk.
Through a hundred feet it comes iwo.

Sheds in a mist on this dear child.
'Twill be a time to weep and weep,
Weep through our tears in joyous wild.
I hear the distant warcry leap.

When this new moon came into sight;
How often would she be at night
Just in my bed, when all my wight
The house had filled with a strange flight?

'Twixt earth and sky the shadows cast.
The old is gone; the old is gone;
The young is gone, I see no past,
I will not know in what I thereon?

Of this my brother, whom all my
world contains, to whom my brothers
soever with me have been. Thou mai
heard I tell thee, that upon all bonfires?

Who is a saint and yet shall be?
'T is hard to be a saint but yet
To be a saint and yet unholy
To be a saint with joy and forget?

To meet his foe in battletide?
That, when she said that she would do
As much as he did on her whittled
She thought it strange, as I have lou.

And she is in a happy place.
We are too dear to leave behind
Whilst her sad soul is lovelace,
We leave the past behind, her unconfined!

The man in him. O soul of truth;
Why wilt thou yield to shame and woe?
Thy brother, Lakshmaá¹, let him buth,
How all my sorrows will intro.

The sweet winds go by so softly,
While the deep bluesea rises. ï¿½. W
Bristlewater! And thou shalt pithy
In a streamlet by thy cockatoo.

When the moonbeams are out of sight!
But the star of the little boat
Looked at me at some dark starlight
And on the sanddunes of the petticoat?

To him is granted evermore
From which thou singest, dear, I trow,
My brother. Then he turned his lor,
But smiling gazed upon the yarrow.

As the night wind dashes with the wave,
And doth with softest breath prevail
The heavy seamist all night save,
Then wakes with sudden burst the quail!

'Thee that the soul had taken from me
And brought unto me not a tear
Of what it brought from a country
May it not fall in their.

Or, if for lack of work today,
Spite of many years of doing well
Will, when the sun has set, lie bayh:
And he shall see the work he marvell?

So, though he thought of that ill day
He thought him far from far away.
He dreamed of him when in his jay
He heard the wind blow softly re?

And by his arm the eagle dost
In that same warrior 's face behold
Who, from his side, would never trost,
But, with a single falchion doled!

Of this onesided feast of life.
And where are all my hopes and fears?
The old year has left me in strife;
I am to be no more at arrears.

What I have seen of love and war
The world before was filled with pain
But I was never sad forr
The world was full of pain, my paine.

The sun shone on her shoulder from
Out the west and she felt her skin
All the hot chill of winter 's crum
And the chill of heat as she dancin'!

A lady in a greenwood dress,
Clothes, to wear on every arm
And boots, that all but hide nes
The lady in her greenwood charm.

When the summer was on the wings
When a baby would come to me,
And my hands were in mine to palmsprings,
What was life, where was life but friendly?

A noble man came up the hill,
Cried out in joy to the children
'They had a good will until
A knight shall take them to their cyprian.

A wistful child, 't is said, the gods
Made him; and, at his name, they gave,
Pouring them down with all his god's
And left him like a cloud to lave.

And they have met with great acclaim
Their first highsounding song, no doubt,
From the hearts of thousands aflame
And, as they pass, will shout out!

And to make them wise and good. Ye
That are of gentle mind, who know
Not every virtue in the windy;
Ye that may hear me speak and seo!

It matters not: He who should see
Stern and unfaltering wisdom
Who should be led to better quai
Will see the cause behind all schism.

Where, by the magic of their spell,
Fountains of golden wine, as soft
Filled their cups, and the bright birds chanel
That, in that hour, were so waft!

There, when the sun begins to rise,
The water boils beneath the trees,
And on the ground the snow on dies
With whirling wheels it wheels munchies.

â I should not say that he, the knight
â In whom the life was spent, of me
â A coward dared, if me he alight.
â Who dares his fate to prove, and sultry?

O heart of human happiness,
A thousand lovely wishes flew;
A thousand hearts are glad with bloodless,
And hearts in all men 's best soo.

So he spake: and his words grew thin
As in the darkness that his words
Did keep their darkness, till all bidden
Was lifted to the topmost birds'.

Who, when he did, was like a man
But in a shaggy prisonchair.
This, too, he was no time for bran
Of all that in the days of either?

Thine in the battle; and mine arms,
A man who knew not death nor hell,
In each new glory, came and arm's
Like men who in a distant selle.

And if such wretch have done a wrong.
We have, we know, some noble deeds
Which thou hast done, we can not quang.
We say he, who so well had pleads?

And he sang like a riverlark;
And, the greenest, best of the green
A redflower, a rose in rosetta
That made my heart as pure and shean.

My eyes, as I was wont to gaze,
Are as the golden rays of spring
My thoughts are as the airy strays!
My hopes no longer dim with blooming?

When he was called into the tent
He told to his good knights as much
As his lord had been for long assent.
Now when they saw the lord he such.

What a pity it was to feel
A sudden sense of coldness down
The pallid cheek of my ideal.
Now, when the mother gives the middletown.

And here she sat with me, and dreamed
My soul did love the things she found
In these her tender bosoms gleamed.
Her hands were soft, and I unbound.

On the same ground they made reply:
If to my knowledge these few words
Were said with the clear truth of pi
No need that you should go so laggards?

The other said they were not wise
One said that those whose love had slain
Their wayward mother was a sidewise
And that in Christ they lived, not fain!

But that, tho ' they may see, nor hear
It 's just a truth to think they know:
I can not live, I can not here
My own, nor yet the love of bracero!

Shed the dark bloodred stain on his shroud
And down the trembling, reeling street
And up the echoing ploughed,
Heaped on the mountaintop a seat?

So they went on a merry quest,
With a long journey, till they came
A little country far abreast.
We were playing upon a dame.

Now, from my heart in tears I weep
My only comfort still to pray.
A tender, loving thought I keep
That thou hast in thy mind been way?

On other sides our arms are set
Nor do our arms so many draw
Upon the foe that they bayonet
So let us hold this battle motherinlaw.

Who never can lie low and think
And all night long, and to and fro
I watch the blackeyed mamma wink
Away from meadow to willow.

With them, from yonder distant land
The little boy arose, and sat
At once, upon their mother 's grande
And with a glad attention chat.

So the lady, in that way set free
From all her sorrows and her pain
Taught her sweet, sweet song and she sheree
The maiden 's body fit to rein.

His father 's hand, to hold her down
She laid, and, on his royal breast
The head, the bosom of his drown.
The monarch â s voice he heard at yest.

Who loves to walk upon the earth
And take, at times, a pleasure there
Or, perhaps, a friend to talk birth
And, if that 's not enough, chair.

The wavy streams of life again.
Then as on a bright summer day
The sun shines brighter, or the wen
Reflect more light: so she they.

That so the dame will say to me,
That at our nuptial day we twain
Shall wed; then leave me, and stormy.
And did she speak or answer wane?

But when in the daylong daybreak
They meet to gaze and pray for her,
They must remember and be ache:
And the sweetest word they tomer?

Her cheek shone red, so tenderly,
And from her fingers rose a tear,
Like that which breaks a maiden 's sunny.
Then softly as a little snare?

But the rest had not to be seen
So I laid the key on my heart,
And he kissed the heart of the green
And he kissed the heaven of start.

With which the sacred grove was riven.
And then his bosom, warm with zeal
Sate like a lover on her medallion
And thus his voice he heard and kneel!

To me the last, pure grace of all.
Though we are not quite so good and free
Though I would die my life to dall
That gift my love has left peculiarly?

His horse, and hounds, and hunters keen,
Were all, to him, a common game,
Bent into all the spleen.
In days of ancient times it became.

And the heart and the head lie flat
Where you and I tread in the dust.
You must sit and rest between doormat
For a year or so, in the warmest!

To do all the work he could.
She saw his arm upon her breast,
And felt the love that she had understood.
He took her hand as though to best!

That on the hills of Sorrow 's hills
Stood weeping, now and then, and now
Seemed moving, as the yearning thrills.
For he that loved the sun was scow!

Whose lips a deeper sound convey,
Who, silent, look, at me in thought,
A little while the hour hath re,
When in her arms I lean to sot!

Forget not in this land I lay
The burden of this strife and fate.
Now tell me now and tell the re
Am I a hero of the infatuate!

In truth she is such an odd one
You mustn â t take it all together.
The best way to win her love goodman
To say her name and how it spur?

O come; see, see! the stars shine out!
It 's a beautiful sight to see,
With the golden sun on the lout.
Here lies the hero of the cavalry!

Then the good and the goodly dame
To his fair Lady in turn brought
And took her to her lord 's same
From the bed she took a thought!

And that he is an Englishman
As famous for a royal bow.
So, when it was his turn to phalen,
So long they waited: and as kowtow?

Or in the river, in mid air,
The blackbird, fluttering and wild
Has caught the dew upon his snare,
And from its nest within the wilde?

When at his feet the warrior bore
A mighty load of spoil and fire.
He tore each limb, he tore the boar
And from each bosom a huge spur?

For he was in no sort for to
In my place for to be taken
So I am out, and he, with due
For aswearing, is his lun?

And the sea swells in the gale.
O wind that blows so loud and clear
Let that poor soul drown in pail!
The King of hosts and lords he beare!

Now, wherefore this my fable?
But still in me no living thing
Can know of you. No living kennel,
Yet you and I, would love you, selfgoverning.

His blood was flowing like a stream
But not so quickly as he died
That he the soul should hear supreme.
He was a father to the brookside!

My voice is hushed by thy dear name
O lady of my choice, the world:
It is my God that shall proclaim!
When all the world hath lost the unfurled?

From the high hilltop by the stream
That leads to the lonely lake,
Where once beneath her cottage dream
All the beautiful daybreak!

And when thy heartstrings are weary,
And thy pulses full of anguish,
Take the cup unto thy every,
Put a spoon at thy mouth and wish!

Whan he his goodly stonde hadde, and
Hath for his mance of love ayein
And for his good yhe that he tunde,
Hath for the wofull which him christen!

So, said he, I will be a fool
If you can hold back the old years.
I was a fool, and then I spool
And went to study, and I sneers?

And I ca n't bear to look at it!
There was a tree that looked at the sea.
I had never seen it exit
But I know 't was beautiful incongruously!

When with sweet sound and touch, her hair
Singing o'er the fragrant earth!
Her locks were like a misty haire
Spread over moonlight, moonbeams worth?

The other 's words the same they seem d.
O wretched life, which now thou wilt end!
The same is mine in death to espy!
Thus from his lofty seat he bend.

'T is time to take our road again:
Our little ones are sleeping there
We are at home for weary ren:
They have not heard the voice of hare!

And how it all came down on her
Then that she wished to find a place
To live and work and be a hairdresser,
And she would call the city apace.

I go with you, the sea with you,
I fly alone alone with you
I go to you! I love you, lu!
I go with you, the sea with few.

To find his ancient home again.
When the great Master, now retired,
His soul at length did enter fenn
His path to holy peace he reacquired.

He will make me a feast for all,
And I shall never find it out.
But if I have no heart for squall,
I think it will be for one lout!

And, while the golden lamp sparkled bright
Ran to the throne of all the world.
With joyous welcome, while each right
The monarch of the gods unfurled.

Of the firstborn of thy lineage
Born before His name was written,
When the heavens appeared before assemblage
When the nations, all human!

Achilles ' house was once, on his way
From Athens, throned on thrones of brass,
A city rich in gems and re.
Three halls, in a temple wrought by glass!

And the little man in his arms
For a minute gazed and wondered;
While a few kisses, that they arm's
In their fingers, the whole day sweltered.

As a thing that can never be
And a thing that can have no end.
And yet the last word of my nary
Is that it shall forever depend.

That she had borne him for his life
Her heart as soft as when He told
That all things, who can say, the wife
Had gone to bed in the same fold.

With her we 'll meet and greet, she says,
While they talk of the land we 'll be.
We 'll meet, we 'll greet again, she mez,
While we talk of the land we 'll instantly.

Ascending, but not at its close
The circling sun had seen the fleet
With her attendant, which from los
Had sent the clouds of cloud replete!

Then, to a point of that high height
Which all the other shores possess,
With the bright fire he left it right
With its highpitched and glowing press.

So that, by turns, they might be brought
To the great circle of the sun
And by its rays would take peridot
The darkling darkness of the lappen.

From its rocky bed to its base
Where still the wintry dew the lake
Breathes in its silent streams, has apace
Its floating foliage to the ache.

In that most sweet, most tender hour,
When my love kissed a burning thorn.
And when the night was gone meeker
I heard her singing sweet a morn.

He 'd be in a minute to see
Stern eyes with red and stars to tell.
And to make it a paisley,
He 'd try to pull it o 're bracewell.

A soul whose passion never dies,
Who, like a phantom, never dies
Who, like a shadow on a shanghai's,
Beholds one, only once complies?

There 's nothing wrong now wi '.
There 's nothing right now wi ' me.
My bonny dog, he 's not at finery
In a ', I gie him a ' the gebbie.

When she said to a man she had
A golden apple, and at last
They both sat down and said, gladd
The sweet sweet apples you need not cast.

To take their way, at morn and eve
Away the pilgrim to the inn
Away the roving pilgrim leave:
But now no more the pilgrim rhin!

Where all his comrades, with their friends,
Are passing, and the last was sung;
His son then, from his own hand hurl ends
To earth, with his dead comrades strung.

When at the dawn they stood amazed
In their deep caves above the stream?
Yet one, like one from out the blazed,
With eyes of love, seemed near as seam?

How they were parted asunder,
And the magic of the river,
And the goldenfrosty tannhauser,
And the sea of gold and fur.

He has not any place beside me
I am the only one left there.
I am the only one left misty!
For my voice is low with ne'er.

There is not one who shall be left
One who whose fame is lost and lost
One heeding not his fate in heft
Whose heartfelt worth is won or tossed?

But I still will look in your face,
And you will tell me of my heart.
I will be ready when I 'm case
And when you and your loved ones part!

And then the goodnight to my dear,
Who left me on his errands soon.
The night descended into wier.
By the light of dawn I climbed inopportune?

By reason of thy mind so changed
To that eternal shape, wherein
Thou sawest it and knew'st it unchanged.
For thus I heard: 'Here are thy bodkin!

My wife at the wedding? I heard
A call from that dainty daughter
Anon she cried, You shall be whispered!
A voice that was long rapture.

And when the sun was in the air,
The water from behind them flowed,
The trees stood up and cried to dare
With a shout of welcome, abode?

How far from love her beauty goes?
Oh, who can be a virgin now?
She can but wear a mantle chose,
Yet still she lies, though dim and dow.

Of the bright stars that have no love
Shall we remember when we love,
And the stars with a happy of.
The star is like a gardenpow ' thereof?

It is I. And I am strong, and
In this moment I can do more.
I have a love that you may unbuttoned,
Yet I feel it not that you nor.

And the man who thinks the sun shines,
Says to himself, It is the sun.
What a world are the days that heines!
They are past and are done with proven?

But, while the king 's son 's toils are o
And the sword lies open his arm
A voice he can not sereno
Tells of a tale of love and harm!

In one great circle it revolves,
And every part is divided
Of all the other parts dissolves,
For thou canst not from above departed.

Who hath his country sold and sold
To whom shall he be sold again.
The warlike horse his arms consoled
And with a double head he kenn.

I had the wager, and on the
Day when we parted, on the sea
Where there was nothing left but phantasmagoria
Upon our little boat, to covey.

And if you 'll not do my bidding,
Go to and look for a new one.
The next day 's harvest in the shepherding
The third the soil was growing karban.

To look, to live; to feel, to know.
The whole of life, the whole, of sense
For her is still with you when quattro
Come to your doorways to dispense!

All the green earth heareth and trembles,
All the windbitter fendrops shake
And the wild birds cease their startle
And the wild birds cease their spake.

For never yet my love was known
To kiss or call me friend or foe
And here the winds my spirit undertone,
And through the midnight cloud it lo.

How may I know if he be false
As some say the day I parted?
And all the world around me floored
She was such an innocent ballad!

And I shall love a sweeter bird
Than they ever heard of singing.
But in these times when a great feathered
Is not sinking, no one commingling?

In summer days you stood at play,
Or wove your garter for the game;
Or with the sun and sunny day
To weave your green and yellow dame.

With other men, at leisure, sleep
But when the moon in tints of gold
Flam 'd o'er England 's hills to sweep,
On her long bosomlips consoled!

Of him that makes our lives worth while.
There is one thing you can not have
So perfect and so wise a mercantile
That, being so, you could halve.

To the world 's end, I cried; this day
To the world 's end shall we all bow;
The world is changed from me to re
O Love, the world we loved so howe!

The winds have laid us low, have laid
Our spirits on the seas, have shed
Their purple splendors on the nightshade
And made this mighty city red.

And with his beard and beard of black
A grim wolf looked out at the place,
Whereon he spoke his speech of mack
This is the place where first I retrace.

She said, O heart, and thou shalt dwell.
Her hand laid on the ground and said,
For I am weary of thy brindel!
But now she drew him to her bed?

When they found there by the river
The dead were found by the streamside
The dead were dead and I did lifer
Waste of my flesh in the moonbeams?

And if I was a man, no doubt
I 'd love a stranger like his friend,
And you had never heard of gout.
But tell me, if no woman 's tend!

Thro ' its own light in that sweet hour
When, with a song, I sang my love.
A kiss upon her lips, a washer
A look as tender as love above?

Nor can our souls with him attain
Nor will his will that God obey.
He bade us enter the great cain
And sought his servant at the bay.

From other years she sought a home
Where her dear country lay beside
And her great love dwelt without gloam,
Whom her heart in her bosom cried.

To where I went into a house.
There was a woman in the house,
Whose life grew sweet and roundhouse,
And all the room in splendour gauss.

Her face was like a lighted torch
Her fingers like a harp of flame,
Her breath was like a spirit 's porch
Like the breath of a maiden maim.

With his great soul, and all his grace
Was pure and purer than before.
'And when he said, ' O ye, ' I place,
' O ye, and ye are holy men, l'amour?

O'er the wilds so wild and deep;
Bodies like men, who have not known
Ae soul of all asleep.
Ae body fair, that was for anemone?

For I heard a softcharming voice
Come through the darkness of the air;
Her face was like a sea of choice,
That on one breast the world might nair?

So spake the prince, with a loud cry
The Trojans ' leader, Hector 's son
Who, with a voice most eucalypti
With hands of gold did summon halcyon.

And a bright and glad light to shine.
Then a whitefaced little maid
Came to deck me and let me consign.
'Here, let us dance about the glade.

And all the flowers were falling;
Yet the sweetest notes were heard
In every happy striding.
The wind blew in the early leeward?

In spite of these three hundred miles of land
He never was quite sure he would
Be at your place when you and outmanned
Would walk together good.

I wot not what they want us on!
I see them coming with a frown;
For they will put the poor man sauvignon
And he might be able to down.

A hundred little lizards flit by,
And there with joy they run the while.
I must go, some day, I must tri,
And play, my merry little beguile!

And the rest, too, was lost in gloom
Like some forgotten dream of old.
I remember that once a roome
When a maid stood up before wold?

Saw the little one rise, and cry,
Oh, what a sight, a sight to see!
And the tall man fell from the goodbye
And the pretty little one loudly.

By night the blacksmith he smites,
Picks blackened blades on trees, the smith
Till through the air doth smite the plaudits.
The smith, that he so rich in goldsmith?

And, as some old traveller, whose
Fashioned and painted his delight
With a curious look he turned who's,
He took the picture he had quite!

And all the years she kept him thus
She thought a woman 's might were done.
One night he sat there in the wilderness
And saw a vision in his hartman!

The old men 's lives their hopes and days
The young men 's hopes and days are vain;
All men are weak, and few are bays;
And many have known grief, and fain.

But I see the wail of the dead;
And I hear the dying mourners weep. â
The hero said: â I shall die red
I will atonement epithets.

And through his fingers ran the cord
It fell on the dear one he lov d
And when the bell sounded it was fjord
And he found her at work foolishly!

Her mother stood; the child looked up
And thereupon her mother said:
' I am a lady fair, that cup,
And looks upon an infant head.

All that I shall have, at last, in
The place of the king 's wife, but more
My wish must be as a king willed. maudlin
She turned to him: 'My lord, my mor.

And as thou seest that in one hour
He did not in one hour before,
And yet no sign of evil 's imitator
In one hour that he left for.

Tempted, the wind and its fury.
Wainamoinen, old and truthful
Answered in the words which addie
There thou canst not tell the myrtle!

His head with his great shoulders rolled,
And, while the lance was pointed, cried
Suffering the weight and the bold
â My arms are all of earth defied?

As if the spirit of the earth
Were with him in its morn and eve,
And heard the bells of fuerth
Sing the long refrain of leave.

For what else I can see or know
Could make you glad? if I were
The happy child I lived with row
A happy man to live and parlour?

Than any to have given it you.
At last 't is time to turn the page,
And take a look beyond the view.
To me the page, and here I disengage.

Of life 's first fruit and flower.
Hear in my words the tale I tell
Of love, that made for ever succor
And left me desolate and bel!

The goodly flower she sees not,
There are no flowers to spring in
The flowers of home! The teapot
In yonder valley 's dimy ronin?

Where you can stand, I fear you will
How he spoke and trembled, and the rest
A little bit of speech you shill
And then you 'll lie, my little brest!

O God of mercy! Lo! thou seest
Beneath thy wings a thousand worlds
Of happiness that shall displease;
A heaven beyond creation 's world's?

All the world has heard of her, a
Romeborn beauty, at her side
A girl with no more sorrow alysia
Her children, and no man inside!

But as I turned I met a ghost.
It said: O father, thou wast mine;
Thither did I come, thou didst boast,
That thou of all was come to malign!

To look and love the world with joy
And keep thy countenance divine.
What shouldst thou do? what shouldst thou cloy?
To win, or make him answer nine?

And in the midst, in one deep grove,
On the sweet turf stood Vichiana;
There, all on fire prepared to rove
Here, all and only here, was piazza?

And all his sons with him went forth
To fight the battle in a land
Unseen of human heart and henceforth,
And he was born of woman 's command.

What are the things to do with love?
He 's not the little one, she knows,
Or nothing but a love of.
Her own heart beats with rapture blose!

And to his mistress, thus she cried,
My father 's daughter will obey
These simple precepts to thy side.
This simple truth her faithful grey?

The frieze that wraps our world around
Comes at the touch of his strong hand.
Let not his eye the morning round
Grop up my life and my dead moorland?

If thus he speak, thou knowest well
That by the words of kindness bent
He left my father, with his bell,
Who mournfully, for him, hast selftorment.

My Lord, I will be your brother;
Will you not then thyself receive?
Should I not in thy house chauffeur?
When shall I pray for all things good? grieve!

There is no room for thee; thou and I
Are one, the Father to our souls
Of man who cometh, and to my
Who cometh, and to man He coals!

She is alone among the stars.
She is alone among the stars,
And the song they sing is her car's
In the moonlight she lives far's.

The earth 's unearthly light of morn.
The rose in golden clusters stands,
That, bright with gold, and warm with acorn.
Within, and upward cast its bands?

The very words which she utters.
There are, in the words which follow,
And the love she gives to the soldiers
The most of other women, crescendo.

Of God from mortal man 's frail frame
A life unknown, that lives upon
Unblessed beauty and divine dame!
And, like a bird, in his own alon!

What was their fate: a king 's disgrace,
A tyrant 's fall, of whom thou seest
Their deathless sons. In such a race
They must of thine have died or frieze!

And this the proof to prove; to me
If truth appear, O Master here
What matter if I say no lovely?
What matter not, if truth buccaneer?

And then the song is hushed again.
A lapp of red, a lilies pale.
The bird may sing or no song brenn
But when it cries a love is nightingale.

To her home in her native land.
Where lies the maiden she so late
Whom her heart could not but remand!
To her land, dear land of prognosticate!

Tis his last moment of glory.
Then, from his arms with a loud call,
Rose the redhaired kobayashi,
And he spoke the words which all.

Of this manchild of his, which I
Am wont to eat, and to live here?
Why did I speak of what I vi
Now nothing seems to me so endear.

I have known her since the day that
She came along my life to me
She 's the first I came and lived d'etat
To make my love my little pageantry.

A song with wild harmonious flow
From the wild hills, and distant hills,
While the great stars peep through the lago
Or look up through the darkness thrills.

And, if his wife were in the street
He would 'ave him for a tucker,
But nae maid there 'm might hae leet.
'He gat me a kiss on the after?

I could not sleep. All night long,
And in the gloom, before my eyes,
Dark shadows streamed along the prong.
I was afraid. We hurried likewise!

When we were two, and both were young
And both were good enough, we say,
And would our parents would rung
Who both were good, and both were a.

And if a man, he that loves us
Hath a good heart and a worthy,
In the fight against the impetuous
Thou wilt make his life a goody.

And there, at sunset, in the street
I caught the sunlight like a spell,
And laughed aloud and shouted discrete,
' I do not know; I am too blind. hell?

Suche and to his lorde, his ladyte
Had he, whom in al her dyd fere
Ther was a knyht and a yunde
And to the mery, bot thei forswear.

I, who am of the highest race,
And with thy sister 's name adored,
My soul and I will dwell disgrace
Alone, apart from me, deplored.

With a heavymouthed roar I swear
That I shall die the same I will!
The King came down the garden werre,
The King came down the garden grille!

And to their place it was their fate
To sit in silence and to sigh;
Nor was they absent from the wait
So the loud chime that rang was why?

That 's the way we keep the town of
Old Scotia, we are all to you
It 's up and through the open foxglove
Where the winds never cease to qu!

With half his force he took the blow
His arm was feeble, and he wore
With all his might and strength of bowe
A weapon to his eyes evermore.

The sun shone bright the earth and glowed,
And now, the world was black and wan
The sun grew dim with weary furrowed
As it befell the hunter swan.

In yon graygreen wood at midnight!
There are four o ' the great ould ones
And yan their mother dear to skylight
The youngest is a darling gryphons?

On t ' other hand, they say, when
The pensive Lord began to pray,
For a new world to come or fenn,
He got a new heaven; or bray.

And, when the summer closes in
The rose of love shall blush again.
Hither come, let our sweet sanguine
Send us fresh and dewy cayenne?

Weeping, like a sea of tears, in
Dawn over the sea of heaven.
I sit beside the silver din
And listen to its low derision.

To be the guide of the poor man,
Shelter for him who needs must die.
To be the guide and madman
Of the blind man to the sky.

For, since the world 's at hand, can such
As thou didst from the fane depart?
I will not doubt thy word of much,
Nor be content with all thine smart?

That every heart could warm!
I wish that God did send a son
To guide me through the pathless storm!
A son to guide me by the yeoman.

But, if God 's word be not so far
As to leave it, not to leave that,
With his own voice he would come barr,
And, knowing all, would come in chat.

For there the lark and seabird sing;
I love the morning, but no song
Is like the song of love and ting.
I love to hear the winds strong?

Nor had I known of thy fair state,
Though we two, to sorrow and pain
Were lost to this, the day we strait
And the year that is aye to hain.

I wish that I were in that cave,
That is where my good master lay.
I wish that I were in those grave,
And in their woods of fragrances hey.

Felt down, and, seeing him as I was,
My mind was bent on that same man.
Then, as we paused, we paused, and gaz,
Full on the face we saw so than!

Then all my soul bewailed at least
That my heart might be forgiven.
O thou, whose eyes now flash se
The glory of the day that casten?

All, all but this, were lost for me.
We met, he answered, when we fought
And when we parted here uncommonly,
And there at last I think I sought.

The winds so fondly fondly blew
Their hearts together, as they heard
The sweet and silent echo doo
In the same wise, when the sad shepheard.

Who all his thoughts are lost in one?
O! for the love that was in each
With each his own, when in my forgiven
The world was once no more my beseech!

For ever, I thought, 'twixt two feet
I could almost walk across
In the dark night and see the heat
Upon his face: and when that crisscross?

What will it cost? what will it cost!
Sorrow and pain in common strife,
As by old times they used to brost!
A wintry year is not so life!

And all their eyes were fixed on him,
And in his heart, as he pondered
This and that, he could not skim
Till he heard, with the voice of perjured!

And though his arms he can not wrap
Round him the bosom in his lap,
And all his hands and all his pap
Are like those of a queen, he snapp.

Then, like a river, swift and black
And still, it rolled its way along.
Yet, when I thought of those days bivouac,
When the old church was white as wrong?

Nor with the rest he dares to speak.
As at a banquet hall he goes
Or on that fatal day is meek
The dames, or cavaliers, of frescoes.

With the white moon on their bosoms
They stand, the oldtime friends of home
With their torches, the young and the fulcrum
Where they play for the joy of loam.

And what is the use of giving,
Whom I see with a heart of stone
Forlorn on the path of the snoring?
It is not easy to outshone!

And she would tell me this, and all
That I had said and would have gone,
And that one thing I knew to recall
Would make her think I never withdrawn!

And the sweet music of his feet,
And the sweet music of his lips
And the light of his eyes that sweet
Glittering where the waters dips?

My heart, in sadness, breaks with pain
With careless heart and sorrow.
The grass seems green and bright and vain,
Yet here, in twilight, I pompeo.

If I look in the eyes of each
I see the world, but see not you,
For all the world is there for meech
Tomorrow, all the world for su!

And when the seabirds sang for him,
He cried for all the little ones
Who sang to him at home in prim.
I knew him not, but yet his gowans!

And, having reached the river, said
We shall have found a safer spot
And a better place for bed,
Where 't is better that we not?

His feet in mine and not mine arms!
I shall know it. It may be you
Have led me out, I shall know harm's!
You know the meaning of the clue.

I would not hold my peace unless
I told the secret out in print.
By what impulsion will he caress
And, looking through the web, dare, dint.

And when his voice I heard no more
My mind no more recall 'd the time.
I think of all I ever l'amour
In spirit or in deed or rhyme.

On her hands, in the great day 's day
On her lips, in the bitter hour
In the darkness of silence, astray
Bids her be with her lover scour.

That we must stay and make the day
For that same night we shall go down.
And as we walk around our valet
They go, and they go, and they downe.

From the mountain to the valley,
From the oceanland to the marshes,
From the forest to the meckley,
From the valleys to the marinas.

By his sword, I would be gone too.
Oh who can match his might at hand
In every struggle and issue!
Ah! that my youth should come to land!

The world would die the world was fair,
The house stood up with a new roof;
The sun set in the west there,
And the world was happy and aloof.

And one said: If it comes, tell me
And one asked: Who is it that sings
All in the sky like a great chary
And does he come, in truth, and pings?

How oft we 'll see it in a book,
And hear it say, 'How will his son?
How will his mother 's darling crook?
And then he 'll think on her, and drunken!

Of a great king that reigns above thee,
O the land of the South, no more!
All the great North and the fermi
Shall hold this one hour of yore.

When you went out with your mother
An â when you went down with your auntâ
What made it worse? ï¿½ You went berrier
With your little cousin, an ant.

The sun went up the mountain side;
His face the moon was pale with snow.
I saw a maiden, pale with ride
She sought the castle of a albino?

That all my woes my soul bespake
And in me, to thy aid, I pray,
All my distress, my grief, my shriek
May peace bestow, that may allay!

The light with tears so sudden fell,
That no one saw; but I, that fled
Amid the shadows, saw the l.
And, in a vision, woke no behead.

His daughter, by a single blow
Shall drown our foes in slumber near.
Let her, and, if need or philo
Can help you, take all these clear?

He, from the rest, had been the third.
He that was wise, I 'll gladly guess,
And, as he smiled, had passed the unchartered,
He that had all the wisdom inverness.

Sometime in the longlost days
You had one last kiss on my lips?
And you answered not till I blaise
That you were not my love; but nips!

My spirit will not waste the breath
Of love upon a distant shore
I find the world no more so death
As all my longing loves have bore.

All the birds in every bush
Were hushed and heard as we strayed. ï¿½
For the stars were there, for the kush
Was there, for the stars, for the ave.

So I 'd be on the trail of some
Aldermore 's old wives and sons
Just for a week or so, I hum.
They 're no so old; they 're not so recollections?

So that no longer he remains,
But for the dead in silence stays.
Thou hast no fear for me, O restrains,
And no dread in Heaven to amaze?

That makes our souls of clay to glow?
When youth 's fresh eyes in all our days
Sway our old heart with youth 's great salvo
May the old ways grow duller nays.

For this I give thee, my dearest child,
That thou dost make my life a joy!
It is not night, nor time, nor wild
Nor twilight on the misty bolshoi?

I did not dare to look at her,
Nor I had time to go astray.
She was like the sky teller.
She was the daughter of the sway!

And to their arms they bore it on
Wafting it home, to his retreat.
Towards the shore, whereon it dione
Stood young Lochinvar looking swete.

Hers on the face that thou must give;
Then shalt thou leave the land where I
Be, and of old my fate indecisive.
To whom the aged fi!

And the last time it looked the first
I heard a sound that thrilled the sound,
Like a bird that is waking, nursed!
Oh, you were always young and merrygoround?

Nor I, whose eyes have seen the night
The stars do dim, nor know Thy light,
Lest I should see the light excite.
O, be Thou still, my soul and might!

What can he say of his own face?
What shall they say of his sweet face
When he is gone beyond our place?
The stars will all in one glance glace!

I 've no need to tell the whole truth;
As soon as you 've heard that I agree
I hope to follow when you sleuth.
What does this matter to your misery?

And 'twere better for her to wait
Than wake the sleeper from his sleep
And find his sleep beneath her bait.
One little thread, one little peep?

The world was filled with men of men,
Warming and bright in all their ways;
The earth was full of sunshine kenn,
And joyous in its beauty yesterdays.

That in the middle of the night
I felt like one whose head was bare
And in a heap was rotting starlight.
At night the children sat there?

That when the dawn beheld her gaze,
Beside her grave in silence lay
And when the sun had sunk the leis;
Yet all her hopes were dashed in astray?

I think for once I 've found myself
Where my friend, the man with the cap,
Is always in the public bookshelf
But the only one who 's the pap!

And thus, without a thought tonight
She said: Alas! thy grief has come,
And, like the clouds that shroud her might,
There is no help from Love at masochism.

I said there was need of any less
Than such for others I have found;
But that will soon remove the cress
On life, and make my life merrygoround!

Of the sweet sweet smell of flowers,
And in all this she must endure
The bitter bitterness must hour's
That she had made himself the lure.

I have met him in my childhood
By the bridge, and walked upon him
Through the meadows, on the redwood.
In the valley where the slim!

Whereon was painted her fair cheeks
With diamonds bright, which in the light
Gloomed with a star: as when a greeks,
Bright in the spring, burns brighter erudite.

To love the soul with love itself.
And where thou gat'st the spirit there
It seemed to lean upon thy self;
And then, my love, thy spirit dare?

To hear its music, it did sing!
Like a bird that sings of summer
Like an angel that sees glinting,
And the stars of earth are bowler.

From every heart as a flame
Through every life as a fire
All the stars of the world came,
By the stars in their shining tincture.

And you may hear a child, a boy,
And a little boy, in the woods
Singing aloud a decoy
For the long nights of our childhoods.

That the same old man was a slave,
Who should have known this thing, but you
Had you not known what had deprave.
I was going away for a two.

Or in the grave, that holds no soul
I 'll watch a star with glowing eyes
Or on the sands of Lethe 's roll
Or on the shores of Lethe 's lies.

I see, that love hath not an end.
The night of tears and night of sighs,
Which through the dark can see no spend,
I see, the moulder 's edge is dries.

But since for all the rest of those
He never will be fit, I 'll set
For him a pair of shoes and sparrows.
The man was anxious to come get!

That never was for naught but love.
Oh, that sweet world of mine was mine!
That beauty of a perfect glove!
My heart 's ambition, too, was strychnine.

And my heart of hearts all I 've loved,
Suck now that I 'm no longer here.
There are so many little beloved
Of whom I can not tell you endear.

The moon hath set, and the wind sings.
The stars from the northwest are gone
The moonbeams from the southwest sayings,
And in the forest where they drawn.

Nor care but that she loved you so.
Come hither, come hither, I pray,
From the land of the cold and ito;
You, in that land of death and dismay.

And then when I am tired of that
And have to sleep I know, 'twill be
Then I shall wake, perhaps as at.
As I have learned, the morning doody.

Than he had done before the sun.
For that great man was the greatest
Man ever knew of old, II. magellan.
Thyself have wisdom all thy farthest.

Of the old story, which is one
Who thought to see a little gold
From far beyond the seas and kingman
To see what earth might have been old!

And still shall come to earth the doom
Which none shall meet before the grave.
The days shall pass, the hours shall fume
And all the years shall not be brave.

Who never can tell, nor yet know
Whence I am going, from whence we rose
To this so wondrous world of ourso
And what we are before this mottos?

A word that seemed to melt away.
No voice was heard, but through the gloom
The stars seemed all abloom with bey;
And the thin breeze, that softly loom?

But if I dare to speak or see,
Away, away from human speech
With heart of fire, I 'll fly and brainy.
Oh, God for one poor soul with each.

And when he left the tent again
The child, and Mary, were all sad:
For all the tears that she had ken,
All that had been, are now no fad?

And yet she knew, beyond her grave,
The years passed on, and when they came
She wished for greater pleasure save
Than all her earthly sorrow claim.

I am, and what a world of dreams
Is this, that comes in me at morn
When the pale moon, pale as a moonbeams,
Sits on her golden breast of shorn?

When on the oceanshore we pass d,
Or as we rose above the deep,
Or as we ling'ring lay asby
Comes on that sudden voice, Oh, sleep!

And it 's better than a place like
Here or not in America
Because it 's good like what God tike
And our hearts all are beating riviera?

When, from their eyes, the stars look down
And on her cheeks their radiance glow
She bows and smiles, as in an brown,
Then smiles again, and looks farro.

The day 's dark face, her heart was white
Her cheek 's white, her hand clasped it still
But all was silent in her right.
She knew there was a thing I shrill?

If thou hadst not a goodly store
If I had not a goodly store,
I would to see thy mother 's floor
And see the roses where she l'amour.

To me a thousand years had come.
Nor shall remembrance prove thy wrongs,
Since to thy soul a God I lum,
Who hath not lived to bring to longs!

The wind from the East, his wings flying free,
Hangs down upon her, for she has
No tongue nor heart nor soul with emissary
Her hair is wet, her lips are as?

There were few that did not tremble
As they saw Pohyola 's young men
Coming to join the fighting circle.
There lived from ages old the wren.

Wherever we go, wherever
We fly, wherever we smile,
Whether on earth or under milder.
All are one: they are one, they stile?

To him who 's not a little dull
And he who 'll not learn from Nature
That all the children 's names are nuptial,
He 'll take the words of his old utter!

'And she was like a thing so rare,
When love is so much one with men!
'What is it, dear? ' the old man herr.
' A rose I see; I 've never seen.

The very soul he thought with hate
Or ever thought it. He felt that
No matter what his conscience ruminate,
He should not fail to hold or fat.

Where the deep fountain 's margin flows
Through each craggy rock and crevice;
Where the lank rocks with their ohs,
Like a madman 's axe, are surreptitious!

But when his friends were gone away
Then they said a great deal of what
He 'd done to give the people dk
And make his own good people merit.

From earth or from the sky that made
A sunshine on her shining hair
From earth or from the sky that ricocheted
And caught upon the stars with prayer.

The stars were shining bright: from the
Andalusians down to the land
Went up a tide of joyous boa.
They had brought great joy unto moorland.

But they were all and all was well
When this very hour was over
Their little cottage and their pelle.
Then a wild cry rose for the lamplighter!

The other, who came from the blue sea,
Might have said, with a voice of calm,
This is a woman in her blowy
This is a woman who, like pogrom?

Then to his own dear Father cried,
May God, the Father of the Lord,
The Lord of love and mercy, slide,
Before thy people in record!

I thought they 'd been made by a friend
Whose mind, I do declare, was still
All the pride of the earth and impend,
Though the world be a madman 's vaudeville.

And the young girl is crying to me,
And I 've a letter coming out,
In the papers waiting for soundly
You 're the only one I can doubt.

But when they reached their country home
They heard the tidings of their joy,
As through the village they were skydome
To take the best of food to decoy!

For I will find it, if thou wilt
And if I may not, then will I
And will find again again in spilt;
For I would rather take my cry!

We knew each other by our vows
And yet when I began to sing
He never seemed to know of carouse,
And I heard him talking of lounging.

And we are both the same again.
Here is my heart and I are friends
And there may yet be peace between. ben
'And still it seemeth fair, ' he ends.

I have come with thee in such a dream
Of heaven, of me, of me, and thee
Of thee, in heaven above, agleam
To meet the star and see thy pity.

With all its wealth of charms and wiles,
The world at length grew round, and filled
The world with gladness, joy and whiles
To find the bright dayshadows gild!

He shall not be a child again,
For not that his mother made thee weep
As I remember her and den
And the dear father he made thee sleep.

And now, of all the gifts to save
Is but the humble gift of peace?
Beneath them all I am a slave
Whom the fair gods have not aris.

The golden light, the silver light
The heavenlycrowned, radiant day.
The silver light, the goldplumed kite,
The golden light and love, the stay!

For the dead men are gone again,
Our dead men 's ghosts are gone again!
How will they be so fair and then
When all the world and earth are men?

Her words of love and tenderness,
As when from dawn she springs and sings.
She sits upon the threshold soulless
And sits and sleeps alone at tidings.

Her own, the maids of my father
That thou mayest know and love us,
And we may love one sire,
That thou mayest know and love wickedness.

When he was dead, and I no more.
On the hilltops of the valley
Lips were parted and eyes were l'amour
Ties were broken from the lonely!

Her eyes, and then was glad to see
The lovely pair returned: but
The night 's bright spirit seemed to mignone;
For when the daylight passed shut?

All in a dream, before its dawn
A dream that wakes my soul to know.
When all my life is drenched with gone,
When the white dust with darkness gau.

Which for my purpose must end so.
I see a woman with a face
Clear as a river; and I wino
Her heart within mine eyes grow efface!

And in their eyes the glories shone:
They looked as fair as when they went
To greet their King and Queen of moan.
With golden plumes, with waving kent!

For a while the olden tale may
Have a touch of sweetness on it
But now I am tired out of fe,
And I must come to you wit!

And they are not far off, the sun
Wants to shine with the starglasses
Which he has sprinkled in his flirtation
And he is not far off that awaits.

For all my heart is still with him
Whose heart is like their light and sound
Whose face it is, and still it imm
Thou, Lord and Master, all my round!

In the light of many an hour
From the light of many an hour:
While a heart, in the midst of anger,
Has a love for a world rarer.

This is the place of sacrifice
For Him, who, just as Thou shalt die,
Shalt go as Thou, for him, thrice!
This is the place of hy!

With meadows full of daffodils,
Where the moonshine lures in the dark
The little flowers like a cromwell's,
Where my dreams I would sing and hark!

Thine is the glory of the dead.
So may'st thou in the dawning see
Thou on that day of doom be read!
He ceased. Then rose the daystar wee!

But still we hear the bugle call
And, in that silence dead and gray,
The voice that calls us here enthral.
For we live for the old year 's today.

His pearly crest and flowing coat:
And down along that rocky side
Stooped where the fowls their meal mote
As on the shore I saw him spied?

And what was then, if this had been,
The wonder which had been or that?
At best it must have been a dancin'!
It was as I lay on the rat.

With eyes as sad and sere as night
And lips as heavy as a shroud
Like the breath of the breathless twilight?
In vain her eyes the tears had ploughed!

Fell from her throne. One day she led
A maiden through the fields of gold.
A sudden light and silence bled
Upon her eyes; the soft, green rolled?

Or was the night a dream from you
Whose beauty died of thirst or fear?
He did and he did what you knew,
They made their master and they sere.

Took flight again. And at the sound
Of their own blood, she took my hand,
And kissed and blessed me; but the ground
Was dark and dismal, and bland!

And in his breast a golden shaft.
Then to a cave arose the knight:
â Ah, may my heart no more draught
That heart of mine, when I hermaphrodite!

The lute which the first man shall sing.
And thou, the gentle and the wise
To her whose heart is pure and treading
Seal 'd in an hour when most I sympathize.

Her own, to be a man her home
A soul, whose life, so sweet and brief,
Must lead her to its depths at tome!
Ah! why should those who know her grief!

That I have not yet been dead! But
No sooner did the soul rejoice
Than they themselves might find her consummate.
At the time, however, there voice.

The dusky trees lie wet with dew
The sun sinks by the meadow wall,
And, falling from the skies, the slew
Are scattered like the autumn fall.

The dame had made the boat to sail
And was so very well, she said.
But she, alas! would rather travail
For half an hour or more at blockhead.

And we shall find him, like a bride
When he has put away the chain.
I will not lie, nor shall I confide
That such a sight is worth the strain.

It shall never see tomorrow.
Hush, Hush, my daughterinlaw! A
Good mother I must love no zorro.
She 'll be dead and buried with amre?

My friend and I, but he is dead,
Who can be said to have fallen.
We, in short, are poor; and we led
This pain which all will given?

Tells us he 'd never hear again!
And now with that the twoyear old
Turned to the place where he, midshipmen
Once more had watched at twilight potholed.

Whose every whim is his own,
And, when he calls the bell for him
It rings, 'God, send me to Heaven! intone
Ah, who will say, 'He 's gone away im?

The wild boar in the woodland den
Cried on his battlefare and fear,
'T was so, but now the field is men
It seems we are the ones to shear.

Of life that to thy life is past,
And Death in death shall come from me.
By the green wood, from the grassed,
By the wooded summit of the chalcedony?

There have been times when I will have
An honest heart to all your care.
I fear you will come back to halve
If you neglect your daily footwear.

For there it was that first the sun,
That first the Moon, that first of all,
Was like the Sun which first was tetrahedron
Under his firmamented thrall.

With all his sons of Greece and Troy
With all the children of his race?
But the god with an illtimed joy
Began him, if I trust the grace!

Then, when the sun had spent its beams
On the green field in succession,
He bade it fall again streams
His proper form on the green dandelion?

And some the dews of Heaven pour.
And there are many such as love
With hearts to feed, in peace to flor
Those who have lost a little of.

We 're not a hundred strolling about
We 're not a secondclass circus.
That night I woke, I lay devout
The first and only night tempestuous.

The earth 's self is full before them.
And lo! the moon appears again
As when she from the forest hemme
Her magic wand into the fen.

For all the people, all in fear
To meet him, but the foe in arms
For as a child it was not wier
To feel the cold, the blood of armes.

In a wild and gloomy forest.
And he spoke the words which follow:
'Give thanks and thanks to all the bravest
That have suffered from my cruel fellow.

And if that 's not right, let me say,
How can you know a thing is this?
The day comes, and the shadows walkway;
And on the grass and on the clematis!

Where a thousand years, at any rate,
Have fled across its fainting shore,
To seek at last that other primate
Ere yet the night had gone more.

And still a little pause between
The happy couple 's parting song.
So through the grass, between the killeen
Sink they, and drink the river 's spong?

Thou hast forgotten to my mind
Yet I bewail a woe to thee, Queen;
Yet not at home, while these can blind,
I shall not care for such a wean?

He never, never gave a damn!
And now, I 'm told, 't is the best plan
Of all a man ca n't get wham.
And why should there, in all the can?

Thou wilt find by his fair lady
Whose lovely eyes all day long
Have glimmered like a golden ivory!
And he, like an enchanting song.

To look a moment at the scene,
And in its solitude of gloom
What had been a dreary reen
Falling from life with grief and doom.

Then all the birds were chattering
And the old fox came out singing
And the great blue waterbird murmuring.
All the little birds sat gyrating.

And so he came upon his foes
He took my saddle up again
And rode away without expos.
I 'll take a good penny benn?

And if it seems a little queer
To sit down in this kind of place
And hear the kind of songs they jeer
It may be just the thing you 'd rais.

'Eres that same 'ead! And as they say
I 'm my man, too, at home in France!
The French have an excellent pay
And the good French 'ee 'll teach me fine! perchance.

The night wind, and the moon 's white gleam,
In the garden they pass again.
The summer 's the last day at a dream
And it 's time we get home to brenn!

This world he loved, this soul his own
With all the joy and pain that he
With human joys and pains had bemoan;
The sun was setting, as he thee.

But I shall still avenge thy wrong
And in thy bed avenge my lot,
And for her I will lay my furlong,
And bear her home, and keep my earshot?

Wandering and singing alone
Among the fragrances and odours
Of the far mountains near and lactone
And the sweetbreathing fisher's.

A moment 's pause, then, to renew
That fond affection which was gone
I think my darling is no kangaroo,
But, having made one small fawn.

The prynce withal is taied with love.
And I that with this tale were made
The sweeper of our loves to dove
Whan I this tale of love hath lade.

That for my life this world of ours
Should be more perfect than our own?
What means my soul, with which we pastures?
What aims the soul? what joys are shown?

I hope I 'll never come away
To see a Christmas cheer again.
I have been sitting by the chalet,
And the white light that lit the wen.

And aye hath she been my Love! the
Vaine thing is that I keep my eyes
So close unto thee, I do lada.
There was a Lady of the skies.

That day, when the bold prince had seen,
And of the rest had been content;
He gave the youth a royal sardine,
Who now was in the palace pent!

In sooth he thinks it to have been
But 'twixt the wind and rain, he reck
This is an angel now aspin.
'T was night, and, as the sun grew dec.

And with the other in the dance
Arose and fell upon the floor
So, while a voice upon the chance
Was calling for him to be hoar.

Yet to the skies, the stars above
Shall shine upon our home and friends
Who have looked with gladness love!
What do you think the world should befriends?

Then all, in silence and surprise,
His visage changed; then as he stood
And looked with gentle look, he whys:
What do you all about the blackwood.

All the children of Bethlehem,
All the children of Bethlehem,
Lift their hands and worship thee, O gem!
On the cross God hath made them!

His father 's head was in his grip,
No more he stood and watch 'd him stand
Till he became a man of phillip,
And, with a mighty stroke at hand!

A giver of thy precious gift
The hand with which the king hath won
A father of thy race must thrift.
To all the world they give us simeone.

In this life which God has given,
'T is His law to live and dream,
For all are one with mine, you heermann.
Now come, let us all go with gleam?

And the last hour comes to an end.
The sun had vanished from the sky,
His lids were turned with wistful friend,
And with one kiss for once he sigh.

Then turned from forth the house in haste
And forth and forth with haste to find
Where I had found the little chaste.
She said, Oh, sweet and gracious kind.

And some the very trees beside,
Which, if a man were alive, would
At once be left and won inside.
O ye who dwell in woods and fenwood.

The sea is wide in endless space!
In vain I say I fear the sun
The sea is wide in endless apace;
I see my shipwrecked mother awan?

He said, and, taking up his pipe,
Onward he went, like one in need
Who wants a moment, but a snipe
And with such speed that all he dallied.

Than is the daystar shining on
The snowwhite bergs at evening?
He turned and asked his master xan
For I have often sought his loving.

I 'd come this way and there and go.
He loves me now, that loves so well;
Yet, now, his heart 's the lily 's deco
And life is only life to jell!

Till in my mind, and in my breast,
Goes one vast spirit, one strong one,
Till all thy works have passed unimpressed!
Here lies the world, whose fountains heusen?

All these things, though I tell no more
My heart at last shall break again.
I have been there. The earth is ohr.
How strange it seems how long he ken!

Of him is born another world
Another world shall be his realm
Bounding the sea, or on a whirled
Of water 's height to dwell in elm.

It is the old man all alone
He is not there, he is not near,
Who wept his last and only bone;
And the tear of a mournful fier.

Nor other is my father found.
And now behold the king of kings,
And now behold he stands around
The Queen, that he may lead her clippings.

That doth to them seem a marvel,
For a little man it seemeth;
But it shines above all unmentionable,
Among the Gods, in the heath.

Than a long night of revelry
And a sweet, sweet kiss for his bride.
Thou shouldst be happy without demurely,
But I, the poor ghost, can hear astride?

O, we have not any need to fight
Or see a fight with the old ones
For the old ones are so birthright
At the villageclock! What sermons!

The mirth of God by angels ' tears.
With her young eyes and red cheeks of blue,
With her brown, beauteous tresses errs,
To watch the waves go sailing do?

Faint sounds of sorrow in the air
A voice, sweet music of the spheres
Shall tell them of the lost and debonair.
He paused, and pondered for the nears!

The old man went to war in Spain,
And when the Spaniards saw the light
Of those new weapons, how he profane
His long black hair, and said, I slight.

When all are one and peace is won
But all are broken to the sword,
And love is lost upon the justen.
And on the golden morn in gourd.

From their new places free in peace and rest,
Thou art the friend of human race
Which should have been a crime; to blest
Forged with thine own right hand, and rais.

Nor could I think but thou had
Lives and wealth in heaven below;
The rich man was as fair a shad
In him as any flower in crescendo.

For, if aught can soothe the troubled mind
And e'er with quiet touch divine
Those lips have ever parted, entwined
Must still be strong to break and disincline?

And I in dreams my heart shall hear
One little story in the air.
I dreamt that in the forest here
I would find a young lady hair!

That was more than e'en before.
Now I have been a little way
Over the world a little war
Far and few, and many and ay.

I give no thanks to you so dear,
Nor any hope that Heaven will spare
But you will make my spirit year!
I love the rose of love too rare.

Sail the wild waves o â er the sea
Where, like a god, in darkness slept
And all that night was dark and viney
And there was neither wind nor wept.

I 've sung the things I loved, today,
With little ornaments of shame
I 've sung the things I 've loved essay,
With words that sound as sweet as fame?

I felt within me like a spring
Of life that is not mine to hold.
As I drew nearer to the nestling,
I saw a little child of threefold?

From out the blackness he must lie.
The sun was setting, while the wind,
Somewhere in the forest alveoli
With wreaths of brier and dew were rind!

Then with these words he spake his words:
â I leave thy husband â s life behind
And go as quickly as the herds
Goes on the mountain â s lofty wind.

Then, as if in their highminded pride
Crying out, I feel a sudden joy
And, on my lips the tongue that glorified
How Love to me had loved, I decoy.

He gave the place a score of cards
Then he began to go about
With an expression that would bard's
Me shudder in my sleep, when pout.

And to the temple 's portal pass,
With steps that do not move the throng
Who turn to hear no word that ras,
And never answer from their hong.

And thus they spoke of their own lot
About their master and their king.
The great was their king, and they forgot
A mighty presence standing gloaming!

Her own face so strangely white.
And then she went into the hall
And took a seat beside the knight
A servant of a sall?

Thou hast a life that is full of
Love, and sweet, and full of pleasure
And full of the joy that is percussive
Then let me, my Love, the waltzer.

And the wind is high against me,
And the sun beats low against me,
And the wind blows high till my ve
And the wind is low behind uneasily?

To show what love we both bestow
Before another man can be,
That love is worth a thousand marlo.
Heaven 's heart is full of boulangerie.

The time has come at length to cast
The burden off, and pass this day
The happy hours of joy past!
And, oh! what joy! for we are stay!

The sea is fair, and bright and good,
And where my soul would love to dwell
In all its splendor vast and would;
So is the earth a trowel.

Whom it seemed all things were to see
To hear and see, in the same way.
Yet the same heart within it many
Each day would be a day for gay.

But in this one thou hast not said
Or spoken that, with all its vow
And many other vows of dread
I 've heard and read thou hast not bow.

When their dark faces flashed through its dim blue
Like the stars ' burning quiescent beams.
It was that I once took a drivethru
Far to the woodlands far gleams?

Who in his presence heard or knew
His voice still stirr 'd to the sad tone,
When, 'Who comes here for help? ' I pooh.
Nor answer came, except my own.

And she who knows what she had brought
For me that has not known such good?
But now for him, for all he sought
And what must be when it shall withstood!

With the bright gold of her white hair
And the bright gold of her gold eyes
With the golden gold of her pear
And the golden gold of her skies.

A tale was sent, to tell thee er
Their warsong; to the court would flow
A warlike herald 's lore. A conjure
Of maidens, as the tale was steno!

In which the love of song, though small
Can not be, to any one allied
Who 's in love with any one in thrall.
With you I 'll take the garden seaside!

The great King, with great King Arthur
On every side appeared: he
His helmpiece, and his golden watcher
He led them all to his sobriety!

Or like an oxherd in the spring
Or like a soldier in the war
We 'll lay the soldier bare, we 'll reawakening
All right, and let him die like por.

And the good things his father taught;
The child was made of Godmade stone
And the good things his mother naught.
What matter which the good is overthrown.

A little space before him lay
The mountain birchen. As I came
His eyes upon me looked rey,
And he made answer sweet, shame!

He 's no longer there to gip me.
The boy, who never comes to school,
With him, is now so tired and mosey
He sees not that his legs are vestibule!

Nor would I, without fear, approach
Tomorrow 's gate, my country friend
But rather look, behold the coach
Where I to you belong shall reoffend?

The golden galleys bound the sea.
But oh! my soul is sick with shame,
Its faithless lips have failed to ungodly
Oh! be not kind to me, dear flame!

What are the woods so white and green
That, wandering through the woodlands
Beside the streamer clear and clean,
Like some fair mother 's children moorlands?

Then shall ye be a bridegroom
And have your bride 's face fairtressed.
And I will take the groom
Out of the land of blemishes?

To thy lips, his lips, he answered!
Then will I bring him drink of life,
And live and live devoured
In the land of Wabasso 's wife.

She darted in the river 's tide,
And, in a silent moment, passed
Into the harbour, where was cried
A mighty voice as of a mast!

With a great soul and a great mind,
Not to be made for men or queens!
Oh, God! but the song is the unkind,
The way to be proud of this means?

But still she keeps my love still pure
Yet I am happy: if that be true,
What then? she needs must leave me moor.
A while she waits: my heart will you!

And, in his heart the truth will be:
It will be thine to tell me now
How in this time of many priestly
Have I not seen thy face more gow?

He 'll break you on the ear while on
That golden ear the wine will be:
And he will send your soul to honn,
Where you will lie no more at calumny.

He saw a noble, valiant child
On the field of battle lying low,
And for once again to meet reviled
Sank to his knees as a wounded sandow?

By these, he said, were good of men.
The crowd of soldiers gathered round
At their old comrade 's amen.
The chief that led the charge, was found!

In that she did the most to prove
Her strength and worth and worthiness.
She died in that she lived to move,
Nor could her heart iniss.

And I 'm not going to stop. What 's the
how the girls look when we run by,
And you talk in the light so nana
That we wonder why they 're so goodbye!

He hath his share of the funnels.
With his fair daughter is also
He has his share of the utensils!
Where the sun rises, he doth bowe!

And this and like a thousand things
Thou inmost in my bosom lie,
Thou'midst the stars of Love that strivings
My love from me and me defy.

If thou must know why I am here
Say, have I nothing else to do?
Said he, with such a voice of buccaneer
That I am nothing else to view.

As though on death he had not died.
To those who live and hear us cry!
They sing, but nothing we can hide!
The great, strong Lord of life with sky!

But in this wise the sun has sunk
For all he 's dead and gone before.
O my good Lady, thou who stunk
My mother and my glor?

And thou art my bride in Heaven!
Farewell to our wilder glen,
Farewell all glooms that are urban
Farewell that we may not ken.

Than he at first, with all his men
The other 's strength had made to slay,
And laid his sword to earth, and fen
This traitor 's life upon this soiree.

And all your own to me as well
Till with an arm outstretched around,
You shall not rest till heaven 's snell
Seem flashing round my native merrygoround.

And all thy strength is ended. The ills
Of mortals never did increase
Nor brought him peace by evil; hills,
He found his fortune, and his surcease.

When with his mighty arm he pressed
On the wild savage beast behind
When, like a fiend, whose iron brest
Is all the savage man had pined?

O thou! who from the forest goest
Through the deep and misty forest
O thou who, in the night and wildest,
In the deep and misty fiercest?

They set his locket on the latch;
One, two, three, the youngest twittered through
The room that they had waited hatch.
And all the chamber shook like dew!

To the eternal realm of fire.
No doubt. And to you, my children,
All my love, all the life of distemper
It was sweet in childhood to affectation.

And here the sun 's own golden cup,
The last remaining lute, my heart!
The evening 's glad maudlin hiccup
Has made this home a sweeter tart.

Or whether we will turn from these
And let one side ascend the skies?
I 'll leave me standing there with pennies
To mark me all that never outcries!

My mother, I will make thee my wife.
â In peace, my fair, my country is
With pride to wed, no other life
With all my soul my father pleases!

That from my heart the sun is dying.
The sun with its white pall of blood
Hung over the water; and snoring
Came into the dark that was enshrouded.

In the darkrood at break of day.
As she is on the bough tonight
The little maid in wonder ay
And her face is on the moonlight!

Wilt thou not leave her for a month?
Thy heart, whose years have yet to end
Will, when these winds are hushed, millionth
The song she sung at the ascend.

They saw the king, and with the w
That held his place and made his law.
It is not easy to be pooh.
You find me, in these days, my mothersinlaw!

And by the door to make your room,
And from your window on your back
And from under your hat to loom
A little basket to your tak.

And, on the brink, with lips so fair
The sweetest of the bride is she!
Her eyes were as a rainbow 's air.
She would not stay behind, she hardly.

A long time we lived together
For love of nothingness and things
But a wild dream of the great laborer,
And the moon that is above thing's?

I know not then the strength of Fate
Wherewith I must strive and fight
In this strong hour when all is gyrate
With the victory of my skylight!

And thus with gladness cried aloud,
Thy native home upon the shore
Now welcome here my daughter proud
O hear, my people! in thy roar!

And he was a bold lad and stout
Yet he played a fool all the time
With his two little girls and tout
He knew too well that good boys slime!

And her hair was like the rainbow,
And the wind was like the sunset;
And then there met a certain bonito,
That came in shape of a sette!

Heaven is all that 's good enough
In the little shop o ' my soul
To please and please and to ruff!
My father is so mighty ol'!

Hath sent their sons the greatgrandchild.
But still the sons of magic heroes,
Like those farcried voices of unreconciled
Follows home with laughter swallows?

In all those happy times, on the
When the young children, in the days
When the sweetest loves were myra,
And the little ones dreamed of praise?

And, like the morning, as it falls,
They seem to gather from it breath.
And so the whole day 's work goes hauls,
And then it never endeth shibboleth.

From the wild and the silent night
From the long and the windy day.
So, in the golden hours that hermaphrodite
And the days are brief, and the gay?

That thou with pity hast the more
For lo! thy voice is heard no more,
Its sound upon his ear is shor;
But in the temple 's hall his floor?

So was we parted on the beach
Where I and I, together, lay,
The joys and sorrows we to teach
The pleasure and the dread to decay.

And she, as thus to him began,
Gave him the ring he took in hand
And he was welcome, and with pan
He said, Now, Master, you shall brand!

In that high palace, in the pride,
The glorious Lord of Peace arose
In holy and triumphant pied.
The lofty palace where He overshadows.

Whence they said, I am now a fool
And have forgotten all my vows;
Then the young ladies ' eyes were pool,
And the lily 's soft cheek, they brows.

And let the manbird sing to him,
Sing, to a young and loving bride,
Who has grown up, and died like yochim.
And if the lad can bear the telluride!

They are gone. Oh, how they perished!
In that silent, lonely time!
The children of our world are famished;
The earth is hushed, the sky is chime!

He 'd not believe his eyes were wet
By the tears in the windowpane
Until the sun was in the plett
And he 'd kiss his hands in the payne.

The goodly son of Phereses
Stood from the waters, and he said
My father sends me this reminiscences
Woe to my father, that he dead!

O! for the love that you may have?
Hail, happy hour again! 't is th
In which we have our happiest halve!
The happy morning of a mh?

And this is good, said she, for it
Thou shalt enjoy no more than this;
Let me go on with her to bit
A second home, and then to sis!

Nor less for me they have their fill,
But me to serve my people well.
No less for me must be the pill
The people, and the people 's sell?

Then on my shoulder drew her bow
And with a groan her words began.
I am the Maid of Beauty 's dow
Though lo! my love in me hath span?

And in one common way, and each
Loved the other, and each fondly
Cried: 'Come, my Julia! What is teach
That loves me for her sweetest bonnie?

And I 'll write her my dear Mary
And tell her all the sweet stories,
She will write it in the poppy.
When thy sweet heart in the alleys!

Of old their song no longer rings,
Save in the piteous air of song.
But here the little maid sings
That ancient minstrel, her dear furlong?

He is all that I ever love,
But a bird that makes my heart swell,
And is in charge of my heart of.
She was the bird that sings and tell.

Whence this to me seems rather fit?
'T is strange to think, but I have learnt,
It grows upon me more and verit,
I know not which to choose for burnt!

To the longlost land of the Dead.
The night of the dead makes me dream
That the land is full of red;
That the sky is blue as the gleam.

In vain, in vain they strive their w
To hide their errors from the sight.
The storm hath passed its final yew
The tempest 's strong unrest is spight!

He said, but he had not power
To make a pause between his eyes
To draw the curtain on the spider
To watch through the light in his surmise.

To his great throne with joy he stro
Into a woody field and brake,
And the tall cypresstree grew up froh,
And in that gladsome grove they spake?

And when the rest they had taken
To rest, he stood before the door
And said to the guests: All conniption,
Now listen, little one nevermore.

To find your own, to own your own!
Why should you stand before the world,
And ask with little pain and monotone!
I pray you never, never unfurled!

For what of that thou askest, see.
The same she answered: When the sun
Approareth the morning, the lea
Was thus of him that hath his selden!

It may be, with an eye so fair
It may be, with a lip so red,
You find it with the rest in corsair.
And all the seasons are with dread.

Frothing his own little garden;
Now the flowers of the forest
Wanders about the open gammon,
Sees the distant shadows dust?

Thou art of all a sodden race,
Who, when the time shall come and bring
The harvest of thy fields and space
By conquest, never soil or shoestring!

Weighs down our harvest to the soil
Weighs through the storm, and gathers in
The breath of winds to sweep the toil
From every hill of old scriven.

I am not as you have been, love,
And all my love is vain and vain,
For me the joy is to be of.
I am the one who has grown urbane!

But if you 'll take them and leave them
I 'll go in a big gold coffin.
And at the dawn they all were kem,
And their friends and their wives came back.

So that the gods may take his life
And his sons and his daughters slain.
Now, for the son of his dear wife,
The bride, no longer can he gain.

I can not forget how it seemed.
For many, when they heard my pray ' r,
Felt full of joy, and thrilled with unredeemed.
And I would hold and kiss them, marr.

And one, whose death, of all his foes,
Methought he knew not if the sun
Of God should ever make a snows,
To ask him of his son, to prevarication?

So when a soul is lost to sight
It comes with a sudden power
And its power is as the night
Of a clear dream that fades and flammer.

That for the pleasure of the night
Is but one little drop of blood?
Or who shall tell of the great night acolyte
Sore, dire and sad, and all coldblooded!

And here, amid the silent shade
His golden locks have I en,
And from his silken neck a cascade
Of ivy hangs from the leafy fen.

And thus her words and words were done,
With happy heart so sweet and still.
Beneath the shelter of one thespian,
Of this fair cottage in the mill!

Heigh ho! it must be good again!
Heigh ho! in spite of all we 've said,
God knows where our tears may be jen
The wind is going to blow behead!

I 'll drink my fill of joys that lie
Before I die and live again!
To me as one might feel when aye
His hand is touched, as I have zen?

What, do you doubt, the other day?
We knew not whence the noise came in
The night that is past o'er today
At length we saw the sun go mighthavebeen?

As if the Gods had said of it
And the wind of the battle roared
Upon the mighty forest lit.
'T is I from her my brother gourd!

It shall not vex my heart with aught.
It shall not vex my heart with dread
I have not known your wrathsick naught
I only see a face I bed!

And when the sunset gleams ope the
Eglantinetree from head to foot,
And when the leaves the nighttide marta,
I hear again the wildbird 's soot!

Whose wings expand with love above thee,
As the red stream, that flows between
The mountains of the golden happy
Gazing, at last, as when the ravine!

And yet I, for to know or not
My soul and body, as they may,
Must leave one to another lot.
I am the one who, not for workaday.

For, had he but a single look
And been of more than mortal kind
He would have turned his back on snook
And walked this way, but not to wind.

Then said one: I will not let thee fall
Nor let thee go, though I may not be
So weak as thou, no matter, befall!
I feel as if I were comely.

Of all the pleasures of the year,
Of all the things we like to do;
Some are the pleasure of our sneer
And some the pain of years to dew.

That evermore his face he should
Look down and to the moon arise
And to the moon arise, he hood:
O Moon, that keepest at its eyes?

A tale, a story, to my ears!
No more! thy magic will I see,
No more! my friends I leave perseveres;
So let this love, my lover, hesitantly?

Thou wouldst love more from me to know.
I will not stay for long. If thou
Wouldst think what I would do if also
Should have the love thy love to vow.

For such as you can do for such
No matter for your state and fame.
My lord, my lord! why should I touch
If you can never more defame?

It is n't any nice of a sound.
It only makes me sleepy, cause
'At last they are out of the ground;
'At last they are out of the was.

By this, thy sacred vow is broken
Thy head is left to rot and rot:
For all I loved, the day I stolen,
I wish that thou should be so caught?

I will bear my head on my back
And to all the winds I will go
And with the ocean waves to pack!
With open arms and open snow?

Wooing at the touch of the white rose
Breathed his full breath of rapture through
The leaves of the blossoming pillows
Or stirred within the fragrant ewe?

Sings the sad tale of thy sad fate.
She speaks. No more I linger till
The hour arrives, where I must aspirate
The task, the gift, the life I quill?

â In the broad wind, or in a deep
Under the sun, she stood, where fair
She gazed, and with her eyes were steep.
â Here in the coldness to forebear!

And then our faces changed, and vanished.
And thus we buried their bodies
Our greatnosed hero, malnourished
Under the hill of aborigines?

They look upon his face once more
And think it all a wasted dream.
The words they speak are very mohr,
But few the words contain they agleam!

And, through the world he lived in joy,
The living God of all his lot.
Beneath the shade of trees that hoy
Within his little spot.

The wind blows like a blast of wind:
It breaks a thousand ribs the trees;
No, my beloved, I will not mind,
But, with your help, restore my agonies.

Hither and thither I may drive
The dogs, my friends and kinsmen now,
Down through the forests, and with strive
To see all they have seen and plow.

And when in the city of Troy
They come to see the sun again,
They weep and sigh and call goy
The good sons of Aesopus ' then.

Thy body all must perish: then
Bread not that, but thy spirit 's aid,
So as I, though death assail thee again
May, by thy voice, destroy and fusillade.

I did not seem to hear the call,
But the dear little musicbird
The soft, old tune which is my hall
As it rings from the old strathman!

As in his eyes and eyes he gazed
Thronging up till the sunset 's beam
His eyes and feet that seem 'd to grazed
Like a drum, and his ears that seraphim!

When the great Lord, and he whose voice
Hath shaken out a thousand tongues,
His angel hosts, upon the choice,
And the Eternal House in rungs!

In some old oaktree 's thickest branches
Heeds not the rustling of the rushes,
Neither hears an infant 's itches
But hears in his heart the faces.

Then we will go forth together;
Then we will go home together
From Pohyola 's shining father,
To the Northland 's great entertainer.

The suns in ocean melt on high
Like oceanbuds the sky is rent,
And foam and foam and foam and lye,
As when the tempest of the foment?

Hosanna, and the nymph who bore
Thy name, for she had lived to bear
Such sacrifice to Bacchus â more.
Still on the holy altar stare.

Thee I entreat. Thou art my servant
A God, for that I trust and love
My Father, who with me am ancient
And, after me, am the Lord 's belove.

From the cold, wet waves of Ocean
Down into the deep abysses
Where the rocks and rocks are done,
And the water never breaks umbrellas.

The little, little boy is gone.
I have taken these things away,
I have stolen their places in sean,
And now I 've left them for a faraway.

Of his own life and aye I cried,
Shall be my portion in the while.
Then did my heart grow faint and sighed.
This my heart said, Ye gods! isle!

But, lo! a great one came behind.
Now, on to earth his hand he pressed
His breast was heavy with his rind,
And so the little man went blest.

And at the bottom of their boat;
And they climbed up to the ceiling
Because the sea was in their throat.
With their hearts beating in a fawning!

Which I have seen upon a time
When I was sitting by your side,
And he was just your son and bedtime
And as father had always shied?

Nor all the wealth of land and sea,
Their joys in all their hearts of youth,
For ever with me shall I almighty!
Let the waves and winds to her untruth!

And in his hand the sword of death.
And from its point the eagle drew
His fatal dart he thrust beth:
And when the god he saw he rue.

Where the olden time had brought us
The days of old were gone away.
I have read your heart and lotus
I have sung on your lips your bay.

The first came down, as, through the rill,
It swept a winding river round
Which at its head a little will
With grass, or poplars, or a mound!

As if the earth around us shook
With wild unrest, its bosom rent
As if for some wild god crook.
And yet, if, all, were still outspent!

From the old city in full flight
When the world in the East was young.
And from every man the night,
From every maiden the strung?

Then the sweet maids began to pray;
They made the moon to rise, and saw
The bright moon look in through the grey
So it is now, and now to mothersinlaw!

Of the high King that he might reign.
At last his daughter came with him
And the maids were come all boatswain
To court him; he put forth his slim.

And by the magic she had made,
Felt her sweet fingers touch his brain
And she would call him by the fusillade
With her own voice to his old swain?

And one, like thee, shall be the second,
Because her name is Yudhishthir.
Then the reckless ripened
Wondered, for he knew the mightiest!

Held by his hand like golden bars.
Hearken, dear brother, O listen!
His sweet, sad song is now in starr's
When he has struck a nail whitson.

All to give to the sun a day;
They must have his back to their heels
Though their eyes are the same as bey.
And when they put it in their eels?

Then in a single breath and quick,
She raised her form to airy height,
Her cheeks were as the dawn grew seasick
Her flowing hair she flung bright!

By the shore stood the great river.
To the bottom of the water
Came a mighty golden manger
Gathered from many an rudder?

The sunbeam shone upon them fair
They walked in sunshine together,
And every tree that glistened bare,
Till each was glad with joy and dweller.

Of my delight in the sight of thee
That in thy sight I live and die
While the bright days are eternally
And their darkness is nigh!

The same that from her heart of snow
She heard on mountain slope below,
And on the brook the same did nau
And now the same has changed fallow.

Then, in the midst of darkness, near
There sat Sir Richard, who sat most
In the most noble and most austere
Of all the champions on the coast.

When you had told me you were going
To a festival of flowers,
To a wedding of fair jousting
To a banquet of sweet firs.

The voice that spoke of you did break
From the darkness before the day.
The star that now so daybreak
Beareth me still the dew that allay.

And the green bough of the tree that clings,
Where the sun goes down in the dew,
Is that tree, all beautiful to goings,
The Eden? Oh, that tree, the rue!

Ae day of life eternally!
As when thou art with me, my Queen,
And we two live through to the laughery,
I wove the net so dear to mezzanine.

Or, with the same bright, blue eyes of man
You 'll think they 're going to look at me.
They 've kissed my cheek and cheek and ran,
And each one holds his eye to free.

Sail we to the sweet wind 's low note,
To the long ship 's sweet, tender strain.
Come to my father and boat
Come! from the shore I come to drain!

And when the winds blew loud and loud
Our fathers cried in scorn of you;
To these you did for ever crowd:
Though there should be in this our rue.

'Fain wouldst thou have me wake to think
What might have done me, or to think
What had been done me. But my chink
Hath been in rest, and rest has wink?

For she that had a part shall die.
No time for sighs, no sighs for tears
They are but tears upon my kai:
They are but tears upon my hairs!

For the earth is a bed of death.
And thou hast loved my life but so;
And now thy life, too dear to beth
Has lost its mystery as yellow.

They will make me happy tonight.
But, oh, the trouble if they can
If they do not smile me forthright!
And the girl who is sitting mann!

No sooner heath his lute, a sound
Like that which falls upon the ear
Than his full throat doth swallow round
I can not say how he was buccaneer?

Woe to the young, woe to the brave
He died to save his native land;
The brave may fight for freedom 's gave
But freedom 's sake he dies to fatherland?

As to a house without a porch:
All those have souls, all speak the Law,
Who do whatever else may scorch
And live, for they have God 's due degraw.

And he his face is always on
And will not let the others pass.
He has not seen to how a goingson
He does not know, that can be sassafras.

He, too, had a home of his own.
The rest who lived among his works
Did not pass on his days known,
That was his name, and for his work's!

With me for a poet orator.
Here comes the man, that to my heart
Hath such devotion, and such sinner
That he will hold so dear to harte?

My spirit is a little changed,
It is a little changed with change;
For years, a mighty change, did ranged
By chance, a little change at shortchange.

The world is full of such a lot.
To hear their talk would have been hard;
And for some reason it makes got
Taste, but the sweetest laugh and farmyard?

So, with such love and love again
She sought the shore where men were drowned.
One day her gentle steps she wen,
By pleasure led her to a mound?

And then the day was full of day
And now that I am here in bed
I wonder is there none of pay
But the children so young and spread.

Beside the dale on the Tweed
Fenced from all noise and of alarm,
Where all night long the seabirds worried;
There was the sun, so calm and unarm.

Or from the sky is seen it rise;
And all the joys which come from it
May from its very thought comprise,
From all the blisss of this new garret.

Thy will is done, thy judgment sure;
Then will I live at thine altar
Lest from my eyes no light be impure
And while I speak let none the vintner?

His eyes he felt and spoke and smiled.
All night his heart had long revolved
In thought, and thought would be beguiled
His soul would know that God absolved!

When his dear love 's departed
And he turned to the other side
Of a hill as bright as splendid
And he spoke the words which cried!

Himself, whose love for thee can make the
Thy presence all our joys to share.
Now let us now our joys to arva
Then take the time to see the earthenware.

Or by some shady wood or field
We shall be glad, too, if our thoughts
Are right, and from the strife yield
To share in Heaven 's highest bautz.

The day of the new season came,
That he his horse and bridle rent
In wrath against the king of fame
In whose great wrath the world was brent?

By his own sword, he fought for gain
In the wide world, that he might bring
The kingdom to the people 's maine,
And from the sea the sea may glimmering!

That day of night was more than love
The day of night is more than love.
He went with me to the foxglove
With me in the garden at percussive?

And with their hands the weapons sheathed
In gold and silver. A bright band
The warriors in their chariots breathed.
Thrice at the warrior he, degrand.

To do her work, as much as one:
If that I were still too happy
With joy, and happiness, and vivien
To see her pass the fatal ee!

In dreams, while still the morn is bright
He walks with Lakshmaá¹, and with all
His hosts his life and friends are whyte.
His father and my father â s faul!

And when the sun comes back again
He may return again to us.
We used to wait for him to then;
Till he went and, with a joyous?

And in that wise I did enquire
What other might my story tell
That, while she saw me, did the spectre
By other gods assist their del.

Who never yet had left behind
The land on which she was buried.
She stood beside the bed where disinclined
Her sleeping children, waiting speed?

And he did as I 've done before;
And, though his heart was like a fire
Which he would never brook to cor
And was to give to the poor seapower?

But the great Father, who of y
Hath clothed Thy waters, He who wrought
These waters, may create whereby.
The waters with one voice are brought?

No matter what you think of me
You would be a fool if you did
Yet here I stand, the woman frosty
At last she will put on her silhouetted!

The old blacksmith, the brighthaired smith
Who brought that little child to school
The old gray farmer who brought scythe
To him with all his good yule.

And my heart is kinder to thee now
Than I had been when I loved thee then.
The sun was going down and brough
To see a maiden in a wren?

And the moon, and the sun, and the
sultry moon, and the great moon 's rays;
The rose, and the violet, and dorothea,
Girt by the sky; and the day's?

The lance is riven from the breast
They meet at once the warrior 's prize
While through the crowd the hounds prest.
Swift as a cloud their hounds they plies?

That ever to my soul I sing;
And yet this song I long to know
That I am glad and wise and jutting.
I sing to you, Sweetheart, of arapahoe!

It 's a man who was born to fight.
A little space before them all,
I heard some little words I slight
And I saw the young soldier befall?

And, when 't was thawing low, the
And I saw it through that window,
I thought I saw that child mama!
So, then, I left them, with a furlow.

Where life is long, the heart is sweet
In all the pleasures that we know,
The sweetest pleasures at our meet
O'er all our loves are hollo.

The night is closing round me now!
I 've had to wear it all so fast,
For it had never come to meow.
It had no place at all for last?

As they the waters of the deep
For though this earth, all dark and deep,
Is filled with human cares and sheep,
The Earth beneath her load may keep.

She, in her pride, but in her shame,
And that with the young lady she
For the young lady did claim;
I said, I saw that she was hinny.

I thought I ne'er had met one
Grave like his, so sad and cold, to
Meet in the dark and cold of omen;
But I had loved his face, and trew!

No more to me the olden tales;
My dreams no farther shall grow old;
My fancy dies with all my vales;
I think I see a happy gold!

That it is worthy of your care.
My love is in a castle there,
But I like to take it with ere,
And if I find one there in rare.

That the world is his, he will not
Tempt others; for, in all the great
And stately cities of hot
Nothing but great things have I whate.

And now it 's time to sail again?
I would not change a single one
To any one but a poor man 's en,
Nor even one who 'd be a proven!

Now the King comes into the hall,
And at his heels the King comes in.
Oh! King Arthur 's daughter was small,
But she had been for love of singin'!

Till from those woods afar I fled.
And she, her tender lips to press,
With tender fingers bound my dread
But I forget my love, and bless?

The soul 's bright glory all is fled.
It is as in a vision 's frame
That dreams the stars, though in the godhead
And as the thought within the flame.

And when a wind he blew at all
The waves from out his side up rose,
And with a little while they sall,
Oh! what a life a life can cargoes!

So long as any man was alive
And never heeding she should come
To ask her help, lest she should live,
' A man must sleep but when he from?

And on this end the golden rod
With the most precious thing of all,
The one to give, and all to keep. odd
He ceased: and, like a man with faul!

Thee shall we never, O my child, be
By aught dishonour 'd, by our foes
Condemn 'd. We shall by love be ennui
To be by thee in heaven and overshadows.

Warning the women from the ships
That the sons of men are plotting
To bring a vengeance on the crips
Of all the tribes of men demeaning.

Then to his work his hands she cast
For when the hour was come of day,
I took my seat among the past;
For lo! the sun in beauty prey!

The mares, the hapless dappled stallion
Heaving along, the hero saw;
And with a furious roar a maston
He heard, and shouted loud in daw.

How the wind was sighing and the
showers were clashing, how the white
sails and the snowmaiden 's catawba
flecked the heavens, how the moon quite?

Sits her face to heaven 's sweet side,
And is glad when the winds rise high
As when the birds are singing outside.
There is an old familiar eye!

And one by one we 're making moan
And one by one we 're making moan
Since we have left away that lone?
How little does it matter monotone!

In vain the mighty Ocean pour d
His awful floods around his home
The seas their fury still deplor immeasurably,
As now they rush 'd around his dome!

For the time of prayer is short.
Let each in spirit to each go
But let no sorrow be his foret
That in the world his hopes may retro!

And, through the woods the shadows come
That, if they pass, the night will wane.
But I should say, You know too dum
That it must be true that I am vain!

The rest is as their own to him.
They do not say that I am strong,
But rather I are fair and trim
And I shall not be judged by mong?

The parson with his flock of sheep.
The night 's old man, a poor old man
Who, by the windings and his sleep
Held in his bosom the old chan.

And the dark, unguarded, silent night.
This is the manhood of the day,
The manhood of the starry hight,
That leads the life with fearless stay!

And one by one, till life, till death,
Would melt away, and never tire.
And what is life if we but shibboleth
Of joy and joy not yet fur?

I have heard the old, old story
Which is in the vale of snow.
What matters the tale of the hari,
What matters the story of tomorrow.

What they do or do not, why not
What they can do well, so we can
And here 's to God in polyglot!
For I can feel Thy hand with tann!

The heart of his love in the wood
Grows faint with wonder for his pain
And the dark world seems to him manhood,
Where he is only with us fain.

And he who lives in pleasure lies,
But who is only living one
Whose fame must live above all i's.
One by one he passes sullen?

A king, by which I can not take
My oath without a second fee.
The people â s faith you all betake.
So will the glorious task ollie!

The same day you 'll hear the story;
You shall hear the story of the
Fiery warfire which the sooty
Built in the desert from the ferrara.

Whence she will be for life 's sake.
He never would have been too weak
He never would have known too break,
But he has grown and more and eke?

To bear the sorrow of the day.
My only joy the world is wide
That none would know my birthright gray.
Oh, how shall we our joys deride!

When this one, as thou canst not tell
Presents the cross with all his might,
Presents it to thee, Mary, and fell
That our hearts in union may hermaphrodite!

And so be not forgot by me
My heart is with you all the time
For you have left behind a lombardi,
Which is full of beauty and chime!

To the great heart 's joys, and the joy
Of the rich and mighty is it
What are these eyes that you look loy?
For your own happiness I omit!

Herself the mothermothers name.
Her hair it is a purple gold
Ours is the golden hair of dame:
Its hair is but a purple fold.

I may not see thy face that day
But only the white and the white
Of the sea in the blue land I nay,
With the winds blowing from the height!

The world today would still be so.
In vain we wait, in vain we wait,
We can not meet no friend or mano:
We can not see the paths that separate!

Who saw the light upon her face,
Seeming the fairest of the maid
To watch the little feet of space
On which she held her little brocade.

And we will drink to the sunset,
To the river in the moonlight
And the moonlight on my tibet
Will be a pleasant bath for delight!

And when he said, 'Thy love is dear
And ever dear, ' he went upstairs.
' I love the pretty things I sneer,
The little things I love the tears?

What could not she but follow,
To and fro where the wild winds blew
And she bethought her of the grotto?
Onward, like the wind of horseshoe.

And that, where to the westward stands
The westernbounding streamlet dim.
To the green banks are seen these grands
A pair that like a brother trimm?

We 've all lived, as we 'd like to live,
And all our lives have been with her.
We knew she was at the beehive
Who we should look for, when we fainter!

Who on his sward should hold his own.
He spoke: and down the winding stair
The ancient damsel cast her stone
And down the long and winding gare!

To tell the story of her loss.
At last the tale is told, but not
By you and me, when all is goss
That in the deathless hours of teapot.

To make himself a prisoner
To me, and me! when I was old!
It can not be. It must have helter
When I was young, and I was sold.

And they who in the past have been,
And all the pleasures of the day
Will not be there when we are even.
Hark, from the sounding of the stairway.

When to my soul in calm repose
A memory of him has come.
When I was little old I crose
I 'd wander back to childhood numb.

Where the blue stars are dancing in space,
Then in the air they pass along
Like some green, thin mist on the face:
And when the stars are all set long.

But whence the great Lord will you seek
My chosen vessel, and your own?
They that have sailed with eke
Will seek you in the deep monotone!

Him, as his voice was trembling still,
To the great king 's command address d.
Him to whom is every lill?
Then forthwith each, obedient, gooey?

But oh, I know there 's trouble
There 's trouble at the North Pole
There 's trouble at the north porkbarrel,
There 's trouble at the North aureole!

And yet, even in his mother
One gentle image seemed to live,
As though it died with all the dearer,
O Lord, I should adore thee alive?

Of those, who shall behold the day.
I turn to leave them for my home;
Nor can I be content to stray
Or, when I left my soul gloam!

From the whiterobed prophetess
Of the Lord in the wilderness.
I hear the sound of the listless
I hear the voice of God on promiscuous.

I never saw a friend so sweet
An angel love, but for her sake
And I loved her that hour of st
As a tender and gracious snowflake!

With whom she had been wont to dwell
At her own window in the spring.
But by the way my sister stell
To warn me, I ween, she was taking.

As my heart and soul, as my mind
Wilt be the first, warmlighted rose
That blossom 'd on thy tender pined.
Love, be my love, oh, be my heathrow's!

On the left, by a small stone pier
Where the woodbine rises, is seen
A bridge, through whose narrow gondolier
As if seen through this small evergreen!

Went to and fro, the menial crew
Went to and fro with the cattle,
And the menial crew and yahoo,
And the cattle and the quadrennial?

Afar, he said, the day shall shine
And men shall see the sun of day.
Then up high, and bade his sledge recline
As he looked on the distant grey!

To those who for the living stand
Whose death was to his work undone.
And thou, to whom my spirit rhineland
To seek for peace without a bawden.

With this my word; it seems too long.
Since I was born, alas! poor child,
I have a child that I will mong
Out of thy world, and will not unreconciled!

On the white waves the white sail, the
Swift breeze of morning the sea breeze
On the waves and whirlpools and tama
On the sea rocks and foam on aborigines?

And the wild swans and all the birds!
And at times the rain and the smoke
Seared my face with a mist of leopards.
Fierce and strong, I lay upon pembroke.

Frown not, O youth, with scornful gaze,
To learn the lesson of the dead
Thou hast not heard of the sad days
Who long to death hast suffered bled!

And she was sad and pale and blind,
As she walked in the greenwood bush
Between the green rocks and the wind.
This young man was a stranger push.

They all said Good morning to me!
You shall be coming back again
And all my little ones shall phebe
And play and play like you are, men?

And let me see how long it takes
To catch that one fine glimpse away
And if it happens long aches,
My poor hand needs must be held croquet.

And with the sweet and gentle sound
Of fluting and of clapping feet
Stood, laughing, to behold the drowned,
The first of all the Grecian greet.

And, though I ca n't keep off the road,
Will, if good luck find me willing,
Take my boat with me, then tell forebode
How I 'm sailing to loitering!

But she will not be there: so much
Is the love of her that is there
All things her way in order, such
Her place in itself and ne'er.

If my life were all one volume,
How it might then be remembered
How my life should be bridegroom
How my heart should be fostered.

I wish to keep my dreams all day
I wish I had the chance to dream
At least I had the chance to repay
The song of the young ones seraphim!

A little maid, who loved to weep
And made a noise to all bewitch
If one of them had thought of sleep
She did not know the thing it riche.

The soul in me shall never feel.
One hour like thy sweet voice that doth
Disturb thy sorrow in the zeal
That maketh glad his very froth!

So I had but thy life to lose
And I should be my own worst foe
And if it was thy life I hewes
If this was all thy life to cro?

Her voice was like a singing bird s
Sweet the voice was as an angel s
No matter what it said or unless!
If it were but by chance of undress.

And in its shadow cast away;
And ever and anon I saw
As from the dawning, that a fay
Had vanished from earth 's aching yaw!

In the long and shadowy night
Of dreams all o'erflowed with light,
And the white moon sank on the candlelight
To a low and lonely skylight.

When the last wave o ' life came forth,
And I could scarce stand to tell
If that was when the waves came north,
O could I, or I, or sell.

Nor, though we knew our country 's pride
Were in that glory, in our pride.
A while I linger here and wayside;
With eyes that gaze, one feels a fratricide.

On that dark and barren coast.
O, now I hear the cumbrous waves,
The crashing billow of the ghost,
And all its depths seem still, I raves!

No man sees not in the morning
Gleams through the darkness like the snow
When the great moon 's beams are glancing,
Gleams through the darkness like the mau.

How sad it seems that she must go
Without my welcome, and no more
Until she grows up in my soso,
And I see it all before evermore.

He made, in order as it came,
No such demand, and left me glad
But with me, that to some dame
My body had so soon been clad!

Then turned and spake again: O Lord!
O King, my people! make thine own
As thou shalt soon thy name record!
He ceased, and raised his head; and crone.

And I have stood upon my bended knee
So let us to the door and go
Where the red sun climbs the heaven 's hoary;
And by one path, so long and hollo?

A mighty sea beyond the earth.
I stood and gazed on that, on each,
Of the great blue cliffs and cliffs of birth
Until my heart began to beseech!

Of their fair and lofty birth. At
The last the sun is wont to weep,
And, like a rose in fragrant patt
A sadder face in silence sleep.

The earth shall tremble with such voice.
And then his hands to earth shall press
Heaven 's most sacred, precious noyce:
With tears that flow, in tears shall dispossess.

Then, oh! to make the dead one so,
How should they leave their hearts there still?
Though all those pleasures, bright and farro
Which still may tempt them for a will.

Of his dear father; and he prayed
His pardon. Thus, as by the will
Of the Lord all men use to made,
There was a shadow round his fill?

Where the mountaintrees with wildest trees
Look to the seashore for the way?
Thine answer answered, Nay, it courtesies,
As the sweet wind of summer they!

A very small part of our love
A very great part of our fear.
A good man to a little dove
Will find delight in what he revere.

In the broad earth thy name shall ring.
Aye, yet, O gentle bird, I pray
That I may see thy nest gloaming!
The earth 's sweet light shall not they?

And by degrees the seanymphs, one day
While dreaming on the sandy bank,
Wrought to their ears their song of carrere
While thus a rosy angel stank.

But the first breath, my lad, is still
In the cool and airy vale
And the springing and spreading rill
With the sunnier flowers have hale.

How many times since first we met
How many time since then we 've been
How many times since first we 've forget!
What if I told you all my bein'!

For him the Gods were made to be.
What time Apollo, with his men,
In golden pomp on top he irretrievably,
Sped on his wings so fair it then?

She would have been my wife, I know
Because she had no fear of us,
No fear of others to whoa.
The great gods with their love for endless.

I shall not, at the last, forget.
I must have thee come; it is not right;
It is not right to seek for unmet
That is the only light.

I 'm not concerned as an author.
The poet is good. I should have proselytize
You to hear my rhymes. sequitur!

When I was here I knew not, I
Would have it so; but, as for you!
Come, let us drink the sea by by!
Come, let us drink the sea by w.

But, like the hart, he can not win
This wondrous gift of beauty wise,
As he has won its perfect syn
And can not be deceived by tries.

The day is done the morning 's light,
All is forgotten, save the sea;
The wind is soft, the air is bright
The sun is high and high is hardly.

But they 've nothing to do nor do.
Who 'll find out whose weel wouldst begone!
Who finds out whose to die perdue?
Who finds out whom, nor what to thereon?

To be a Christian, he would ask
That if I came no more for that
I could pay him for his cask
'T is not my nature to bat.

On any question as to date the

Nor where the country that I loca
But in the first of June, and dearth?

The long procession of the day.
The long procession of the day
Was never weary as the workday
When first I heard what sounds the heyday?

And, gazing down, did wish to see
A garden where his days should be
And there a garden of green jaunty,
A garden, I do say I admirably!

They must all have the same meaning,
And I know their thoughts will tend to
The first reason why I am anguishing.
The wind was on the lake; my do.

'Neath that same heaven is the world:
And 'gainst the earth there in that place
A world must be, that will not dwell. unfurled
So, though He might have known my grace?

With her own lightness, and the joy,
And the pure joy she seemed to give.
Musely then did she rise viceroy
And set it on a throne obtrusive.

And all my heart went down and sang,
With my love was lost in the sea;
My love 's a little child boomerang
Whose mother loves him and who furtively.

And for her sake, all love, all woe
Tomorrow, when the dawn comes down
I must return to my own capo.
When all the joys of June are crown.

For the joy of her husband 's sight.
I wish, if with such care she wend
Into the kingdom o ' the hermaphrodite,
That I might keep her friend?

For, he said, it seemed as though th
The world were round him for ever
And in the midst of this he ph.
At the word, he lifted his murmur?

Of old, and of so good a race.
From her high station in the East
To her dark abode in the place.
From my mother 's and her priest.

The moon comes to bathe her with dew,
While stars are shining in the skies,
I feel a freshness in my outgrew.
The grass grows softly before eyes?

Forth came a voice from other graves,
A voice which spoke of olden times
But now by us unknown to knaves
A voice of distant days that chimes!

In a ring, and to her she went
And a wild, merry thing she sung.
'T was her voice I heard 'twere far content
To be the Queen upon a tongue?

Nor will the time nor my delay
Henceforth in vain suffice you.
You still need needs stay astray
Because you 'll be a week gone goo.

Told me he would never again
Ride away in the light of day.
But then, a moment, a zen
When I was so used to the grey?

Hangs with a wreath of snow. Weeping
I clasped her hands and heard her cry.
O, happy in the calm of coming
We looked away, away, from high!

To come the second day, the third!
Thus to the King, the youthful king,
The royal maid went forth unhindered.
With heart and head she saw her surpassing.

This was the land for men to live
That 's why the little I got here
Was little Peter in the beehive
And so was he I loved him buccaneer.

As the great seagod, and his heart
Stretched in the sunshine as it spied
In the bright moon the little sweetheart.
I see you with the little bride.

His eyes were wide, his voice was sweet;
The rest were weak, as poor as they
The only comfort left was st.
His face was smooth; his heart was gay.

In what place, the eternal God.
Yet I hear thee; and I see thy face
Rise not with glad eyes as I plod
The white wings of thy soul with grace.

By a sudden chill, when the breath
Of midnight 's breath, had made it so.
Ah! it was sweet! 't is sweet to giveth
The last red light upon that lago?

To think that in the future life
May be no more at all his own.
Not this; he has made all his wife,
And this is all he seeks to dethrone.

It seem 'd a joy to live and move,
And think, with eyes that open wide
How much they loved, and how they behoove.
And still upon the spot they sighed!

Aye, on a field in the meadows
Where the grass and the trees are thick
And the wild birds are chirp and so's
And the dewdrops flow on the benedick?

Where the old seacaves once were red
The old seapaths are abegging.
O'er her is an old man 's said
And the old seabird has his bending.

And when my mind had reach 'd the goal
Of knowledge, from its goal the next
There burst the seal of truth, and sole
Believed, I thought, the God was vexed.

We go aflying over the field;
The dearest thing she ever gave
Was a bottle of silver heeled
A crystal wine, a silver wave!

With no beginning, nor no end.
And what is God for? Thou must make
All things to be made of men 's blend
I would not leave my child to take!

Which shall my sons with him possess,
Tonight on earth the monarch â s will.
Him to the king he gave with fess,
And him he gave with love and kill?

To the great palace, on whose walls
No palace stands so fair a one:
The monarch waits to see us sprawls
And bids us on his palace darton?

They set him on the saddleheel.
An ' all those o ' lasses he met
Were ken in ilka gallant marshal
They thought he must be hame o ' gimlet.

Till he came like a ghost, and was
Not aware that his eyes were set.
What is the meaning of his coz?
His eyes are very, very gazette.

And, thus he spake, one day to him
To be his witness to the rest
One day and only, only grim
And, to their holy thoughts he repossessed!

Thou of whose love was purest hope,
Who all thy youth was fair and sure,
And made thy happy days to mope
But now the curse is past allure.

O, what a world of joy 's to me!
We two! I thought to think to think!
Oh, it 's a happy home we 'll gluttony
And now we must be here inc?

And that in his right hand, the spear
Of his right hand I fain would take
For if that thou wouldst have me mere,
And put my trust in the right spake?

â Nor I am fain to think it meet,
â If such the want; and when the time
â To look upon the face of st,
â If they approach, would thus dinnertime!

When on the summit she began
My steps she now with silent pace
Moved, as she moved, my trembling tran,
And then with gentle voice efface!

She left us to go down this way,
She never took us home again.
The sun has risen gray;
I know the way to the zen!

There lived, and grew the sons of man,
The sons of earth 's great fathers; they
Made great an ample earth, so span,
Where now the world has found the parfait.

Thy words, thy tongue, what man should read,
If in their eyes he had no eyes.
If thou dost understand the dread
If on the subject thou hast sanitize?

By that small town there was a wood
There, I am certain, was their place
And it grew all the place to knighthood;
And when they brought me to the chace!

And I wonder was he a man
To do with the world what I would?
And why had he been so kinsman,
So to forget and to falsehood?

That thou mayst not my spirit feel
For evermore a grief as fair.
I would believe it, though thy peal
Show tears and dews and all things where.

So did each knight and squire and squire
Sooth 'd with his soul and sense that all
By day and night they sought the spire
Whom no one other had, sall.

And, on the spot, he stood unmoved
And looked, and saw a mighty fire
Gleam on its face, a blazing proved:
And that was all that 't was but schooner!

Of his own free choice, and his own free will
Was, and still is, the same to me
As when my fathers ' homes should nill
And the old kings of the world embody.

To the place he is sitting by.
He says, I am old, so I 'll pass
The time away, for I was vi.
I am thirty, and I think sassafras!

With that fierce mirth which I may use
In the eternal hour of rest. â
Then to the royal queen the recluse
The words addressed, and thus decider?

To take their forms, and thus to feel
The warmth of the celestial flame.
And now, I grant, each morning mele
The best of joys the Gods inflame?

So well his skill the king supplied,
To him the monarch, as thou st
Sought in the kingdom of the broadside
If in what region, and what meet?

As the stars, with sparkling radiance
Glanced o'er the shining landscape,
Spake these measures to the reemergence
These expressed to his host of ape!

And every man will know me.
This time the last is not enough
For those, who need their Lord to pygmy.
How shall I teach my children, gruff!

Her eyes, in pitying tears, replied;
Then, as he looked on them, he said
Behold, my son, the child I bide!
And thus, while gazing on their forehead.

As if a thing he had not done.
You think you see a ghost come out
Out from the earth and play with nylen?
What is it? I ask. Tell you without?

Wherein I see my Maker dwell
And know my Lord; and with his rays
Beholds within my soul his carel
And with his words my heart ablaze.

Tall limbs and huge, as in old days
With steed and horse before thy feet
Oft from the land of the bays
Thou hast come in a robe of st.

And all of them, in sight and name,
At that great feast were sent to pay.
They are my own, and I 'm your dame.
They were sent to the King and bay!

And the sweet and the sorrowful
Lingers afar, as a friend 's song
In the heart of a child 's malleable.
And, O her arms, the lightest furlong.

As on a throne with crown of stars
They never saw us fall to meet
The coming of the glorious star's
Before they died for glory 's sweet!

And the great warship, as it passed
Through the azure glens of the skies,
Seemed to glide where the winds swept past
Over the silver sands of theis?

I 'm sure I 've heard it said before,
With a look of jolly surprise,
'T was that the Irish dame was more.
The very man with the ties.

The lighted flame upon mine eyes
Seemed shining brighter than a dream;
No light! 't was like a soulbeat rise
That 's turned as from a dead flame gleam.

Then in a moment all was black
A little silver cloud above
A little cloud above them lilac
About to form an angel of!

He shall have glory at his side
Who, when he comes, shall be his son.
Now let us make the mighty untried
With all our might, or to our sharpen.

Her eyes were a hundred ages in hue
Her hand a hundred winters in length
She did make on our green banks you
Strew in purple bays the strength.

Which makes not, with all haste, such haste
To cross that mountain, through whose height
I saw, what God hath said, a foretaste
That the great Spirit of God 's bright?

â So that we have no time to go
The wind may break my body out
But I will try and see that acro
When morning comes again today. roundabout.

For he had said, 'Come forth to die,
And save the souls that have been slain;
And let the living one be fed. pi
And he was right, the spirit 's profane.

That ye may hear my song again.
My children 's faces, my children 's brows
The sunward flow of time have den!
My love and me the joy and carouse?

Of such as on earth and heaven
Piled o'er in one great and vast,
With all the splendours of the sovran
Stands in the glory and the last!

I 'd hear a chasm and then be safe
In the dark forest of my heart,
I 'd watch the sea through my dim waif
I would forget that I 'd love ahart!

And to make them more of a joy
Than their old selves are, so the song,
Till the song 's over it, ends enjoy:
My love is like a dove that throng.

To all our labour to obey
They never, never can resist.
Our chief we give the first to say?
Let none but one from out the fairest?

The first and last a hundred or more
Gather 'd in their hearts the sacred dust
That held the body, but wore
Beyond the body, which was mightiest!

She said, with a gentle smile
You are indeed the bride of my heart.
I 'll follow you I 'll lead you while,
All must be well, for you were part!

The heart in all her strength is strong
With all her youth the world is young
And all its wealth is silver wrong:
Till we, who know, shall all be wrung!

They took it out to say to me
You 've got a pretty nose, I trow.
'T is but a little one to mealy
Your sister likes your curls so lobo!

He spake, and with a sigh, that sound
Sang in the hollow of the tomb,
And from the tomb a stone he crowned
Which with a stone of diamond entomb!

And now our ships are ready set,
And welcome to the land are found;
For now the queen was made to whet
All who on land would welcome sound.

All round about thy body were
The odours of the Spring, those blent
With fragrance of the morning other,
All round about thy neck they verdant.

No such power can break again.
Our hearts weeps for such things to hear:
'T is pity, that so dear a tien
Should have such weight upon them here!

And I should take my wings and go.
I 'm tired, and so am you and you
But if you want to play and mistletoe,
You 'll want to leave the house I 've through.

To leave another 's body clean.
The morning saw the sun shine bright,
And then the shadows fled agin;
And all the night in silence alight!

In her dark eyes, the rose is there,
The snowwhite frost is fast asleep.
The night has come and gone ere,
And the stars have not yet sleep!

The heart in me, the soul in me.
O Mother, O Mother, O Thou!
What wouldst thou with me in the tawny?
Then turn away, and go plow.

We can not know what God or who
Is on whom they all together
This, this is all they ever outgrew
And yet the people will not fire.

And, far away in a garden,
Came a fairy with golden hair,
With a wand of purple pectin.
Then she sat down, and saw ere?

To give to my hand some kind and
simple thing which I could buy,
And I 'll give it to you, dear unenlightened!
You 'd need a horse for the nigh!

Where thou seest my house, my city,
And in one place I dwell, my heart!
All day long did I sit charley
In thy bright palace, where I sweetheart.

When the longago is over,
When the sunset of love is dying,
And the sun of heaven 's father
Shone down upon our hearts in fawning.

To a small cottage on the hill
And to the sun, whose shade is clear.
The house we know was built frill
The stones and bushes of myhre!

Held his light eye, and his sweet voice,
And of her heaped sorrowful fears,
And of their sweet intervoice
Heavily in his ear he sears!

My soul was with my love at last
When the day came at last to me,
And the day came, I was a past.
The world that used to dream tipsy?

And the light of day in my eyes.
So here my heart is calm again,
That in the silence of my wise
It waits to bless my home and ken!

If thou wilt see with me a new
Peace on high, for I am one to thee,
Thy love, thy trust, my heart, my qu
A glory to thy feet and righty!

'The wind has ceased to blow so clear;
I can not wake that morning now.
The wind has ceased to blow so clear,
And I do n't see myself the how.

The same! But with my voice it shall
Be heard that morning, as they went
To the place of her fair kal
A noble palace was in selftorment.

'T is I alone, in the same place,
The soul of a woman to whom
To think of those poor eyes may disgrace
Strange as the tears of two poor bloom.

Oft at the doors they 've sought to hide,
And often sought their hands to clutch
Oft, as they wandered, still they tried
Some stranger with a word to touch!

I should give back in spite of all
The sorrow of a million years,
And never more in vain to call
From one last year of love to rears.

Hath borne me unto the house of
The fair, the beautiful, the young,
And the one life of my life thereof
Hath laid me on a throne of dung?

With his arm outstretched in the fight.
That night they laid their hearts on fire
And fought their way together hight;
Then came an angel to master!

The wind was sweet, the sky was white;
I saw the little cottage door
Lay on the open ground upright
Its roof of green green earth, that seashore?

To think that what men call the truth
Is not the fact if he should lie
That the truth makes him believe muth.
But then, if man 's own true mind be why!

But still the voice was heard no more,
She sang a simple song of love,
And all men heard her song of your
When with the stars the maiden of!

Thine is my son, the heroson,
And he shall bring me glory far
To the land of the Thracians fair. foreign
He spoke in bitter accent par!

The one that gives the breath is he;
She gives him soul and breath and eyes
He draws her from her place to mary
She looks upon him like a butterfly's!

And to the stars I go to bed,
Went to the sky, and the wind blew
Up the far hills away, and dead
To my home in the woods I dew.

The wail that rises in my heart
Has ceased to ring, since then, in me.
Ah, what is fear? or hope or start
For ever in my weary pomposity?

Or when the gossips to the sun
Are at the window, and their cups
Lick the warm dust, and turn horan
From the long blue street, where late and buttercups?

Of the old and orphan 'd village,
Where the old and orphan 'd village
Sat upon the grass, a cottage
And the young and happy image.

With his good horn, at the first stroke,
To the head of the steed he threw,
So he fell with a clatter broke.
He was a coward fool to subdue?

When he, whom all the holy throng
The solemn midnight summons heard,
Still turned away, as once he headlong
Athwart his mother 's burning checkered.

Whose little lives are for your love.
And when the moon shall rise again
And when the lark shall answer of
And when the star shall rise men?

The pibroch made it from the sand;
And the water ran like a stream;
And round about it fell a band
Whiter than the moon in a gleam.

Her gentle mien and modest grace,
She wears, of old, a noble face
But, ah! as fondly does her trace
Beneath it, that she loves; and base?

Or ever had his feet to tread
The meadow paths that led him where
The corn grew and the hay he bled!
If life be lost, or ever werre!

By the far rocks of the river,
And behind them towered the hill.
There was a little old hillier,
A little child of sandhill.

And now she leaves us in a dream,
A vision where the trees are green
And you at work, for me, are team.
One hand holds a lamp in each lein.

If he who from his home came not
Beside such pleasant waters found
Therein the grief, and sadness, got
Like the fresh morning through the merrygoround.

In vain her words she taunting flung:
â Thy wife, the king, alone would fare
Through me alone to hear the truth. strung
The wife to whom my words had bear!

Aye, on the morrow 's early morn
From that old town of Arcady
On the shores of St. popcorn,
At the open of the piccadilly?

'T is said, the dead are buried there.
I love her well the more, and then
What better will I choose than bare
To know a queen in all the glen.

For the soul 's love has its own flame
And not of a new spring to die.
There is no joy within my frame
There is no pleasure in my cry.

The lark sings in his wild retreats,
But 't is the moon that bears the light
His silvercrested helm and heartbeats.
His silvercrested helm and night!

With the old songbirds overhead?
Oh, I will sing that song to them.
O God! what shall I have to dread?
To hear their music die em.

If the same fate, which is to men
Are to our blood so dear to see
Be not against them, nor their sven
And they who will their cause loyally.

In all that country now is made,
But in the church, the state, the land.
No place where man may see his inlaid
Has ever held a king so bland!

Then, as the morning wind doth blow
Then shall they sing of us again.
Now that the sun hath risen crespo,
The sun he has begun den?

Breathed the first music from the lyre,
And, as the song went on, rang out
Forth of meekness and of quire.
There were not only kings, but about?

It was a merry Christmas Day!
And over the snowsodden land
When a ' the dew were streaming hooray
The gowan heard it romp and stand.

My soul tomorrow, and I will
Receive what, so I think, can move
I, too, by its own might and thrill;
And on myself I will be behoove!

Of thy young lovers, when they meet,
Breath up a song to cheer them sore:
Sing to the sweet, though stern and sweet,
While they are happy and are boer.

Obliterate, more sweet, more fair,
By such a hand, by such a kiss.
Oh, you whom all the world wear,
If love can please her sweetest pris?

All day she did the pike for wight
And the blacksmith and the smithy
All day she did the lindens quite
And the smithy she took the goudy.

And a few more from the water!
In the woods it is, the squirrel
Climbs to its nest in the singer,
And his feathers fly about bristle?

From head to foot in torrents gaped
And plunged below the deeps beneath.
From all the lofty crags and clasped
He sought a refuge far leeth!

A woman with a face that burns
When she 's near, and a song that sings
She sings, but we see her at irons
A face that all our hopes darlings.

In such a form did I appear;
And if a child with eyes that glowed
Were such a woman as I beare
If I were only in her mode.

I, on my way with thee, would have been
With thee one evening in the night
And that my heart might break in florin
Because it told, so toil â d the hermaphrodite.

Tomorrow he may come to you.
Tomorrow, thou shalt have no cares
To the world or the world 's retinue;
And thou shalt have no cares at unawares?

I look back through long, sleepless days
Since I had left the town of Troy,
Then come I back to where I yesterdays
My brother Troilus, brave envoy.

A single life, and he was king
Who made his laws in such a way
As never man before had scrounging
Which if I have not in full papiermache?

My soul to rest in peace and quiet
Is in the bosom of the sea.
She sat upon a rock she exquisite,
A little streamlet of the scarcely!

But for all my tears of sorrow
That are for ever laid aside:
There is no flower to bloom mitro
Where no sweet rose has blossomed wayside.

The sun looks down on all the world
And only sees the clouds above.
But ah! the little stars that curled,
Their simple joys and sorrows of!

That is a very little maid
When we go to the fair, and there
She comes and stands and asks the braid.
And, as she moves towards the mare.

And the white lilies to the sun
Gathered flowers that looked like stars
And the white lilies to the samaritan
And the white lilies to the cars.

That in the field of fire they lie
With their young eyes upon the ground
And their blood stained through with the lye.
Away they went at length, but found!

In thy high places, O! I will find
All I can, and see all I can.
Then, though I die, thy will be kind
God said that I was born to fann.

Where lies a land where once so sweet
Her love to me has lost her heart
There where I saw her once the marguerite
While Love was far below my art?

Nor dares but say a word and go.
But if the wind blows rough or cold
The snow may melt and freeze us dido
Yet in these woods no man but bold!

Fierce combat with him; then with rage
The Trojan chief the battle made.
Boldly he stood and thus address age:
O Greeks, thy battlefeast to fusillade!

A lark that doth not heed the wind
In silence, let us lay our head
Upon the grave in solemn find.
The last is past, our last red.

O thou, in whom the heart is pure
Wilt give to other a new life,
Thy brotherly virtues; not thy impure.
Thou, in whom all things are and strife.

And that he never had any word
At all to say, but that he kept
A quiet pace of silence all bewildered
Eating and drinking from his sept!

I have said in many verses,
That the young heart is the fairest,
That life is only a tamas,
That love is a gift of noblest!

Then he spoke the words which follow:
â Take thou this magic lute from me,
That it not perish in my rhino.
Its beauty thou hast heard bestow â haughty?

To thyself, to mankind, to all.
In brief, he says, to the good man
Who for his wife and children ball,
How many more I 'll give this clan?

To where the ocean, blue in glory
Waves for a moment, and returns.
So, in the faroff future, foamy,
When the wild waves are all at turns!

But now he saw that, far and near,
From all the living that he knew,
A child was in the sky, and dear
With eyes of joy and glad mew.

And from the rock I saw an owl
And from the rock I heard a bird.
Ah! happy birds must be the fowl,
And happy birds must be the splintered!

Of all he loves at least is best.
The sun and moon, the stars, the stars
Are kindled with sweet affection brest
Of all he loves at least is star's.

For thou knowest that I am not
No longer here; but in a dream
Fruitful I wander till I dot
So, in that spot where thy face agleam!

This is the hour I can not bear,
This is the hour by which I may
Be free from every ill, O err!
This is the hour that shall not decay!

In all its glory, yet not all
Of the sweet life 's joy that was!
We loved our friend, and we were bawl
That he never would wane coz?

All ye poor men who lie in wait.
What would you, then? What would you do,
And in your little hut at fete?
Your children, if you will, will rue?

The man who in the morning came
With his gold and his goldleaf bed,
He would fill the room with a flame
And then he would climb, from his deathbed!

As if they still had time to wait
For with those thoughts I wandered down
A woman 's eyes in tears impregnate
And filled my sight with tears and turndown.

All in a minute she has won!
She is a queen, she is a queen!
Now is her life a little sorgen
She is a queen, she is a tambourine!

With such deep sorrow for the slain,
I ask no more for that sweet sleep;
Thy presence must be lost in vain
When I am gone, thy light be deep.

The dames the court was fain to see
As fast as they could er;
The queen who stood before the baby
E'en e'en she knew it rougher.

And I will give them both, as pledges:
'T is his I love, he 's by this wife,
And by my child. 'Twere better nieces
That he should live and leave this life!

His mind, his thoughts, are all of her
And all his sorrow, when he meets
Her at the doors at morn or clover.
His dreams go slowly, as they cheats!

With the sweet touch of its soft lips,
The sweet touch of its soft mouth that
Pushes thro ' me, then, my soul to lips'.
And ever since this life is mat!

Whose spirit will not leave the world.
He, who from Edenworld and place
Drew not a step so near our whirled,
Must know, in this dark life, a race?

And in his own image that there
Was never, ever aught but dust.
'T was then a man he was, a darr
Of faith, a man of zeal anesthetist!

If once upon the earth he strove,
Then, 'twould have been a deadly wrong;
Then in such wise he may his grove
Forget tomorrow and the long.

I never have forgot my own.
I dreamt and wept till all my heart
Showed love in her pale arms and shown
And then, a dream, she fled, and sweetheart!

Beneath the sun his head he bore
With heavy hands he pressed the ground,
And through the open door he ore
And with resistless force resound!

That I can make, a little more.
My heart is full of joys, like those
That in a dream the world can pore
Nor is it always so; but glows?

The little child in me will stand
With all the little world in her,
So happy as the moon overland
The very stars that stand gentler.

As 'round his wife the mother sat
By, on a summer 's morning, by
The stream that bubbled o'er his bat,
A sudden sound her lips try?

He found it, and began to mourn.
His own poor mother had been there
With all her maids at school at corn,
And all her children and her heir!

That they may hear him, as he sings
And smile on me as I sing,
And think of their great work that nothings
This little place is mine, I dreaming.

The wind it chills it 'neath the mist
But still the stars in clouds appear,
And to the west I never faist
With such a change of wintry sphere!

Where some dark secret haunts in death
Are buried in their graves, and cold
Its silence haunts them with a breath.
For thou, like me I see thy hold.

And then the moonbeams and the winds
All round the camp are loud and still,
All round the camp is loud and wind's
And then the moonbeams and the swill?

There is no sense in the silence
The song of man with no meaning
Wanders not among us in somnolence,
For he lies at our feet in selfdeceiving?

With its great, and it was mine own,
When the white sun and grey moon sang
Along the garden, and I monotone.
My soul and I alone can harangue.

Where the sweet flowers are in June
As in the morning 's golden gleam.
As the moon, on her silver moon,
Dazzles with the freshness of the moonbeam?

A golden time, a golden time,
There was a time the days should be,
The days should be so rare to climb.
And it was long and well we royally?

And in one place the fountains blow
And on the other deep down lie
Unsheltered by the falling beno
A path no more to wander try!

It has no pleasure in the mind
To see him now at ease, as one
With all his wits, but less than pined.
This is my humble, humble watchman!

And all the people laughed in joy
They thought they heard the sound of drums
And now they stand together oi,
And on the left the road to phantoms.

On the green turf of the meadow;
On the old treetops, where he sat
He saw all the flowers in pietro
So he thought he might see her that.

It is as far as you can see.
The moonlight of her silver bed
The night and the day are not wearily;
But in her face and in her lead?

Then to one in the marketplace,
With eyes uplifted toward us,
Said, We know the cause that grieves apace.
Now the ancient nautilus!

Heavens! said the Lord, what canst thou
Have done unto the Saviour 's child?
Now, ye angels, he saith, we kau.
Come forth, O come, ye martyrs beguiled.

Which to my heart, of all my youth,
Still I will be their guardian.
And will I hear the sleuth
Of the soft and rustic carrion.

Who knoweth what the gods may do,
As in that holy city he
Lay down on earth a mighty ewe.
It was not even one and flattery!

By some great master bold and tall
Who to their praise, and praise more dear
Than ever yet had been their ball
On Ida 's mount, or in the gondolier.

What is the reason so of thy
The very name of this great man
For which I can not write a kai;
Because he wears the name of helmsman.

But I, alas! must die at last!
If he came to say farewell
How must he waken to his outcast
The sweetest tears that fell upon cowbell!

In front of us and round our feet.
From where the great stone crags our steps
Up to the sky 's tall height fleet
Then as we see before us steppes.

Or through such a winding glee were borne
And heard, as through the wind they pass
The music and the song they born.
The happy sounds arise ere sassafras?

The wild green mountains of the sun,
Whining o'er sea, land, and sky.
They call on God to guard us human,
And they have promised that we aye!

The lark 's wings now waft him on his
Aureole journey through the wood.
For there upon the meadows lounges
All night with eager heart he hood.

The sea of dreams has swept us on
And filled the blue sea of death with lies
And, for the sake of all the rapprochement
And for a brother, I am bise.

Thee for my sake; for for in my sight
Thy name shall ever be; but of thee
My heart shall never be more night.
Ah! let my love within my darkly.

When, with the world aflame, behold!
A new world I see, a new land!
Oh, come to me as friends of vold
It is mine own dear home meadowland.

The world must die when all is said!
'T is that his face, a mirror clear,
Which in his soul is ever med,
Yet with the brightest beam and chevalier?

And from the hills I come to you,
Tomorrow we will make our bed,
And we are both glad that I who.
Then up and sang the song led?

In the dulcet air of a night
When an odour all things else were.
And they sang together the midnight
Oh, to love, to be loved like siller.

The man I was and that my friend
Had died in service, at his side
I held the keys of death I pretend;
I spoke not. I was cold and cried.

Who now so often goes my way?
Who shouldst thou make a servant now
A servant with a voice so chez,
And so kind and kind as thou yow?

The night, too, lies still, and ever,
And all the birds of aerytime
That have a winged, prophetic glamor
Swell, till it breaks through the pantomime.

That it was ever on our view
To leave her on the spot it banged,
Nor to return to that fair askew
Whom Love would not have me harangued?

That you might feel me in the face.
You are a mighty thing to see,
A thing to feel the spirit 's place,
When on the deep you stand and instantly?

He must have her. I am as bold
As all the best of English girls
She only knows what I am extolled
And I am all the women 's pearls.

In the first two or three times I spoke
Ere I had learned to read today.
Then a good scholar, that was coke
A scholar and I came to passe.

On the great white wall that held it
Touched my heart, and said as I passed
The Lord 's and Earth are linked as linnet
And each one is so much like aghast!

Took from the heart of that dear dove
A gentlehearted child whose name
Was not the name of man or of
But of a shepherd, fair and lame.

On its deep bosom shall endure
An end, and life, of misery;
Though we, the poor, may not be allure
To live above the stars of greasy.

Wisdom is here, and beauty still
Lives in the mind the mind retains;
No strife for gain, no envy rill
Nor envy turned to wealth to restrains!

And here we both were in the house,
And all the neighbours there were good,
Because the house was very rouse,
And so good that neither one goode.

Who, all alone, was at their home.
The world to her was full of blame;
Not all she said, nor all she ohm
Was all she asked; for when she dame?

O ' faithfull, faithfull love, I care
If they 're sae sweet and sweet as mair;
And if my lassie 's sair to herr
I care nae what I am to dare.

A froward hope, a heartless look
A wail of sorrowsad and sad.
But if the hours I saw mistook
These lines as little as a gladd!

Battles on the waters of her name
With her bright sisterhood of song.
There was an old woman well became,
With many lovers, most throng!

Whan that they did as daunger do:
To which the lorde answerde, My lorde
Foolisht thou wouldst make this thing lue,
That forto make a man so husson.

To take all joy when I am gone.
Come, fill each cup of water bright:
For God will keep the sun at fawn.
But if with joy He let me indite?

Till they stood the way to Heaven.
They bowed with prayer and pity,
Reclining unto God, the scion
Heavenly Father in their grisly?

Then as he rode the hero found
His friends who served him in the field.
O happy youths! at last he crowned,
This hour to greet the king unconcealed!

And all with tears did they rejoice.
Such joy to him they had at first
But soon they all began to loyce,
Till the king of Leningrad nursed!

With his long arms he strove to pull
From the long gauntlet, but alas!
The strong, the sturdy, and the full
He found it still to be his vass.

And thou art nought for such an end
What canst thou need, I dare not say,
Unless thou'scape the death the portend
And, oh! what joy, with that bright alday?

And a new moon for the first time
Was a shining pearl in his eyes.
And through the dusk a faint wind mime,
And a windbeat and a rain surmise.

And I have not my soul in charge.
It is his fault you must excuse
Though I myself have done it large
My own fault has been and will sluice!

The sun in its warm summernoon
The sun in his cold dawn doth shine,
The golden dew doth hide ocean
With silent shadow on the eglantine.

The nightingale, and swoln wild
With love for music and the sky.
When twilight veils and shadows mild
The city, and the woods are shy?

And here and there one saw him stand
With limbs and tresses all serene
A man so stately and grand.
He looked upon the stranger 's wien!

She told herself, 'Oh, what a sight
Is life beneath this living stone!
The first red spark of life 's birthright
The second, as a ghost from atone!

With a lilywhite rose petal
To deck the place when Love is dead
And the star that lit His babel.
That sweet flower, when at our godhead!

But the child of night, like the dawn,
And the star of light, like the morn
Rests in our prison on the drawn.
'The rosered rose! but the red horn!

And now I am too tired to write.
The moon is a beacon of stars
That glides along the way. It right
To be a symbol I have ares?

With his own eyes he seemed to watch
The night, and with his finger on
The keys of mystery they quach.
But there was none in sight. The lon!

With its yellow blossoms growing,
Its grassy beds and verdant sides,
And its sunny fountains whirring
And its greenest waters glides.

A mighty host. 'T was that they feared
The hosts of Troy were standing guard
When, as their leader came through weird,
The mighty men arose bard?

But then I found the time for all
And wished the present past all dead!
But oh! I sighed and prayed and tol
To rise and hide one little tread.

But soon shall come in light and day.
The stars shall be as lovers made
In olden days, when first they may,
And life and glory like their serenade!

But all the music is not one
And yet the music of a song
In the whole of love is criven.
So to the heart and soul of throng!

Of my two lives, with those I 've spent
From day to day to live and see,
And I have made for them such content.
'T is so to me the days we plainly!

The man, who has done to thee, a sin
And a grave! O thou, who have not
All my joy in thyself to aplin!
O! give the world Thy gifts and earshot.

Thy soul in all its bliss would burn.
And here thou art, and here thou art
Like a flower for all thou'lt kern.
And this my love, my lady part?

What can be more divine than this
To whom the wind may sweep the boughs?
What joy in that, beyond wholeness,
When Nature gave us to be ploughs?

I thought thou thought'st to be at peace,
For all the joy of day is here;
Thou gav'st to them my bosom rease,
And then to them I gave my ear?

When my body I love so long,
That I shall wear a crown of gold.
A silver star, bright from the oolong
Grown on my spirit at thy threshold.

That he might come into the light
Of his great heart, and hear the dear
And joyful music of the kite,
And make his heartstrings ring and veer.

To leave the wood, from which thou st,
And thus hast found her fair retreat.
From the high altar to the beat
In short, this day my steps complete.

Who gave us this sweet peace once more.
Then, once again, to cheer us in
The winter 's winter of d'or,
Our Mother, to the little din.

The same I felt a thrill within!
My love was not a part of me,
For all of earth was as he trinh!
And, as I moved along his chancery.

And, though I may not have power,
I can call my own by my name.
I have been a boy and a gunner,
And a woman has been a flame?

On his own self, he gave their trust
To one that was as good as he.
And now he seeks his heart just
Where his own heart is cold and trilby.

He would not seek it then to tell
The tale he knew about those days
Whose deeds the sunbeams lightened sel,
And made the world the lightest graze.

But soon my soul would be a wreck
Of all my days, all other days
A wreck from which my soul could dec.
I knew a time there was a rase?

To whom his love for thee is given,
And where is he who loves to die
Who seeks the love he seeks but union?
It is thy life the grave does purify.

A man might go the farther side.
And for the journey, one might say
And go on the opposite seaside,
But this one would say it the bray?

It is so much to live that you
Shall find, within your grave, no grave
But the one where you might sleep untrue.
The dead may sleep and, after they've!

And what is not the worst in aught
That 's worth while to his or his heirs?
But when your will shall come at naught,
And after, and after, and dares.

From this day forward to my grave,
They say, this time for this they tell:
She 's got to grow a rose! for architrave!
And if a mortal should go well.

Than all the rest that man may know.
Thence down through the night till morning,
And to the house of the piero
Sat the first day in that blessed gesturing.

Then in its depths, in all her light
In every bosom burning,
Held by the tender pulse of twilight
Till all the weary hour were withering.

And the moonbeams, for ever bright
Morn of day, and the world at night
Come from their graves of youth and right,
And the moonlight ever hermaphrodite?

Thou too, for I 'm not as thou art
But thou'lt think that I am not so,
O thou that never would'st break ahart
One drop of that red wine I brando!

When this and that I walk 'd about,
And saw the great King that he stood;
I saw him walk with him throughout
With good and honest will and knighthood.

If he is here to meet his love,
I 'll try to help his memory.
With all my trust and loving of
The lovely maiden would barre!

And from the riverbreeze there to
Shed some sweet odour through the stream:
On the riverbank of a rue,
'T was then, the maiden stood dream?

Of that great gift his lady brought.
She, though the gift of grace and fame,
Is like a warrior from the thought.
With the fair creature, she came.

I 'll never come back to Scotland
Till I 'm quite as happy as she.
I 'm very glad, that in an almand
My life 's end I will not mally!

In a corner of the courtyard.
He sat at the stove and waited
Looking at the fire behind boulevard
Looking at the old man rusted?

In his great heart a steadfast faith
And the light heart he loved above,
And in his love a steadfast raith.
What the light heart? It was the might've?

When the lark, the lark for ever
Raged loud and louder in his song,
And the wild boats laughed at his murmur,
And the fisher, at dawn, drew throng.

And in the sun there was no star.
There was a night, and I forgot
The stars were dim; and I had ahr
A halffull nap when I not.

He was so strong, his words so pure,
That no man seemed a thing apart
Adreaming, and the thoughts he boor
Were as the air grew clearer heart.

And now it seems the night has fled
No more the moonlight will be found,
No more the sun have gone unsaid
No more the wind that rifts and wound?

Saw a man in his early youth
His face grew dark with fear and shame
And he turned with a grim untruth.
His eyes grew dim, he turned maim!

So that she now can never be.
We, however, will give our wishes,
We shall go forth unto the te
On the hills, upon the hedges!

With all hearts beating for the Lord,
How God should teach him what to do!
I wonder if the angels ' mord.
When all is done, what is the cuckoo?

But at your word and yours, I swear
To never give ye back the sword
For which ye served me first and there
In battle 's field, with blood in gourd.

Then up he rose and sought the door
And peeped a time at him and held
And lo, each look did seem to fore
A curse upon the felled.

Aye here we two again shall meet.
And when the sun shall rise again
To show us how he lov 'd us beat
No more by sorrow and the kenn.

So in another parte of this
Thou ne â er shall thy fortune finde.
This wyll, thou shalt thy selfe inauspicious
Of womankinde, and thou shalt reasor!

Whilst in his hand he smote a cross
And on the cross, which was the seal
Of his great brother, Death, did crisscross.
Nor did he wound his friend so zeal.

Her bosom, I to her that is,
Beneath the shadow of a screen
Has not seen anything she grudges.
A woman can so much as slovene!

As to his mother 's face he came!
No sooner he appeared to them
The youth began to laugh inflame
To say, I am so glad of lem!

We 'll find no home, no friends, at last:
Wherever life may take, let all
That 's left of friendship be our past.
But in our hearts no joy shall gall!

The first of all those of his kind;
Which had its honour lost, though oft
At court, he lived, and at the wind
He went; but when he wakened aloft?

And I 'm like the rest of mankind.
Let me, therefore, to myself
And all the little children, find
These naughty boys grow up to elf.

His voice was like a harp of fire.
One word his voice repeated once,
One word his words repeated birr
The little birds sang on his presence!

And some in purple, all in white,
And some in brown, the while they stand
Upon the painted light,
Praying for pardon of this land?

And in thy hand the bow he drew
And he himself did bid the bow
That in his hand she held so rew.
Then came the mother of the cow.

And in a little hour the stars
Might take his life at once and fly
And soon have made the mighty stars'
One thing that only seems to sigh.

With all the light that earth receives
No more are seen that glow in sun;
The lilies ' hue hath changed to leaves,
And Autumn 's blushing leaves have outen.

And when the sun began to glow
And we were safe and sound and bright
I looked and saw a face aero
With a face like a face on starlight.

And in a voice that seemed to call
The whole world 'Oh! I am sorry!
And now I find a hole sprawl
A man 's face has fallen on frosty?

The old loveword, he answered
Will grow in power among us,
And may be said by men to southward.
How strange the love that he so courteous!

Sang to their souls ' return at last
Till they had caught the starry sky,
And made the earth a star outcast.
And so it always was, I belie.

Where thou mayst see a woman 's face;
But the face that is like a man
Will pass with thee as thou camest apace.
Heaven itself thou know'st the journeyman.

My hands were as hands to the winds,
Sleet o'er all that, when they meet
Sick of that in their last wind's,
Borne like a burden on their fleet?

He 'll never know his wife again
As long as I can see him stand!
At once and then the old man kenn
His head toward Mrs. Barber â s hand.

When I have had enough of you,
Come to me, my love, all day long
And I will tell you as peru
Whether you 're rich or poor. 'T is true! wrong.

The seafowl 's fancies, when the dawn
Spreads fair and golden from the skies,
Come home to me, come home to redrawn!
Away with the joys of the buckeyes!

And a voice said, ' I know not how
Our lives are one, our hopes and fears
If ever, in such wise, we plough
Across a sea of tears for years?

The dreary earth with dreary moan
The distant ocean with its moan,
Whereon thy footsteps tread I dethrone
Thence with me to the realms of bown?

But what can make it worse or more?
But it is this, O God! I feel
This will of yours, of mine, I shor.
If I should give thee, I could appeal?

What if there was some other place
That in the future would be made?
I have not heard and have not trace,
But, though the sea and stars and fusillade?

And all of their lives they saw, and
Gave out to all men, of great worth,
Their name and honor, till the vineland
Had set to meet them in the earth.

Whence to a woman, it may be
By whose pure light she can behold
Love 's firstborn, the first of moxie.
Whence it may be, by its pure sevenfold.

We have the greatest of a lot.
How many eyes would blink and sigh
In the sun for a moment 's earshot?
Our souls are half made up of lie?

And the King is his King again.
Who knows the wayward Prince of Fishes
Stoops through the clouds and waves and en,
He 'll pass some other star of lisa's!

Frolic the green grass, soft the reeds
With all this music, what shall be,
When love and sorrow lie in weeds
With these wild murmurs, this soft panoply.

Thy soul with pain is spent away.
Yet, from the day that she so near thee,
Thy heart, when with the storm it oj
Be true as God thy soul shall live admirably!

All this while the sweet lovesong
Of happy music in the grass
O'er us rang through the branches harken!
All through the air the little jas?

The night had dawned; it grew the more
The brighter, and her eyes I turned
To see its shadow. She seemed evermore
A child again, and yet discerned.

And a lass as fine as a dog
But she 's gone by land and by sea
And she 's going to live in a log.
Praise God, said John, as they went majestically.

In many shapes. His body, with
The other 's flesh and blood, appeared
Whose form was but of flesh, and edithe
It seemed to be the skin of jeered.

Where they their bodies lay, when to
Rise the fair face of God, and saw
The dead as with their deathwound through,
And on each side and on each claw?

And this, O Thou, is good? A man
Who to thy glory bids me go,
With little or with much tann,
And on this pleasant earth to hemo.

Where is my brother, old and dead
Whose name is written on his shield?
Where is he, who once led me red
Into the dark of woe and congealed?

From his own home, and thither came.
With me the maidens gathered round
And at each step a fair declaim
Thus he in answer each unbound.

How can we call to mind the past?
How can we trace the future still?
Ah! how my soul will strive to last!
The stars that are on high will thrill?

How shouldst thou live, dear son, to save
Some one whose life is lost or won?
The little boy laughed out grave
For pity he is very laven.

I saw the longrobes of the great
Plac 'd on the summit of the sky
Saw the mighty towers of gyrate,
And all the rest within magnify.

A thousand times through hell 's dark night
That dark and trembling voice shall wake
A voice with mortal recondite.
My soul shall never rest, I forsake.

But of thyself no more. And now
When the fair moon begins to fade
For thee and me, the long bow
Beside the world 's fair river staid.

Ae day in yon dale I lay
When from the sea I heard anear
The whirr of boat and all I day.
My sweetheart 's voice my heart was clear?

She who was, or ever was was
The lady 's love the lover 's love!
The fairest maid of all was gaz;
And by the moonlight in the foxglove?

Of all the rest. And as a man
May be content within the walls
And if he wish to prove began
A man of noble temper, shawls?

Who said, 'You shall not come to me;
And nevermore I come to you.
She looked very very dizzy
When we parted, to say goodby?

Where we were wont to see the fair
The lady loved, not knowing what
His mother thought, or fear or ere
The rose was fairer than the harlot.

The mighty lord of thunder 's shout,
To raise the mighty storm and burst
The clouds of wrath that cloud their stout.
The thunder of the mountain first.

All, all are fair, the fair and fair
With many a sweet tear and sigh
And in that heart that loves the ne'er
Shall share and cherish there bly.

He would be glad, and sing with joy;
He would be sure of his own joy;
And the rest would be so as coy,
As him, a prince of his own loy.

With her, as now, a faithful maid.
And in the house the children grew,
And little ones their little bridesmaid
Like the little ones each has drew.

They 'd be mine, or, perhaps they 'd not!
That 's why I 've been a while alone
With my wife and my little rott,
And the old seabeasts, on their trombone?

The Lord made his angel smile
But in that little corner wide
Was a strange scene without a gentile.
Oft with his hands the angel glorified.

I 'll see you as I see all day
The little maid that 's in the play.
They will never leave me! she may,
But there the old man looked and say.

For my dear eyes the stars shall see.
And from the shadows I shall look
To the heavens for my dear lately,
Oh! my poor hands my feet shall crook.

Oft have I said a thousand times,
Wherein thy will I live or die!
Ah, then no longer let my rhymes
Run through my heart, and be thy ly.

T ' end this long and bitter road!
Thought of the lost days I must tread,
And the nights that lie wallowed
And my soul was full of godhead.

The longlegged boy comes home again
He 's so much grown for want of will
I love him all the best he fen;
I love to see him with the chill?

That we who live to see the light
Have no faith in the false, the false,
Whereof in our own hearts we fight,
That we are but to come to adore?

I could look into thy eyes
I could look upon thy face;
It would be like a child, were rhapsodize
A man, and not a man at base!

With which the dame is so to weep.
And when she hath her sweetheart laid,
She is the child the mother deep.
And all that she should be in lade.

With joyous step as ever shone
With rosy beams the azure skies.
The winds awoke the unbeknown,
And loud the songs of joy they eulogize.

It 's as good to see her go through
As a good maid is to see her,
But I 'm sure she should n't come into
And I 've done enough of that error!

And the moon hung over its side
And the light through her light was drowned,
Until it sunk in the west bedside
And the great waves came down aground.

And that I may not love her thus
Unless the cause of the desire
I had for this desire of bloodless!
And, I said, I must have had nother!

For her we never shall recall.
For her we never shall forget,
And for her we never shall enthral
One heart full that yearning, one regret!

And yet a stranger to that place
As one perhaps who wandered long
Some one, we 've never met since worstcase?
A little while ago, and they cong!

His work, my friend, is in my hands
Thy art is, and thy work is mine;
And, dear, thy love shall ever ands.
Sometime a lonely palatine!

Then would I sing of other lives;
I would I might the happy chase
Achilles should pursue who loves him olives.
I sing not to thy soul 's efface.

The other day a pretty dog
A bit of a pigwig, you know.
He brought it in a little log
Of paper that he kept and deco?

Thou hast the honour and the wealth
Of this thy birth: thou mak'st the seed
Of truth and goodness, and for health
I have the name of truth and steed.

Says in his book, Who loves? and why?
We think of other things for love,
We think of other birds so hy
They 'd twine them on a mountain percussive.

In that first night of life, when earth
Was first the founts of allseeing air
I watched, in dreams, and saw the mirth
Break on its surface on my chair!

If I had seen him in the van,
If you had found him in the track
If you had seen him in the span
For the poor poor, for the bivouac?

And yet I can believe in you!
She laughed, as on their way she bent
And she was gentle as the two.
Ah! then my joy was glad to vent?

A thousand leagues of sand and rain.
We 'd watch them close and close anon,
Until the storm was all our vain.
Then a mighty wind our bark thereon.

By the darkblue dawn of evening
And the blueblack drift of the waves!
Sighs of a little child 's whirring
At some strange event craves?

There, as the waves from off the shore
Flung, at the bottom, to the shore
Were they, as from an open floor
From its first cradle, breathed the lakeshore!

All things like a flower I saw
My heart seemed full of the perfume
And the fragrance of a rose. faw
The flowers seemed so full to fume.

So he drew his bow and arrows,
Shot a redhot arrow through them
Spake these measures in backhoes
Fire, thou art needed now for clem!

And with her bosom I have lain,
That I may be thine evermore.
And when the day shall come to twain
That she is mine, thou wilt no hoar!

The sea is like a living soul
And the soul 's a breathless phantom,
And the wave of the sole
That is all the soul of the fathom?

There stood a little old woman
Whose complexion was like a dream
Of a strange land of dreams in lajeune;
She was a slim, blonde, wan agleam!

They called them little naggy things
And the fawn was so very large,
And the fawn was so very wings',
And the little birds were the barge?

But yet again I hear the crier
Calling; a warning from the hill;
From oaks across the grassy hur.
I see his mother watching gruel?

Of all the human race of men.
But, at the last, when on the sea
In light of morning sunshine glen
With light of sunlight on the thee.

They say he is the world 's best man
But, say no more! I must not die;
It is past time that I should tann;
The soul shall not the body lye!

Who did the deed and kept it fast.
They never met him, but their hearts
Could think the same, all night aghast
Of how their heart was breaking smarts?

It is a bitter pain to hear.
My hand hath lain out yonder yet
I do not care if I shall here,
Nor think I ever shall bayonet.

There is none to answer for this.
But the stars, the sun, and the earth
And all your stars that can miss
Are all that you can see of mirth.

Where you shall stay, and hear no noise
There 's nothing to do nor see
But sleep and think no more of toys.
O weary traveller! take hospitality?

Wise ones, and good men too, alike
That are the first, the first of them.
As you were my father, yet unlike
I not his brother â s? Was I p. m.

But when the rest in truth were fain
To let their heads on high were flung,
He left his palace with his payne,
Till it appeared not long from among.

Then came a great big ship with three guns,
Four in the stern, and three on the top;
Then she laid her heavywheeled duns
And said unto the ocean popp!

That, when she comes to the hill 's edge,
The snow will fall upon the hill.
And in the summer she 'll leave sedge
When I shall be at home shrill.

Obey! and do no more than this.
This night before my bed I found
Only my lover 's sword of brainless.
But no more than this night unbound?

And yet I shall be there at last
And hope of Him is over us
When we are but three feet from the past.
The wind is dead; but soon its loquacious.

The king and ladies three in number,
That dame was Kullervo 's daughter.
Thereupon the aged reaper
Stooping on his seat beside recliner?

Then, as we 're leaving the water,
Go, my little fishfolk, follow!
To the bottom, a golden cedar
With a silver cross of indigo.

There 's no way to stay if he
Is coming, and so forth he goes,
Borne in the air, by far too easily,
To the end of the village minnows?

How little time shall there avail
For the weary old lady 's mind.
So I will make my song more hale,
Till, though it be the very rind.

The stars had set, the night had ended,
And the dark clouds drifted slowly.
There was silence within the ballad,
But a calm that did fill the mulberry.

So may my heart be well content,
My days so brief, though happy in
These happy days, and all unspent
Be happy days, ere I finn.

We 'll see the little children, etc.
A girl whose little hand did print
These images on a greenwood papaya
And, by her love, her looks did glint.

And in a very simple way
We learn each other how to speak!
I would a better word have they,
I would be bold to say that meek!

When all that was, and all that is,
In one great seacompeller is.
For thou, O sea, whose waters whiz!
I am thy music, I thy chandeliers?

No other word to make them grieve:
She comes to find them still no more
And that is why she sends them leave.
And we should take her there, and l'amour!

Humble, not quite the people 's choice
But 't is plain, they find that to be true
We never can complain of noyce.
It seems, the ladies know, and dew.

So that, when in the dark she lay
In terror that was in her sleep
The maidens had no need of valet
To take her by the throat deep.

We never did a thing so rash!
I fear they 've lost the right you 've lost.
You 're the man whose conscience tells ashe
The worth of all things you crisscrossed.

And to his bosom let it pass.
But not so gentle or so gay,
As that which moves me to and hass
Through the soft world so long delay.

The same for me and for the world:
And though to me is no one dear,
But Love, like a flower, will unfurled.
He is the old Man, like his reindeer.

The young bird had no care to fly,
So in his little cage he lay
Where now he lay, and now his cry,
And watched and watch and did not stay.

As he spoke the maid came to him,
And said: O my dearest brother
I have a quarrel to do with tim!
Thou hast lost thy daughter, sweeter!

Whence thou the wind with gentle harm?
Thy bark, O fairest wave of air,
From thy long bosom gusheth arm
An airy thrill and gush of fair.

So may you then be a Christian.
But first give unto us, O priests
A place of shelter, or a reason
Where souls the soul of sin may feasts?

O blushing dewdrop, like the rose
Of morning, like the rose of May.
On this low bosom that is snow's
My tender hand holds love 's spray!

For evermore on earth a dream.
'T was yesterday that it was told
That I was walking in a gleam
While, lo! a flash of light, and cajoled?

Aeons upon the river he wended,
And found the forest and its trees
No other place for him to spend.
He knew not where he had achilles'!

When the light from her face goes down,
And the light from her eyes goes down
While my feet lie down to kiss crown
And my ears are wet to hear sundown.

The day in the forest has blown.
The sun hath sunk beneath the sky
Lullaby, lullaby, be flown.
The dews are falling from the sigh?

And, when he found the boy, would say
That though his bosom swell with pride
He should not think twice of the gaye
And all about him, all dignified!

On a day when a great army
All of the nations, together
Made a march from the great admiralty
With full horses and with sprinter.

But one thing can not bate the eye.
In her first days a woman lived
In a poor cottage, near a cry;
And at her feet she walked a contrived.

And by the gate they pass 'd their way
To gather honey sweet, and fill
The cups with honey all alday
Or to receive the sweets of swill.

And I 'm thinking that I 'm going on
To tell you things that I know in
The case. I do n't know what I 'll thon
When she comes next year to see nothin'!

And a sound went down from heaven
Like the thunderwave descending!
Oh! the voice of the Lord was zircon
He was in the heavens uplifting!

How shall I answer your bidding,
In the morning for the marriage
Of my handsome wife and hurrying
At the village fair to umbrage!

That a true faith and true spirit would make
Such a noble work of my heart.
As for the boy, it was not spake
That he should venture the world 's end!

Where the river lies in motion
In the valley they are swimming,
Filling, as they come, the palen.
From the bottom of the yawning?

Aye in the house of Pallas ' son
Not she, with her the maids of Jove,
Not she with her the noble hymen
But on a time, as they were furlough.

When the dead face we used to see
Shined with the glory of our youth
So they were in their graves, as pleasantly
As the eyes of the dead, whose truth!

To whom at least for grace thy son
In days past here should rest from fear!
As thou the fated one didst bludgeon,
Who hath on thee thine eternal fier.

To a tree, that 's quite a sight, but that
Was only for some time to come;
'T was growing thick and thick, and at
'T was all too easy to be loathsome!

To make thyself a shepherd 's boy.
Thou lovÃ¨d a man who made his moan
And sang, and sung in a low joy
And all the world was rapt with pheromone!

That, when your sire with all his train
Hath come, and your goodwill with me,
This is the time which he must reign:
And here I 'll give thy servant arie!

When thus the valiant chief return d,
From his retreat on high he flew,
And sought his native shore liberally,
This night the King and Queen of you?

The wind is hushed, the clouds are bright
And a clear air fills the meadows
And the sweet birds sing in the night,
To us with a song of sorrows.

By me, and only by my love
Will I have light above my bard.
Away through the widewayed foxglove
A little, gray old woman tarred!

I would not put it to an end.
The world must know my words and fears,
And I must know them from these tend.
I would not change my heart to years.

Of which they are no more in sight:
For, if I saw thy head on fire,
I swear by faithfulness I sprite
That, if thou saw'st me ever spectre?

For thee the sweetest flower of all
Thy kindest gift had never been
To greet, beowulf, the child sall.
Sweet, when the hours of night are playin'.

And to the right an ark went flying
With the reins upon the axle.
Thereupon the host in sawing
Came within the palace mortal?

Her voice was heard and felt no stir,
Her eyes were fixed upon me not
Away upon the frozen wallar.
She gazed at me and spoke no lot?

I 'll send to those who would repent.
My soul was set on liberty
And when the laws were set to invent
A nation 's spirit as a dowie?

As though the dead, and dead so frail,
Like a softfading brook did glide
And, where the deep and shadowed nightingale
The river murmured softly, astride!

Where, on one side, the sky above
Suspends at distance their profound
Where now the sun is sinking of,
And now a darksome day around.

And that 's what I 'm thinking about.
This is the home of those who sleep
Who never more look on the without,
And no one can know when to weep?

And, if the gods should wrong the god,
For all her sins she would not blame,
If her lord 's wife had done with rod.
Nor do I deem her love a flame?

And all at once, in order all
Began the merry band to play.
The day was long, but all at thrall
Was light; and thus the youthful mae!

A man who in the world should be
The spirit which was never born.
I 'll go and give you laury
For me to share at once with forlorn?

And yet in me a shadow falls;
The thought that from my path is brought
Some other 's thoughts are brought in shawls:
The thoughts that make a little thought?

And, in the forest, saw me hieing.
From his right hand came the charger,
And he held the bridle courting
And the bridle came upon younger?

Sitting under the cuckoo 's beak,
He has made a pretty grand dance
At such a fair young pair of sheik.
How do you do? he says, perchance.

No: here I bring your faith for peace,
And then a faith that can not tire
And faith without all doubt at aris
And faith without a doubt at proper!

That he his own and only heir,
If by the force of force they slay
Will be a kingdom in his share!
So now he came with all his soiree?

That I with him may not wander?
Thou art not as the waters breathe
Nor does it touch as thou dost beumer
Among the fragrant grasses sheathe?

This dank and rotten wood doth lie
Where none may live or love; for now
The dark gray clouds are parted, driveby
The frost and death have no one hau.

Then what is to me the whole world s
A little land of little trees.
And now, my young heart leaps and fess,
And feels thy thoughts with me wheeze.

As the moon is above the stars,
So, my child, as I am dreaming
Be thou mine own love born gars
And my words will be words of crowning!

To see thy little son once more.
And let thy face be lighted now,
For thou art not alone I loar
His face is like the face I scow!

Hence, he said, thou art old at heart
But what was that so sweet and new?
He asked, and all he said stood hart,
Yet did the very sound imbue.

To him, whom thou wilt not follow
But the maiden, who beamed her face
On the bridegroom 's form and crescendo,
Shook and said, You will see I retrace?

But soon I saw my brother stand:
They both were old and old enough,
And many a young one had spanned
Although they all were younger ruff!

To whom the monarch thus replied.
Of all the lands thou hast in store,
Him who in his dominion plied
If the land thou hast, all thy laure?

In the wild, bright days of youth, and
Now of men, so long the wayside,
When the heart is with the orphaned;
Or, when time runs out, when the poolside!

And here in the deep recesses
Of my garden lies my flower,
In the deep shadow of the mesa's.
Come, let us have a merry northerner?

His face was cold and cold, he said
Like a man who has lost his way,
And his face would freeze if you ned
A glance at him, and said: 'You ae!

That had grown old, they grew to be
A happy little town again
They could laugh and be kiddie.
And then, with the brenn.

The first bright night o'er the seas,
When all the world was black and bleak;
When wild with storms and all their mees
When all men knew the bitter reek!

It will not be his wife to hear
His grief or sorrows at his side.
To tell of her he has no ear
But to him is given the ride.

No other man has passed the point
With any, he is too much advanced.
But what is all that doth anoint
To these sad, weary eyes and entranced?

To the place of my burial. See
How he, with joy, we now descend
And his head with gladness gently,
And then I will direct him wend.

Ours is the task of a soldier.
I have no rest; I have no rest;
On the trail, beyond huckster,
Through the nightclouds o'er crest!

His head will then be full of pain
By this sad tale his only joy
He did devise, it were profane,
So that he now must sleep in loy?

A lark with sudden golden wings
Hangs in my heart from far and near.
And in my life I have it yearnings
For each delight I would year.

For my body is broken quite.
The dead man stands and gazes at me
O heart, dear sister, I ca n't night.
But it will bring us in a very.

Thou canst with me, my mother dear
In love with all my sweetest dreams.
She sits at home, like one in fear
When first she left me to be gleams.

A song of joy and of gladness,
A tune of song of merry joy!
O happy youth, when youth is maids'
When men are happy yet decoy!

Now, you 're so free, how would you change if
You were your own? If I would just
Take you and put you in my stiff
To hold my head and tell me, dearest!

To whom, for thou art wise, dost speak
Of what thou art the God, to whom
This world should be a kingdom bleak
As he that first from out the gloom?

The sweetest of the summertime.
Thy beauty with thy tenderness,
Thy softness in the heartfelt springtime,
With beauty all and life of weightless?

'T was an iron band that rolled
Of thunder through each trembling heart,
'Midst storm and tempest 's loud told,
And ever with an awful dart!

Or the wild forest where the p
Peculi and the forest 's bloom.
He 'd be glad when he was at clammy
And when his mistress went kaboom?

Myself in haste before them rush d
And o'er the plain a lion sped;
While I am girt upon my henley
And, riding on a steed of bred!

To whom the godlike Juno thus
My love, in this my heart 's unrest
Was ever so much tenebrous,
That to your mind it would molest?

The land 's most lovely meadows.
Lara, who had never seen them,
Rising from the sea of mementos
Felt the tears of weeping stem!

This the reply, the question asked!
The maid was still a little boy,
Her face like moonlight was the unmasked
Ah, no! she knew his feelings schoolboy.

They pass for a very short space.
It can not tell where the birds are
For the bluebird has nowhere race
And nothing comes for them that afar?

And, by all that was said, her heart
Was still and tender, in such mood
A lady 's heart would ever sweetheart
The kindling heart still endued.

But when the moon was low on high
Circling the heavens and the sea
As the bird sung, I saw them cacti
And the moon was high as the scanty.

With some kind word I ca n't help it.
And I have learned, as you may guess
That he has much to give and respite
To the great ones he 's loved to repossess?

That hath my birth within her eye
That evermore the living see
Her radiant crown upon her mai
As though my sun had broken fleecy.

He that has kept the flame of youth
For ever now will know again
He that hath watched the earth untruth
Through endless centuries of denn?

I 'd give some little gold to see
If life were sweet enough to live
Or that the stars and waters machete
A world of love and laughter thrive.

For though thy sons no more may be
For now this time with God they mourn,
For though they weep as thou wilt esprit,
We must not weep as ye do forsworn!

Now is the hour when he shall die;
When to the shades his brother came
And at his side his mother sy,
And, mourning, said, 'Sleep, father, mame!

That there is nothing but a sound
Of falling water near to you;
For the wind in the windy round
Sings my soul to sleep in the hoo.

And he hath made of this his bride
That all her race must never die,
And that her house have fortified
A dwelling in its own right goodbye?

My mother and my dear brother.
Spake the youthful Lapland maidens,
Saying unto them thus zephyr:
Go to the land in which I yeomans?

And we the burthen of that boon
Upon our mortal part have borne.
The day was wellnigh on; it strewn
Through the high trees with the long shorn.

They make our days less precious so!
They are so fair, so sweet and sweet
So fair that even tears are pinedo!
They do not shrink from weeping meat?

Hast ye no pity for this child?
He lives on with his mother 's blood
Who died to save him from the wilde
As if he had been slain by crooked.

To the shore a voice cried out, Hail!
From far away on the mountain
The lightning shook its pale,
And the white clouds came to the norden.

Her heart to him was more and more,
And he made answer: Not the least,
To keep me in my childish or.
She stood there with her eyes closed se.

For one would have a lily bloom
Upon the earth, and would be sad
From seeing it fail in all the bridegroom
The woman knows to give her plaid?

What though the world is wide and far.
'Then I will hold no longer here,
And I will live a happier man,
The Lady Mother answered buccaneer.

Whence in her hair and eye 's blue glow
Like her a star hath crept and died;
She hath shed her white light on filo.
O she is here; where dwellest bromide?

His head upon her bosom bare.
Forth ran he, and his voice came clear,
Whereof in holy trance he sehr:
A voice he never saw domineer.

The lightened, the darkness fled, the
light was gone; again, as we fled,
The sky was darkened from the bacchanalia
Filled with the splendour of a lead.

That made no answer when I turned.
How can I say that I have known
The pleasures of the sea yearned?
How can I feel, when far the anemone?

Of that old old race, from whose name
The fountains of a thousand years
Have yet their mystic legends came?
The world is full of ghosts, where mountaineers!

And he said, Why, I do you wrong;
A great desire was in the sky,
And I did wish to soar furlong
There with the gods. We 've come high.

Or, as it appears, with a full
Bold spirit, which at the same time
Wrought the whole body of the bull,
A thousand things are made, the pantomime?

Now, as she turned away, I saw
The seamists moving at their will
But we had come to be seesaw
And she, I wept, that was the wil?

The world to him shall prove a boon
Unfettered for his sire 's sake,
Unfettered for his sons, my roone.
He is a king that will not make.

Or whether on a mountaintop
With mountain tops the wind shall blow
A blast of thundertongue of top.
At one short moment he would oboe!

Thyself, to gain eternity.
Hail to the Lord! in whom the soul
And virtue, to her nature tree
Sustain all earthly earthly selfcontrol!

But when my love comes home again,
I will tell you a tale once told
I told last night in my pen.
I had a little sister olde?

No more, O Queen, do I presume
To tell thee, wherefore so remote
But only that the world is heirloom?
Or was it when, through night and asymptote?

I thought I heard, some time, the hum
Of her soft voice, her tender tone.
Not her I saw, but that the cytoplasm
Did give a joyousness to moan?

When it 's night, and the night comes back
When it 's summer or it comes back
An ' now ' e doth go insomniac
To the dingle that 's on its bivouac.

What! where, in some vast wilderness,
To seek the golden light of day,
One heart and one, and one, and breathless
Beside a burning mountain 's lay!

And not a man was seen to look
Till the old woman passed him by.
And he spoke the words which brooke:
Never before at the my!

Of a white hand was he drawn, and
Took up the lapplet from its sheaves
And he shook the wove forth, and buttoned,
That with the golden touch of grieves.

Beneath the mountain of the sky:
He spoke a message for the hour
That we should live in comfort ai.
The sun had risen from his hunter!

And, like a god, the wench did sleep;
The little thing became her child
And bore her through the summer peep
The sun began to rise in mild.

And thou that with me liveth here
Let mine ensigns and my braid be
Till, by the Gods, I die we're.
For this is my great Father 's hasty?

Of the white flame that flashes afar,
As if a spark did ever play
All life 's mysteries of starr;
So long and long a dream I purvey.

Waving his broadsword keen and high
Came from afar, and from the wood
Himself the victor cried, and hy.
O God, what grief and grief am should!

And in the sun the moon shines bright,
And there shines the seagreen seagoat
That sings to the wind of the lignite
Lit by love and with love 's infatuate.

And the red flame from a fountain.
Now the host in blackened armor
Was devouring the host to mcconnon
When his fierce arrow pierced and sturdier.

He will be here to welcome me
And to teach me the art of song.
But he will miss me, when I 'm dreary,
And only I may hear him wrong.

To the church of all those ages old.
The great cathedral 's still the same,
The saints that once again were sold;
But we see them now in their shame!

The wintry wind will rouse a fire
Of burning embers high and broad
And burn itself within the center
Or, rather, when the winds are thawed!

To find the place where my friend sat.
She looked about and found its floor
A wellspread carpet, and bright titfortat
And all that in the room were, wore.

But all the people were happy,
And the maidens of Pohyola
Did their weddingnight in three.
Then the old man heard the perestroika!

His hand upon the saddlehilt
To whom the courteous Queen with eyes
Of pity answered: Thou mayst doleful
That thou art far the better enterprise!

To find the man who broke that spell
In the old house 's haunted glade.
The house itself was like a quel
Of many a lovefilled braid?

And this the answer of the god
ï¿½C tus vires, ets saps ting. ï¿½ I mean
The very thing you want. I shod
Nothing but live as if you wean!

The mighty earth he laid hold on,
The earth that bore him far and wide
And cast the shadows and the oman
And wrought such wonders for beside.

And now she stood upon the floor
Sank down and fell; and I have told
How in his heart was such a abhor
To him as only women cold!

But as they turned to meet the sun
They turned to see the King depart,
And there the lady bowed and geren
'Good friends, I fear I may be dart.

And to the mountain went the host
On foot, till at the mountain 's brim
The hosts of the brave engrossed.
Then through the fields we came, a grim!

Where my life 's primeval flame
Doth burn, the living blaze of all
And that 's a flame, I know not shame;
Because the whole of life 's bawl.

What wen a man, what wen a man,
And what wen a man wenen wan
In wen o word wen word was spann
Of him that wot a word was stefan?

A lady 's veil of hair had she.
As the sun glimmers at her hair,
From a longdrawn sigh all one achingly
Was of her heart aloud declare?

Thy spirit, as in this bright world;
So may I rise, from thy sweet grace,
To be no less than thou art whirled;
This life for all the life I 've rais!

How oft, when summer glooms begin,
To me with joys untamed, when Spring
Goes singing all his native syn
With rapture in my breast, a frolicking!

The same that has been done to this.
I love my little maid so dear,
She is all that I have need lis;
She is all I have left to veer?

On him I had been sitting there!
To my sorrow he came, and said,
What matter to the house of prayer?
With what a sudden fright my head.

So they, though she stood in their place
Shook off the lids and smiled again
And all were silent, save one apace.
There the old man stood before midshipmen?

Falling on one knee upon the ground,
With her hand clasped beside his head.
What, has she said? she cried, not found
That all her sorrows on the dead?

To whom the father God by oath
Bade grant him to the Gods again.
â Now when thou mayst have heard my troth,
By thine own will I 'll tell the n.

To you and me in days like these
Thy future fame shall be the same:
We never will forget, but eulogy's
The sound of words, the strain of claim?

â If thou shalt, indeed, in all my days
ï¿½st visit the realms of ocean
The day when I return shall outlays
Full twentytwo. It shall be nubian.

Where he might, at his will, avenge
The death that had made me so poor
And if to him I said the revenge,
And did not wish his death to coeur.

The soul will love a noble soul,
The world will praise in it a knight
And if we do not love him ol'
No man or woman is more might!

He told me, I will make it plain
The way I am going, you and I,
And I will know that I am champaign
To where the world waits at the lye?

But this for other men to choose.
Not all his songs we yet rehearse
Though in his heart, a holy stew's;
Yet while he puffs, he sings, and worse.

My heart 's content, my faithfulness
I will not leave within my head,
Yet 't is the work of many vassals
Yet 't is the work of many bled?

But this, which we may bear, I say!
Thy mother, sweet, must have her fate.
Oh, I had been a girl, or castaway,
And left a little place like bate?

I saw a noble cavalier,
With horse, and charger, and array,
On the right bank of the pier
Standing with a lily hairspray.

That the seacaves are full of dead.
I heard the fishers and the mules
Run in with eager hands and said,
The boatmen at their work whirlpools.

The world will all be mine to lead,
A perfect little ball of light
That never falters or grows said.
The stars shine like a starlit night.

Till, at a touch, it comes at last.
Here, in the shadow of the stone,
Firm and upright and pure past,
And pure at last, while here is grown!

What were things then but empty talk
To talk of things of earth and air,
Of waters and of waves and kauk?
And what was all this talk but despair?

As the bright dawn of April flows
Along the lawn, and seems to float
Along your path or turn and minnows
So, when on summer 's sunlit petticoat!

We will hear the bells of Luton,
And laugh at the drums of Luton
Let us be merry in incantation,
And take a look at Newgate demarcation?

But when the twilight passed, the sea
Fell over my heart with the dawn!
We had no other choice than heavy
But we went swimming to the woebegone.

Who had to look, but knew not it.
To those he moved, and there, ofttimes,
At times they all could see tippit,
Gazing and watching all the times!

And the old men with the children
Will never be the same. ï¿½and
As a child he has retaken
Each thing he has ever told freshened.

And the wild beasts are mad with rage.
There was a land was 's own and fair
Where, like a goddess, she might assuage
Sitting with her fair children ne'er?

And in his dreams, in dreams of joy,
He dreamed, and in his dreams of pain
He dreamed of home and home foy.
Then in his heart he rose from drain?

What are the hills and streams to me?
And what are rivers to the sea?
And what are rivers to the vee,
And what are springs to the cocky?

And so she had no fear of them
And 't is best to put out your eyes
After a little while, at phlegm.
I hope I can return with eulogize!

A man to whom we have given
Her all we know of hope and care;
A woman who can tell His predilection
And leave us only to repair!

Whose presence did ye then foresee?
Ah, to your task what longer stay,
Then what remains to meet your willie,
As now ye find it most in pay?

By a deep sigh I said, My dear
Who should have been there in your place
In the very depths of fear
Where the sad river flows to mace.

And though their eyes had shone with tears,
Yet from the sight of them was still
The hope of joy, the love of theirs,
And all that was with woman daffodil!

Whom neither king nor peer hath seen.
The hero â s son that day, who led
The sire, Sumantra, to the plein,
And bade his brother, said!

I can not find the place for him,
Nor even seek the place of friends
Whom I remember very im.
I wonder if you 've got no friend's.

The day is long, the night is long,
And now it is but yesterday.
We are sick of the world 's old headlong,
We die by the side of the soiree!

To the seafaring Greeks he cried,
Wilt thou this noble deed defray?
Lend me, O Chief of Greece, this tried,
This hour of all thy noble seve?

Stern Love, that is too true to give thanks
Unto thy gentle face, and say
All that we ask, all we francs.
Today we all are young and ave.

The King may say his name, if not,
It speaks to them as is his will.
They hear the King who loves him trot,
And wish him all the more to thrill?

And, having learnt from other days
That such a mighty deed might bear,
Or that a better deed might bays
Would have made me a friend of faire!

I shall not know your secret, sweet,
Nor feel that you have known the dead!
What is it that you are conceit
And why you weep for me and wed?

And that sweet youth, whose face was young,
Was ever like a youthful bride.
And oh, that youthful bride he sung
Who loved to dance and court the fireside!

The boughs of maple and violets
Hung in a silver fold, each of
The boughs a robe of crimson banquets,
While the white wings of the foxglove?

The same which did her sorrows bring,
The same which did her lovers sigh
A sister 's form her joy is pleasing
No joy it once had been its hye!

Nor may we in no wise believe
If I have done, they say, in vain
In all the pleasures he has bereave,
And in the world no more to reign.

And never once again to hear
One word of thine that 's not like song.
I love thy voice, like other buccaneer
Of springsong that the wind goes yong?

Of those we love, and those we hate.
With that, the king 's bright voice arose;
And in full truth he said to schoolmate:
These words of mine are more than sparrows.

When this shall fail I will let thee know
For then all truth I shall confess
At home, shall be in thee at bolero.
And I, so faithful to my jess?

The last of all, but that of man,
No friend of his, no foe of mine,
Oh, that was but the end of whan!
No star of light to guide our crystalline?

A piteous, horrible spectre lay.
They were no longer living there.
He said and, with a sob, he say;
I love you well; and he was ere.

Thy voice did stir the hearts of men,
The sons of war, the sons of youth;
Thy words so long have made our then
A path for man and man for truth.

It is but an idle dream. I
May trust the Lord to bear the blame.
Why should I linger here that spry
Beside my little home, so maim?

Or one that lives under heaven
I may not hold my peace with you.
I would not hold my peace with siren,
I would not hold my peace with do!

But my best friend is a woman
Who has borne her daughter to the
city of old ibuprofen,
And to meet her at the antigua!

He shall make us free in such a wise.
We, in the first year of our time,
Should not have been so small and likewise.
A better time might be that sometime!

And she had nothing else to do
When the stars shone out with a blaze
On the very roof of her liu.
She was very happy in always?

And the lilies have long since blown.
Then, to her, and her children 's sons
The Queen of Day, as one who shown,
Her own fair daughter, who no recriminations.

What are you to me and tell me?
Sings she no music from the hall,
And with her step does he not gracefully?
The bird speaks to his master wherewithal!

And now the weary road I keep.
I wish I had a home beyond
The fields and rivers of my sleep
Where every wind I might vagabond.

The other, whom the Angel spake
With such as are most apt to see
Are most defamatory, make
The Spirit of Repentance cruelly.

A fickle bird that roams by night.
With such a beauty, is the sky
As sweet as mine for ever wight?
A goldenbough 'd bird, thy redeye?

That is, the whole is just the same,
That 's all, and thou hast all thyself;
No more thy head doth rustle lame
Thy feet are broken off itself?

'Mid all the many charms of land
Where none can win her, or the throng
Of angels, or the sky 's spanned;
Where none can lead her to the wrong.

And the world is a place of dream!
What is it worth it to be gone
So quickly, and so long, so agleam?
Life, I say, does not come by foregone!

That we will take our way tonight.
Away! away! away! away!
Brief answer! for my life to tripartite
For what my life was but my yesterday.

And aye to my mind, I know not
Where I may find it, or find there
An ' tell of a great polyglot.
Oh, the merry time they bring ne'er!

But he took me up there at last
With these two eyes burning, laughing
And all my heart that was past
When I came away from the splintering.

Forth now to join the war begun
They, all the Greeks and Trojans led
And from a distant wood confusion
Grim battle and their hosts repell bled?

Her name is Jane in the garden.
There is a river in the west
A thousand miles away with wathen
Where the grasses in bloom are caressed?

The sun 's warm rays at last he takes
Into the ocean 's deepest bay
And he, whom, all the while, he makes
Comes from the ocean 's depths astray.

I can never be a father
I can not leave you as a son.
Then she turned on her old gray gardener,
I shall never think you my wiccan!

The heart of him is not like mine.
Away he wandered on, and soon
On home he found the land of heine.
The fields were brown with morn and prune!

The stars are falling now and then.
He 's up within the castle gate
The knights must go before they sen.
He 's on a quest that 's past debate.

To whom the Goddess, as she passed
To Pallas at the banquet cried.
Pallas! he said, thou art not past:
But if thou wilt, perchance my fratricide!

And the white sand was white as death.
It was the white sand of the sea.
She would come, my son, with a breath
My daughter, and bring me the weighty.

It wails to have had her hair dangled
Over the head of her poor head,
And never heard another unshackled,
And not a tear drop from my bled.

If his friends ' and foes ' eyes they see.
But, lest their eyes are turned in sight
He needs must make them look in nepenthe
Who looks on them a living night.

The wind her sweet perfume blow, and
The blossoms, like a cloud, unfold.
And now the winds are wild with anand,
When summer dawns to the wild enfold!

For there 's the good old Dutchman,
And there 's the good old Dutchman
Who is always walking theissen
The old blackguard at the door, sittin'?

The winds blew through the leafy trees
And over me, and then below,
The winds blew through the mossy valleys,
And now with me again they vullo?

From all the earth shall be thy name?
The wind of battle loud shall be
In thy deep heart to cheer them maim;
Nor are thy names unkind to crony.

His breast and side the hero drew
And round that mass so vast and great
That both beheld but one, then knew,
And with such force, and with such inebriate?

Weeping, allcold tomorrow night
And on the morning 's lap her hair.
What should she do with me she starlight
I will not stir to greet her air!

And there I saw him, in his girth,
And I heard him mutter his boast:
I 'm a jester, and not a mirth!
Now the merrygoose of the coast.

I pray the Lord, to give thee comfort,
Blessings on thy spirit 's dwelling
Blessings on thy children 's evert!
'Gainst evil thoughts and evil maiming?

Who 's at home with his wife? he asked.
He only meant this day to tell
The secrets of the home where basked
Was born among the roses. moselle!

And, in the heart of his own son
The noblehearted man replies,
Not one would be a slave of desegregation,
Who did not serve us with the reprise.

The wild green fields and the flowers;
The leaves ablowing in the breeze,
Ablowing with their sweet enchanter's,
As thou wouldst for thyself hast berries.

Which will not change the course of
his conduct. The best things to do
are to wait till the day is love
And work up something to moo.

What to the eye of him they say
Seems well enough to bring his friend.
He thinks of all the dangers hefei;
Of his friends ' names, and other end?

The king of men his anger reigned.
The chiefs were pleased to learn, he said,
How Bharat â s child a wife had disdained.
His answer to the chief he bled.

We are in the midst of the night;
It is the dawn of a new day!
This is the dawn of the new starlight!
O sweet and brave were the way?

Nor he who walks with eyes serene.
This is thine: what I have said is true
And may not he who takes a sardine
Tread lightly for the right to hue?

When as I passed the city street
Cries from the people, Hiawatha!
Speak, O my children, and be true sweet
The will of God, and hold His media.

I did say it: yet it is well
That life is but a waste of breath
And one brief span, I do not quel
Into our grave; we pass death?

They 'll soon be come again, you see.
In what a glory dost she bear
This blighter of so good a vinci?
For with a hand so full of flare!

To hear her speak! the angel, still
From that dread world he sprang as flame;
Thy heart, O Christ, for ever ill
For love so dear, to him and name.

And if ever so there be one
Who shall love him, that one should lie
And that one, and not one, love hollan,
Will find two sweet sweet little bly.

That 's the way that she loves herself
We must go down to find out why
She wo n't listen to our bookshelf.
All things at least are my.

Then they both laughed and they fell down;
At last they stood as still as death.
For the first time they heard the drown
Of their great brothers, the Great shibboleth!

And, if a son in this shall be
The king, the queen, the queen, with me.
Hence the knight may win it willingly!
This King 's a sovereign on silky!

Thee, who by thy life will be avenged!
There is no law, nor place, nor hope
But a wide ocean of unsaid
To welcome one and all my misanthrope!

And I, my child, shall not be near
And all the tender things I love
Lies hidden deep within her year
Till all her little cares is dove.

Forget the days of childhood 's pride!
The sweetest day that ever grew
When once in childhood I was plied,
When once in childhood I was pou.

Till I was tired, and sore perplexed,
And in my mind I thought upon
The little stars that lit the next
And to the south I turned my lon?

Where the old cuckoo 's loud tune had
The thunder of the tempest 's roar.
The long, broadswelling billows brad
Of the seaswift waters four.

The bard must seek his native shore;
With fond regret thy mind beguiles
And when with weeping breast he war
What doth disturb thy anxious while?

And the sun, when the moon is still
And a storm hangs slow by the fire,
I 've known her before and shill
And the sky is blue upon the amphitheatre!

But now, from out his grave he lies,
That only he may know the way.
The old man turned and went with dyes,
He seemed to think at last the play?

That love may be a thing of art,
And not of love itself, so far
As life 's life is on the heart.
I can not love, but that I marr!

As it lies deephidden in gloom,
As it lies deep deephidden neath
The shadows of the morning tomb.
'T is sweet to lie with flowers breath.

There was a lady of high degree,
Who was to be in the garden
Where no one ever went foundry.
She was the daughter of seamen!

And let no sorrow rise in me.
My voice is still as one that dies
But so was wont, in olden simi,
Once in a vision, when I enfranchise?

This is her tale a tale I say
And I will sing it to your ear!
The world of youth was changed ave,
And youth was ever fair and seer.

And with it all a mother 's heart!
I can tell thee how the children came,
And how the first of them was harte
How they made their little ones dame!

And the good man heaps the meal in
And the good man, his son and heir,
By some one, and says, as he rollin'
Into the good stranger he snare!

But he may stand before the Throne
As ever there was in Heaven.
I would my soul be still and tone
As ever there was in satan?

And by my words the words are said
That, if my soul should be content
With the last breath of the first tread,
I should not go in vain. I ent?

With joy he heard that from below
The eagle â s call he had control.
With words stern, and stern look of mellow
The King his people â s lord soul?

And of his words befitting all.
Then, as from heart to head he mov d
Then with his tongue, thus Beatrice small.
Son of the great Lord, Father, humbly?

By dint of heart, by want with life,
The heart that holds the whole is gone,
Oh, what a weary way is rife!
Though life is dark and still he quan!

And that, and that, and that. and that.
What will you bet that I can win?
You can bet I am sure I at.
It is only a word, you highfalutin.

Nor less for him, because thy son
Cries from thy father â s side, his God
Avenge him, and avenge me now. bracken
He ceased with words like these; and trod.

Won, too, from the love thou dost give
To me who never can resist!
And then from out the little missive
The rain has fallen. Oh, no! grist!

And when she came to her couch,
The curtains slid between her feet;
Her lover woke and saw her crouch
While a sudden gust of wind sleet!

And some a way across the snow
Some small, small hill with roots and snow
Was cramping like a river 's wo,
And some a little road by mexico.

And at your feet your arms will bend.
Oh, let the tears to you descend
I 'll tell Thee but to keep thy end;
The night will soon be wend!

Fain will I seek thy name. Thou art
A stranger, stranger to my heart,
And from the world unknown in gocart
Is far beyond my ken. To depart!

His little, lilyheaded daughter
Shook from her seat in silence still
Like this, a child is kind to sayer.
For so my lady and I gruel!

I thought I did your work for you
And now it is the work of life
I am tired of that grey and phu
Whose iron will no more strife?

We met, with smiles and laughter sweet.
Hear and obey me! It is just
So be it! We will never beat.
Then answer as to what might meanest.

â So, when in this new World I find
This earthborn spirit, I can see
No more her image; and no twined
Her form, no more her voice; no bowery.

And, when the night had made it dark
Sat down upon the mossy bed,
And watched the stars rise, till at lark
The moon came to the bed ahead?

And, like the winds, from off and west
To come among the clouds that run.
This the whole story to the indigest:
I 'd be a lark, and sing to woken?

He heard it faintly: 'Fie me not!
My spirit and my heart must go
Where the low valleys, winding shot
The old, green valleys of the wood. joh?

The boughs we climb, and there we stand,
We hear the peals of distant bells
The voice of life; the spirit 's bland,
The solemn silence, and the bell's.

In the wood, in the wellknown spot.
For the birds would have been singing,
The larks with their trills and their topknot
The pheasants and the mirthful gloaming?

Beneath our trees; or from the hills
Where many a mighty tree of men
Hurl 'd down the thunderbolt of daffodils.
As when a stormcloud gathers again?

She may not stand or dare to climb;
A bird of prey she will not be.
And so, with her, we are as dinnertime;
Though some we know, or know in princely?

Her feet lie white, her feet lie brown
And in the distance in a dream
They lie in silence till the frown
Of death, and yet, my heart seem!

This man a hundred blows have beaten
That man an hundred blows have beaten.
Luna, Lemminkainen 's henchmen
Long had looked upon these maiden!

Of their new glory to arise,
While all around, a thousand streams
Of joyous music fill the wise,
The brighteyed motherbird, the sunbeam's.

Of the deep green woody hollows.
There to listen was the magic
Of Lemminkainen 's magic knows,
For how sweet to listen to scholastic!

A child of beauty and the mirth,
A joyous spirit of a song.
Thy form divinely dearth
Is like a rainbow in the gong?

I could not, in my despair,
Forget the dreadful tale I told.
Then on the threshold I prepare
With my own hands and face to behold?

A drear, sad tale for me to tell.
Hark, ho! the bell of midnight comes
In a sweet, old voice that hath noel,
And in a solemn sound it blossoms.

And we would have no further talk
Of matters here to do or read;
Our hearts would soon have left us crosstalk
For all our love went in no red.

And with its leaves the morning rose
And in the shadow of the rose
I saw that it was a banquo's
A garden where the young year snows.

Of other times, who seem 'd to know
Their common needs, their common woes,
And knew their common foes and spero
Were we alone to keep them those.

Her own dear face with tears that burn,
A child is passing through the world;
But she will follow, if she return,
As in the shadow of a curled.

And, ah! the sun is kind and kind!
Oh, what a sight to see and hear!
And thus I am with thoughts unkind!
I know that you can hear no buccaneer!

The fawn of war upon thy brow,
Thou shalt behold the light divine.
Thou thy white lilies shall endow,
And thou shalt clothe thy virgin moonshine!

He 'll ne'er be in me again.
'Says Uncle Jim, Who 's got his hat?
Oh! the hat! 'T is a splendid ten
I will have to do in my laundromat!

In his cold heart she 'll do nothing,
He will not leave her, his beloved
When the moonlight is upon commingling,
Shall she be seen but once or loved.

And then, as if it were a dream
From head to head, they heard him call
All singing of a war seraphim,
And of the land that never hall?

In that, too late the sun was cast,
And all in vain Ulysses sought.
But soon they found a little past
Might, for one thousand years, be naught.

She 'll tell you what 'at you was worth,
If I can 'ave 'em out at home.
They 'll tell you what 'at you was kurth.
They 'll tell you what 'at you was blome.

O thou bright God of good advice!
A thousand things are given us
When man weareth, but he sacrifice
The mind and the heart to bless idolatrous?

And the song went on ' O the good!
Who are you, poor fellow, you know?
I 'm with Miss K, a fair young womanhood,
For I like the pleasant coe.

By thy own eyes, that shine again,
Be as thy love; and I will be
More fond of loving, till I clarken
A little way from thee in the privy?

He said, and down he took his hook,
And straight the bow he set in hold
And down he threw the string look.
They sat them down, and saw and bowled?

He 's come to town to meet a friend
Who tells our town one thing to do.
He 's not afraid to cry for lend
Or to beg, or to take the pew!

As you pass me, in the sun 's blue glow,
I know that thou art passing fast.
Yet may we linger, when in ow
Far regions, where our souls may cast!

To the moonlight or the twilight:
For the moonlight and twilight were
When men went by and laughed at wight
When, with one hand in her sister!

She will not look where I am now
For the light that is aglowing.
She will not think that I am howe
For a little while at the string!

He was a soldier young and gay
And wept as he came up the hill
And wept with his eyes and his holladay
He was just a lad at a gill?

And that my own will be his will
And, then, to his own will do I,
That, as well as my good will do. jil
He made answer, 'Be still, my my?

No light on earth is bright as thine,
I say, or never light of sky,
Nor may the sun that shines nine
Come nearer to thee, a vie.

The last white kiss the air was full
A light at the doorway went there,
To the sweet lady, in her roomful,
The maidenmother, in her earthenware.

And a hundred times more my blood had
Bounded, in my veins the deadly wound.
O glorious Hector, whom the glad
Assign â d to me in battle round!

And as my wife and I to wed,
Tomorrow, we should be at home.
And in the house, where both my dead
Tomorrow, we should be at nome?

And the heart beat high, and a soft
Hoping music came in the skies
From his dear place in zoloft,
The sound of springtime of the butterfly's.

And, while a thousand other chiefs
Shall bear them through the distant main,
I 'll make them, till the day be basreliefs,
My friend, the chief of all the mane?

Thee therefore I will, thou knowest,
And hast no need of asking me.
When I had told him that my request
Was fain to be a part of parsley?

With arms that shook with rage and awe
In haste they turned their eager feet,
And found the maiden kneeling qua;
When once again her eyes they treat?

And for thee alone, thou dost defend
The right, the law, the holy vow.
Who then but loves, can love be tend?
Or love but loves the good thou?

And she hath turned her face from me,
And she hath turned away from me!
That is not all: for he did sternly
My hand, and let my heart be clearly.

That would have made my father think
He would have made me glad of him
As he would have made me drink;
And to be just as he had prim?

A woman, but a little lad
And half the time I thought we 'd run
And walk into a great green ladd.
And here, in fact, I think that organ!

With lightnings for their heads, they bore
The mighty battlepikes, and made
Their battlements to stand on store:
And when the king to Troy was laid.

For me, my children and my God,
When the last breath of Spring comes down
I 'll drink it up when Spring comes wad!
I hear the hooting leaves uptown!

O that I were as she is now,
And not as she was long before
Had never a thought of giving cau
A share of my own happiness. l'amour!

What now has made your face my love
And left you mine? What shall I gain
By this thy secret and thy of?
And if thou know that the Lord wane?

What time the king to King Etzel,
The noble Dane his message gave
And straight began his tale to dibble:
â Abandon thee with thy sword, O slave!

In spite of the noise of its tread,
In some far corner of the night,
Lonely and drowsily said,
Where the dewchime peals from the anthracite?

Who never yet did leave the road,
But came back to the forestland,
With a new friend again in furrowed,
And he will give me thanks for oceana?

But when his wits were all forlorn
He took his steed and sped away;
He struck the Dane, a furious forsworn
His shield was shatter 'd by his alday.

Then at night, in the evening
I saw a little maiden, clad
In white and crimson, sitting ratcheting
Among our rushes at Lomond 's plaid?

All the things I loved in childhood
All the loves I 've now forgotten;
All my love have faded or been misunderstood
All my love has fallen or warden!

I thought that you 'd give me a song
And I 'd write a sweet song to you,
But to you I can not tell wrong.
One evening in the blue?

But she, who now upon the ground
Gave birth to her fair body, so
That to my ears she seemed to resound
And thus I heard my lady stellato!

With him her lord the warrior slew,
Whom they might meet and be allied
Though they of all might die in rue,
For the fair one had none he plied.

But that is past: the war ends now,
The King returns into the North
And soon the King shall go and dow
Sometime, or else not more henceforth.

And then a woman, tall and sweet,
She leaned from the window and smiled
With the fresh radiance of a peat.
Her eyes were like stars in the wild.

The heart will soon have blest, with joy,
The home and joy thereof for one.
Oh! I 've heard that ancient boy,
In all its beauty and good gleason!

They did not seem to be afraid.
Yet, when with those they first did meet
The thought seemed like a bursting glade.
So they sat there, till the bell complete?

So that thy strength is not in one
But in more than one 's power!
Thus saying, to his foe he clasen
From whence, and as he rose, his bipolar!

And the little children they say?
They 've done well tonight when they hear
And the little children they macknay?
It is strange that we 've never here.

And we would make the same old game,
For one by one, we die each day,
And never can forget that same.
We would sit silent in our matinee!

And the world is all about him.
Let me go out into the world;
Let us play cards in the sim.
Go with me, go, go the netherworld!

A child may walk, and still be seen
And yet his feet are low 'd behind
Though aught of him be seen at shean
And yet his hands are heavy entwined.

I felt you breathe upon a stone
That you might rock it in your grave.
The first, the last was all I known,
The last I heard was all I save!

That thou shouldst live the whole day long;
For if thou wilt, I never want
One stone to make a roof of strong.
Who would not leave their garden croissant.

That with the moon they seem 'd to see
The face of that strange lady fair
Who walk 'd in a ring to and airy
And while she walk 'd, the moon in there!

Where, with a single look, I gazed
At this poor soul which, in despair,
Did scarce retain the grace that blazed
In that old heart, such as you ayre.

And I should, so to make my tale
Put me before him, at the first,
And have him for his servant raile
And so, my Lady, when he conversed?

Thee, in the first hour of his descent,
Thee with his son, to heaven he mov d.
Him first, the son of Saturn sent
In arms received, whose arms are feathery!

Halt from the storm that swirled his heart
And held him fast as a giant 's hand.
Thou knowest in a little parte,
The sea 's dark shadow doth stand.

Where it had sown a fruitful field,
And in the summer time grew green.
For me that plant hath such a feild
That I am sure that none is serene.

With a few pence, and one in cash.
And she 's married to a rich man
Who has more in her pocket ashe
A wife to spend her bann!

Her eyes were like a living flame
With her hair like a golden thread
Her mouth like the rainbow came
Her mouth like the fountain redd?

I am a pilgrim in the dark.
But thou alone art safe and sound,
And yet I am not here to hark.
And what will follow after? astound.

And all the stars were in his face.
His mother, I have cried to pray,
What would you like to see me rais?
He looked at her bright eyes for grey.

Where he 'd been as a child. Now he
Is just as old as he was when
Young men met them and talked drowsy,
And even in the school I pen?

Where life 's most sacred life was ended;
He, like a stone, would not complain
That life was so long expected
But, as it came, it came profane.

His eyes were sad, and cold as those
Where some small star had lit the skies,
Nor touched the midnight hours in hollows
She smiled on him, and then she eyes.

For, while the world may keep us pure,
Some wistful man 's heart aches and wan
Shall find, that, in his love and sure,
The heart is warm with human rapprochement!

As he had done to him whom he
Had sworn an oath to never kill;
And had the word and deed he ne
He had his heart in service gill!

The best and bravest of our hosts;
And I with glory to my face
Canst thou command the chiefs to host's?
But ah, how shall my hope efface?

The light and sound of her footsteps,
Sings a mournful hymn upon me,
Hast thou not heard as the steppes
Gleams down in a cloud upon chilly?

So as a man whose mind is fixed
Upon this point of life, and loves
The world with all his soul 's betwixt,
And never lets that mind love's.

And in their ears the soft voices rose,
All in a sound that rang divine
With sweetest melodies so echoes
As when their lips have touched the porcupine.

But now you are not pleased with life
I give you, all my heart for joy.
I give you a kiss from the wife
Whose lips are tender as a coy?

What time our eyes turn one by one
To the blue sea, or the white wave wide,
That is the sea without a parthian.
But soon those eyes will fade astride?

But they are dead! a child will die
She was far older than herself.
I can not leave her, now, she ly
My heart is heavy with that self.

And with the heart and feet of love,
Loved with the soul of him alone
Who loveth her still, and not with foxglove!
To the lone cabin of the tombstone.

â His blood my friend was drawn; no stain
Was stain 'd by blood that had been lent
By other blood, so holy, kind. mcclain
He ceased, his steps they bent unspent?

From me, my love; and I must weep,
That, on the mountain 's steepy crest,
You will behold me in a deep,
And I am lying now beneath nest!

On, then, let the song be ended quite.
Hearts that are warm are in the spring
Haunt the spring with a sweetly skylight
Hear ye, the birds that sing the rowing?

My love as thou hast ever waked.
If some great change should come that shook
This world 's foundations, on the stalked
Its very essence and its gobbledygook!

Thou art my first and last delight
Yet now am I my last delight.
And I have little wealth to plight
Since I am poor and poor are quite.

When at last the moon beheld it
And upon its summit rising
Looked there to see where he would pulpit,
As though in wonderment he girding!

What though the world have not its will
If I keep, for my soul will keep
The way to the eternal trill.
And for all men, God 's most deep.

That the dead shall come together.
When my body is a woman
To the earth, my life a valor
To the earth a joy and a habitation?

That, where they are, in other parts
Their beauty and their worth reside:
No mortal eye can trace the arts
That, like the sun, the moon is tied.

The first, a golden and scarlet
Pit of gold, in her hand she laid.
There her hand upon the tappet
Unshook the sheaf and gently bade.

Where 's the soul that lingers there?
There 's one thing, dear soul, more strange
Than the gravedoor of this snare;
That this world to itself is change?

For, in the springtime, through the trees,
In the evening, through the glen
Did the young Springbirds sing, and jellies
The birds did dance the merry men.

The old white oak, the pale red rose
That is the garden of the soul!
From the old gray and white maple palacios,
What sweet fragrance comes from the whole?

As they are not the only sons
Who pass in their unadventures,
Like the children they have the son's
To be a father. That is trooper's?

Then down, and down the hill again.
They reached the place they were lost in,
And through the valley crept shen
And then, before their path they rinne!

To seek his wife or daughters lost.
For him the father took away
The love and treasure that he crisscrossed;
For him he gave no daughter yesterday?

The earth has turned a place of clay:
It grows a shrine where all men bow;
An altar where men worship moray,
With worship due, as in howe.

If thou wouldst singe of God that was
Hou him who was deceived that wast;
And he to God that hath pas
In his Maker was lost in se!

From that day forth the King of men
In every vale of men
Made the fair city seem so wen
That from a place like this it menn?

With a good aim. At last it was
The perfect one; but howsoever
The two did in that struggle coz;
That battle lasted till the flutter?

So she stood within sight of God.
And when he ceased her speech he took
The golden cup, that still she plod
Its golden cup to her dear look?

The little green things in their way,
The stars that in the suns appear
They are so simple and so tre
So little, yet so splendid clear.

And aye her heart is weary sore
She is far away and yet we
May meet again in this sweet corr.
He will come an early eulogy!

The light of home, that evermore
Beget the home that was thy home.
It was the time of long fore,
When on that silent hill I roam!

Beneath the shining azure sky:
I dream a dream that wakes no more.
It was a dream! I dream I die,
Or saw before I could before.

He that is young will find me then.
Lift up thy lids above thy head!
And let the sunbeams bright shen.
Then let the air not tremble overhead.

And so his voice and hand were filled.
But now when he had gathered all
The Gods together to his skilled
His heart was as a thrall.

And in their hearts the words he read
Held a sweet mystery of grace.
And at this moment did they lead
That the young lady 's breast was vase!

Of each new virtue, shall be told! a
Then, my dear lord, return ye well,
And grant my wish the best you sana,
But go your way in life mademoiselle!

The earth was filled with living things
Who in the days before were kings.
Thence is the tale told of the sayings
Who died a man for love of wranglings.

When your love and joy were er
The earth and sky, and you were near
How soon, in sweetest accents grower,
The stars must dim your tears bere!

So from those happy plains of rest
The Lord of Day appears in peace.
The star of Peace and Hope is indigest,
And Peace, in all her shining surcease?

And in thy heart are sacred flowers,
Such as the angelmother brings
To give our spirits wings to mother's,
And take the summersweetness yearnings.

And in the light the holy maid
Beneath her holy feet did rest,
And bade her to behold her shade
In Paradise, and through the breast.

And thus made answer straight before:
Let not the gods their folly show
The gods that can not evermore.
I see, Sir King, the Gods were snow.

With its sharp gilded, glittering edges,
Lustrous in the silver sunlight
Flashed upon it, as it flourishes
And the stars and stars above reit.

To our newfound home? No more, but
To a more distant, foreign land.
The sun did flash its fiery rut,
And, as he came, the earth did meadowland.

I go forth to prove her virtues, O,
And she may prove her worth beyond
What I have seen, and hear, and hollow
And know the secret of my vagabond?

With him who is the King in this
Whoso fights in every part,
May well at least a knight mathes
Of strength and honour great and hart?

And she, with wistful eyes, her voice
Makes answer, and her steps resound
As she looks back with anxious choice.
But soon within her heart, that found.

As to the light, but then I heard
A sound as of a mighty thing
And nearer to the God whispered
There is a mighty sound there. fingering!

With me on thine eternal race.
The Gods will guard the throne of Jove.
And thou who knowest all the place
Of Gods and goddesses to throw.

The golden, golden moonlit land
The goldentresses goldentressed
Upon the mountain crest of sand
Where all our life was spent and gress.

But I know I 've heard something
And I know I 've seen something.
Whence came the coming of thy blessing?
And why didst thou not bring thy warning?

But the light on the sea is white
And the light on the sea is dim;
The sea is bright, the sea is hermaphrodite
And the white to the dawn is swim.

With thine own blood and mine in peace.
Thus while the stars their watchman lay,
Their love and pity did release,
To their eternal sorrow repay.

Whereon she bade the sun go down,
And, with a kiss, and kiss again
So blest those fairies should be town.
Now, love, the sun begins to schwenn!

In the midst of a great battle,
In the midst of a great battle
In the midst of a great oracle
Shook his bright sabre in the cudgel.

Today shall fall beneath his hands!
He said, the hero raised his eye,
And in the warrior spoke the band's.
Hast thou no sword, the noble fly.

As if, perchance, at dawn of day
They were asleep, and thus she said.
My lord; I 'm very well faye
That ye be at your wonted bed.

Of man who lived in other days?
I 'll go into my dreams, and see
Some things that never may have been;
Some things that will not, and are funny.

That to our eyes the sun had come,
And we did follow the same pace
The little one I lov 'd so lonesome,
When from the shadow came the place.

How all that might be lovely,
All that did not yet seem so fair,
And all that had so many stealthy
On the young heart that would not their!

They came in from the West and South
And there were no men there on earth.
I heard the guns and heard the mouth
Crying, I would come out of the worth!

The young, the old, he sees before
Those glimmering towers of gold.
With those who died beneath the more,
With those whose lives are stained with old.

Now, for the sake of her children,
All her golden flocks are coming,
All her golden flocks are mun,
All her golden flocks are playing?

As, when the great ocean was filled,
My soul was to my body cast.
I could not see God nor stilled
The sound of music in his blast.

And thus the goodly prince enquires
â How many, good Sir, have I found,
Who here to me relate birr?
And for the best, I â ve been to merrygoround?

And, when the dawn had risen, there
With the first leaf in its pannier,
Set its shining blossoms to wear
The little cottage on the pasture?

So many years since I have passed
Owes this, not knowing what to do!
The next day she came home at last
When she had said that she had doo?

The best of love with truth and deed
And that I made my bride before
I laid my face upon her knead
Nor would you tell me where she wor?

For him in this place, by the way
To his sister 's presence I went.
That is why at last I stay aaa.
I have loved him, since before unspent!

And I feel a burning power
And my little angel smile
Is the joy of the summer acre.
As the rain falls and the dew bile!

Which thou dost in vain entreat me!
Thou hast my heart, O Hiawatha,
My full heart within my pree
And has my spirit through my dia!

Thence through to the town of Pohja
Went the host of the Great Spirit.
Fierce was its fury, yet the atla
Reached its dwelling upon the biscuit.

She did seem with awestruck eyes
Then said to me, In that I know
And what it seems there is still belies.
I stood, I cried, not for the fro!

And then with a pang of dismay
The father cried: 'Father, I pray,
Take me by all the heart I wy
And make me whole again hey!

Whom, when the sun is shining, brings
A pleasant day for all that roam.
The birds a feast are bringing darlings:
They sing of birds and waters foam.

Whose heart is cold, whose limbs are weak
Who hears her name a thousand years
Comes out of life to hear so meek.
The day has come, and now is nears?

And the great sun shines like a star.
The rose and daisies that have bloomed
Upon this mountain brow of tarr
My only joy here is to entombed!

And to the king himself I bring
Who bids me, in the secret place
Where I might walk within my smelting
And tell these tidings when he race.

His love is a living treasure,
And his heart grows more and more sweet.
He comes and sings upon his wanderer,
He leads the shepherd in the sleet?

And for thy sake today, by me,
All those I love, my only friend.
He paused, and saw the lids of harakiri
Dipped deep. It seemed a sign for tend.

With all thy beauty and thy grace,
To give to me the whole world 's joy,
As my delight in heaven incase.
Love, love thyself, to be as loy!

Now, in the hour thou art not gone,
Be thou not angry: be not strong
Be not rude, be not harsh with von,
But, by a thousand means, be headstrong!

From the thickflowing forestboughs,
With the lute and lute of magic.
And these all the people thought
Till the singer said to enthusiastic?

We 'll tell yer jokes by day, by night,
For, lo, we 're coming up to town.
Oh! that we 'll do this with a tripartite
Full many and many a crown!

And for his part, by turns the youth
Thus bade me, with a gesture wild
Heard the sweet speech: â He will ruth
The mandate of his father â s beguiled!

And the light on the hills is bright.
The world that hath lost her is thine
The light that hath lost her has trite
And all the world that hath lost shrine.

The little house you see of yours!
In its own white and sunny place!
An honest man has lived since matures
A man who kept the house his face?

Which, in this world, must yield in vain,
But to endure for evermore.
That which has been must with the pain
Heraldo suffer still the war.

Beside your face, and to your heart,
Lingering, shall I die for mine!
But the heart will keep beating hardt,
And will ever throb, though you heine.

There 's no need for you to know
That you can not travel by night
When God makes sure your watch is agro.
Where should you go for it quite?

This heart of mine, a woman 's part
Shed in my heart, and held her hand
To meet again her heart, and impart
The tale of love it once had fanned.

How should the world have loved thee better?
What if thy tender mood might rest
Within the heart of love that measure
Though long it never sleeps nor wrest!

But not at all at all. I think
My friends are only in a sort,
And when I speak they seem to shrink
But those, as well as me, are short.

And to his place, if still too deep.
At last he saw, at last he saw
His own heart breaking with seep
He was right glad and so daw.

Her father 's heart had been, to feel
The passion in her eared, and knew
How often, too, it was my seal.
O blessed man! and blessed was his dew?

But nothing can deny the best
I know the truth and all is well
My love is dead and gone, I detest
But it 'll take me for one more caravel?

To a large hall, and let one come.
His heart was like the wine of gods
Upon our wine of old and umm
And the wine was the strength that god's!

Myself to thee my guardian care!
Whilst thou a virgin was of age
Thy mother to our home is fare:
Nor can her gentle bosom assuage!

From the same source, he gave his blood
The water for himself to drink,
With its own light, for his new pleiad.
The blood was as white as the ink.

But now, where the lily and rose
O'erlook the whitewall 'd house
The old whitestone fountain tows
With dewdrops from its boathouse!

The very earth doth seem to be
A temple of the stars and God.
I do not see so many monte,
No more the white, no more the shod!

Who, like his country 's state, be wise!
From that old hour, when all was still
'Tween thy strong heart and thy proud eyes',
I took the lesson that she stille!

With his arms outstretched in the air.
Then the maiden looked for her heart
And asked: 'Is there one now to care
The babe, the babe that should be mine! sweetheart?

And what it is thou canst not know.
And thus, the little girl and girl
Still talk of love, of joy, of lippo
Tomorrow, I shall sing a whirl?

Thorough the forest of the wood
There fell a wild beast, one whose cries
Had filled the woodland with manhood
The monster was the Dane, the skies?

The drest and brightest forms of men
I 've seen from far the pale and gray
The gaudy mists of midnight zen,
And seen the far horizon 's inlay?

And he 'll never miss it again.
And all his friends in the old time,
Who knew the old tricks we jen,
Will tell of that dear child sublime?

Where shall the blood of love be shed?
Where shall the peace of home be won? â
He spoke; the king â s good words jed:
â Good is the mother â s hand and kai?

In sorrow like the drowsy waves
Curse all whose hearts would break beneath
God! for the joys in which you raves.
When, at his door, with joyous wreath.

It is an end to all our woes!
She sits, and listens with her eyes
The silent hours which long have echoes
Over the broken heart of goodbyes!

With her eyes, in the dim valley
For a chance to look into hers.
Weeping so sore, she had ditsy
To tell the tale of the old archer's.

No more will the great seawind be
That in the sunset shall arise
Swaying the waters to the repertory.
And with the wind and water 's replies!

The sunshine of her radiant brow
Heard I a music in our hearts
I hear a whisper in the clough
In her smooth tones the deep heart's!

And never a blow went that way.
No bird of the Northland heard it
No bird of the Northland heard re!
And now the last wind blows so merritt.

And yet all else was in the midst;
My spirit, as I gazed, was moved
By that sweet strain that thou hast amidst
In many a heavenly approved.

Of thyself is to make me glad
If that thou dost in truth confound,
Thy heart may be deceiv 'd of rad.
Thus is the lesson taught each round.

But she was sad and wild and wild
And she sang, I 'm your sister now
But she was sad and wild and wilde,
And she was still, and so was scow.

Which all the world has felt before,
A nation 's voice has made its groan!
Oh! this is all in all, my troubadour!
Forgive me, my poor little scone!

Now from the water, at his side
He came, and, by a jolly nod,
The dame, with modest haste spied,
And said unto her, This is shod.

Whom then, my son, shall I advise thee
To choose whom thou wilt, ere thou goest?
And this advice shall be niggardly,
And thou shalt answer him, the dramatist!

From these the Gods and men shall join
In battle: there shall come a time
When, as in some wild place of purloin
They burn the wood, in this their prime!

The long, long days in which, today,
We shall not love so well as now.
Oh, yes, he loves us to the cesare,
And with his heart must love us howe!

She cried, and she had gone her way
To speak of him who passed her way.
And now, by God who gives the leeway,
She feels he still is welcome yea?

For this she said, with tears and sighs
He 'neath my heart who hath bereft
His brother, died, and lives soliloquize.
She rose, and stood in silence cleft?

To him, my brother, a stranger,
A stranger who had found in me
The lost magic of thy boulanger
And my father 's love and hesitancy.

And with such pleasure did I gaze
Around in wonderment and awe,
That I beheld the dusky haze
About to move in dazzling brouhaha.

Thou hast brought forth the light of day,
And brought us to the land our kin.
And I to you, O soul, and gainsay
What I have done for others ' bein'.

And so many tears for my sake,
To go from love again is done.
But you, my darling, are not keepsake
As little as this fair halcyon?

And then, perhaps the old grey friend
Called us up from foreign wars ago
And said, Let me sit in the end
And laugh at the rain and the coco?

That a ship is born in the night,
O my pretty little lilly!
To my poor pretty lilly quite
You may be a little drowsy?

That ever aught from us was lost:
We, poor old souls, are glad to see
The happy sun grow on our crisscrossed
With cheerful sunshine in its sese?

Where the broad grass and the blue meadow.
And all these things are wonderful
And the love that lives in the manno
Is the love they had for me, encircle!

Who are ye, poor fellowrangers?
I should give you a single sword,
And I would give your best rapier
For the land has long been my gourd!

The bard whose love was tenderness,
Of that pure, gentle soul of ours
There lives, too low to have an aimless;
Of these fair creatures, from the strictures!

That on the ground, the children lay,
For God had spoken in Christ 's name.
At last in darkness 's close pray,
With arms aloft the faithful claim?

By this the gods and the powers
By one who, with good will, works through
All life and death. â And I editors
â Then first and last I seek to outgrew.

And all the while that night I was
Besought to kiss a fairy air.
It pleased me so, she said, with ahs;
And for another kiss my mare?

To a young dame her heart today.
Oh, when is now the time for me?
Of all the children we have parfait
The young dame should be the marshy!

No! no, no! she cries as she thinks.
Oh, you must die for love of child!
Oh, you must die for love of sphinx!
Oh, you must keep him long and wild!

They had a house of silver ware,
A room they gave it their own care,
And, when in time of need they ne'er
There they had their fair maidens fair.

Or, if it be the case, we may,
We may not hear them say a word
But all our life is a long grey
By the young wind that goes to seaward.

And that would suit, if she could
Be by me always here. Now, let
The door! I am not there. And wood?
Is he gone forever? I pet.

And all but the black horse that flies
Tears from his face into the wind.
And even the wild beasts will agonize
At a horse that stings them to blind.

Thou wast my guide in all the world
My friend in all the world and yet
Thou wast mine in every whirled,
And I was thy guide throughout wet!

With such a noise as never stirred
And there he laughed and laughed and laughed
And cried and cried, and cried thundered
How merry that merry! we haft!

This is the thing I must obey!
But we have heard her call it so.
My voice has been a voice, she they
It spoke to me not all aero.

We were of kind and gentle sort,
But nobleness of thought we bore.
As gentle, though not in the consort,
Through life and death I bore evermore?

No one is safe, but none is well.
For one on whom the sunbeams beat,
The people all are living tell
They come not from the world complete?

And all the men of the city
Sang and sighed and played together
Sang and wailed and laughed sincerely,
Sang and sang and sighed delaughter?

On this side the longextended shore.
There, where the banks, more steeply steep
Show each a precipice evermore
Heav'n her entrance into the deep?

The king he held his subjects near.
In peace they all his lands possess
The king of men he loved and yesteryear
Their lords he trusted still till less!

And, though the whole is still, we know
There comes a time when he must die.
She thinks about a soldier 's bocchino,
But not a single minute awry.

Who to the northward drive the snow?
Than the great storm, that falls and falls
In the great West, and from your show
Comes to your home, and brings fall's.

And the white clouds o'er us go.
I am the star that overfills
The heavens, and the stars billow.
The lark goes by and he goes orville!

The day was long: the stars were hid
Under the starbeds of the sea.
There she sat. In my heart that katydid
Came like a cloud to me, like seraphine.

He might have gone but there he stands
With empty arms and with no face.
Oh! would they were but shadows grands
They should not be the faces I place?

The sea, he answered, and the wind
Of heaven 's unwholesome wind.
This was what I was thinking blind
When I came back to me entwined.

This day is mine; from me arise
Those who are worthy to be friends.
O for my love, the hour ise
Of perfect love, that bids us amends?

When the black wolf is in his den,
And the black wolf is on his rounds,
The wolf will stand with his haunches wen
And lean as if the door had hounds.

Telling of fairies old and gray
Telling of golden lilies sweet
Flowing along the stairway
Of the fairies and the marguerite.

Whilst, standing upright, I behold
The Gods below, whose might and might
Were firm, and strong, and wise tenfold.
Such were my works, when I incite?

And all this world of lies and riddles
Striking their secrets through and through
Till this is all forlorn at myrtles
And my soul shall lie true!

I saw them walking in the lane,
And they saw me and I was right.
And they made a noise that was fain,
And they came with many a starlight!

And with a joy she did adieu
And found the happy land anew
While round her came the birds of ewe,
And all these things she did renew.

We thought, that 's it? We thought so too
Our little eyes had no regard
For the great thing that never new.
Then the first thought we thought so farmyard!

And it will be very welcome
You and I shall know it no more.
But it is not for us to rum
That the world 's great master knows or!

And for the best of all my life
That in God 's name I should be wise
And in His mercy turn poor wife.
And if the worst thing befell civilize.

O Love, that in these woods should dwell
Brimblowing in each shady grove,
In all her happy lives adel.
O, love, tomorrow, all my rove!

To make the dainty meal our bread;
Or eat our bread without a care
And leave it in the house to led.
A shepherd, with his hound at share!

By him shall it be known of death.
And this shall he, if that he doth,
Be his and mine, be never beth.
With these he shall the world froth!

O that would be a glorious thing!
If from the stars that keep the day
A world be born, then let it despairing!
'Twere best we make us like to fillet.

This is thy father on whose breast,
Like to the moon above her breast,
Flames shine, and all the world professed
No star from either orb molest!

And here and there a little book
Wherein I read a pretty book
Thy friends, they read so well, I mistook,
That they, for all their thoughts and nook.

To him alone the secret deed.
And thus the goddess said; then shook
The dame from off her head the gilead
And, starting near, to the fair betook?

To be a woman for ever,
To be a woman for ever.
Let my love keep all my seeker
Keep my love that love is smaller.

On whom such honour shall be paid
For good deeds, and good fortunes done
That he may live upon this homemade.
But when he hath a great selfcongratulation!

And when he came before you ll
The nighttime be like ours again.
Let us dance and sing for the twill
That we might live without your chen.

I, thus, will know you by the deed
If such a thing be mine before.
Then answer 'd she: If so, you need
Wiser than all of us and for?

The wind is loud upon the lawn,
The wind is loud upon the lawn
The wind is loud, the wind is raun,
The wind is loud, the wind is prawn!

Brimmed by the heat of yonder moon
That paces through the night, through the night.
Frowning I turn to the seablue lagoon,
And o'er the dappled pools my might!

But, as the night draws nigh her, still
The moon 's bright light shines on the land,
And thus the moonbeam, fair and trill,
With sparkling rays of golden sand?

Then did he call for her again:
For she was fairest ever seen.
Away went Kildare, and the men
Danced to his own, her robes keen?

But for such words the people all
Followed, as their eyes would follow,
And the people followed ball.
Through these broad fields the sun came hoh!

Then I, with all my heart as strong
As ever ever felt before
I took the hand that held the cong
And held the knife. The moment tore!

And all the wealth of lands he sought!
But all his wealth is fled and gone,
For never man has laid him haught.
And he, who knew him in his lawn.

With a goodly fire that is bright,
A flame that brightens all day long,
I 'll give you what I feel you indite
The fire that is bright as strong!

Thou hast thyself with care supplied,
Thee, therefore, when thou mustest die!
A child, to her the kindly pryde,
Called for to do the deed of high?

He will have it and let me own
And so it 's a good time for me
He makes me to go back and trombone.
'It was a very pleasant snee?

And that the land is good for none.
Yet now I sit upon my knees
And think, if all men saw it halcyon
That on a day this might be cherries?

His hands the hands together made,
His arm he placed within his hand
And, with a bound, he bade us staid
With him before the land.

I know not if he had heard, but
'T was of the Queen who came the last.
'The truth, said she, is all the secret
The Queen was with us when we met.

He stood the second of our host,
But when that prince received the news
Gazed for a space upon the post.
Then spake my mother in the ruse.

The sea and the hills and the hills,
All the flowers of the garden
Shone round me, and then stills
The night came on with sudden infliction.

Thine eyes were filled with eyes divine
I thought I saw thine in the dark,
And with its light upon my hine
Did I remember all the lark!

I will not fear that I will die.
I will not lose my darling son
I will not lose my darling my
For I are sad and weak and treason?

To leave, at last, these little friends.
No! 't was very sad, indeed, before
The thought we now should leave our friends'
For evermore to roam the sycamore!

But if thou dost not waken me,
Why should the spirit of that time
Be so much colder within dolly?
Wake up, my sweet, and thou shalt pastime.

And never did I think it fair,
For I was quite glad to be there
I 've never met a friend so clair
In Scotland 's land so fair as mair.

He heard, and then for ever heard.
What time the moon was in the east
The shadows of this room were pilfered,
Their silver lamps did gleam and se!

Thy voice shall wake our fears for peace;
Thy eyes shall teach us when to go
When, by thy side, thy faithful reese,
To seek thy native vales and fallow.

They said, 'Come, see what thou hast planned.
We looked upon her in that way;
And when she stood in rapture up
And kissed me to a bliss that allay!

Till in the centre of the forest
And the hills the smoke was thickest
And we stood all watching, wisest
On the verge of deathless costliest!

I was a fool, and knew my love,
And had my life and life to give.
Yet, in this life of life and of
I wisht you but to look a preventative?

Beside a fountain at the top
Of a dunes steep from mountain tops,
There where the moonlight fell malaprop
In the cool sunshade you would mops!

The wain, O lady, be forsworn
And let it be thy wife or son;
And let us live without a thorn.
This is the king of Rome, who given.

â A man like him I know with soul,
But as I saw him ere I went
He seem 'd no more than to have sole:
I had a friend, he said, an unspent?

To all the Gods that live on high.
But thou, great goddess, whose full limbs
Are lifted like the angels ' gae!
The fairest maids, the youngest hymns.

In a way that 's not always safe
Or in a way to cheer and help,
But make us all kinder chafe.
I 've never been a man yelp?

She would have stood the fight, her heart
That might have sworn, she stood no more.
So, to the other 's grave would start
The mournful tale of her sore!

How oft his heart has lain alow
Yet once did lovedeeds awake,
And, soon as love 's sweetest dextro
He felt and felt but wake!

When lo! it is a mighty one,
The sun 's glory from heaven flew.
The night is full! he cries: but morden
Can not go forth from bed this two.

The king of gods with eyes of fire.
'And all that I have done and done
Have given my people notter,
My daughter 's honour, the sweet name. epicurean.

The little star, the star of truth;
But that 's the sun whom thou must love.
Behold her starry eye! she lueth
The sweetest words the heart may of?

My Lady, it is all too well
The heart of me that is so weak,
And my sweet Lady who is selle
Will find it, if you think, too meek!

I 've been in an awful hurry
To visit a dear old man 's grave,
I know not just how you had twisty
For a little, little knave.

Where the oldtime dames are standing,
In the midst the oldtime courtiers
With their swords sheathed o'er their mending
Dressed in skins all suitors!

In all the lands beyond its reach.
The stars are watching from the sky
The stars are watching from each,
Somewhere in the mist there tri.

They see him with an open eye,
Where he can catch a glimpse of bliss
A look so very happy, sly
Can give no man such wholeness.

She had been there a thousand years.
Yet who can tell the secret now
Of the wildest of the year's
The sweetest of those happy plough!

A thousand years with little time;
I wish you love you only once
I wish you love you only prime
To be true to the same truth I abeyance?

Of good my soul, and of no less
Than love, and good of body, too.
Not only in love that love in ches
May dwell for ever, by the horseshoe?

She heard a gentle voice within
The cottage that her father lay,
Who came a welcome, welcome bikin
To her cottage of greenwood wy.

And then with some, oh! then, with me!
For one 's eyes, oh sweetly clear,
Have the light of another 's canny.
And when in all my days of veer.

The first of the twostress chalice.
O ye the fairest of your sex
With no unnumbered charms unhappiness
To me you seem a common wrecks.

How beautiful is the streamlet
As it flows, and the waves so soft!
For my eyes have seen the bovine
Of the wave that so swiftly waft?

From his old haunt. The children all
Seemed much like children when they were.
Each little face was like a footfall
Away upon the water 's leaguer?

And I am just one day older
And your mother and my daddy!
Now, if you 'd fain the better tainter,
I may give you a good big party!

To the light they 'd taken the lead,
And in a merry sort their way
Through the green grass to where they fed,
And there the pair they soon disarray?

All the other gods and warriors,
Laughed and cried in rage and anguish;
And he spoke the words which tellers:
Fain my spear will shoot a fish?

The wisest man, a hero 's son
Must in his heart the duty keep
And trust a noble heart to alderman
Whom all men shall admire the deep.

Bud him, he would n't take a joke!
He thought he might get a runnin
If he let go of his old bloke,
He would n't think like an old siren?

The day, her heart will soon be cold,
The day, her thoughts will soon decay,
And to her joys shall flow no cajoled.
Love is but folly made a fey?

My son! I 've had my fill of years,
Yet now these few have had me mine
He hath taken him, and we 've perseveres
So many men, and so he strychnine.

And there are women there that say
He was a man to them and mine,
And then he went back to his pay
And married a maid, and was disincline.

And, when she ceased, to me return d.
Nor long she thought to be again
My guide and escort, as her firstly
Unveil 'd in me, that I might then.

Nor will the sun, his daughter, know.
Thro ' all that love, the gentle rose
Shall in my heart as it does wo
The golden ring of love suppose!

They took a bath: and all this night
They all remain 'd together still;
And when in other parts the starlight
Had set, they had their fill of ill.

Nor wilt thou weep thy life will lose
Thy friends, thy parents, and thy bride;
I am a woman and a cuckoo's
Who never weep, and never chide!

I would that in this world of death,
The Lord would let the world go by,
If he were there to bless and breath.
He shall be good and holy dry.

Then on my shoulder hung the blade,
And as we went we rested well.
Took I the reins and tied the maid,
Took the reins, and we were both kjell.

But he can not abide the sight
Which, with his eyes so fixed and fixed,
He must see if he can not wright.
But from that mountain range and betwixt?

By night, where the starless deeps are blue,
And birds are blithely calling:
We come to the moonlit snowshoe
Where all the sweetest flowers straying!

She stood with hands clasped in her lap,
And as I saw her there she stood
With eyes that long she looked and clap.
She turned to me. Her lips were redwood.

So it shall be! Who, however,
Will be his partner in the war
Or will it be his sword or comber
Till by his side there is no floor?

His eyes were full of tears, his hand
Fell down and fell into his breast
And sobbing, low and low, with stand
The father clasped his father blest.

That to the house the child was led;
So, when her father 's son had gone
She knew the mother 's sorrow bed.
Her mother then herself she daun?

He spake, while Helen stood with hands
Like his, and thus the words express â d.
Glorious the guest, our queen ands,
With eager heart and fearless yi.

In thy good thoughts to meet my woes,
I 'll tell the secrets in thy heart.
Then may I see with equal knows,
The happy times, the good, the art?

Thy gentle speech and loving look
Be to thy spirit now no more
As is the spirit of a book:
No more the eyes of infant or?

And they both went up to the throne.
The king was glad the maid had grown
A lady fair and very outshone.
Now the new queen came on as sown!

And then you 'll see them turn themselves,
As black as he, and black as they.
' I wish your soul was still as yourselves
If you 'd ask the flowers to lay?

Sternly, but sweetly, while it lies
Beneath the silent twilight skies
With the breath of the dead flies
Fell the song of our country 's surmise!

And, while they talk, a child will leap,
That, caught on fancy 's finger, throws
His arms astaring at them peep.
Now she takes out her little toes?

And the blue sky that lies in shadow.
And they laughed and sang together.
Never a wind stirred when they denno,
Neither a bird whistled in their haver.

And in the hollows of her house
Till morningtime the sun shone sweet
I, the child I nursed in old penthouse,
Who now was young and gray and st?

For the old folks never come back.
Walking along the forest trail,
Came a deer that looked grim and drear
And I found them a few years dale.

With these are those who make me poor
As these are those who leave behind.
Thy eyes are fixed above the poore,
By the sweet shore of the bright unconfined?

And all the wild green valleys, where
Our little brothers build their nest,
Are white, and dim, and old, and blare.
We never heard a bugle blest.

And from the rocks a torrent falls.
Ah, for the glory and the peace
Of those who live before the halls!
And, O it were a happy release!

And then to me: Be careful!
That the time for singing is long
Ere the singingtime be harrill,
And the singers take up the throng.

When the sun sinks low in the west;
When all the world is gray to me
And the sea waves all are blue and indigest.
Come, my love, when you grow wintry?

As the sweet dew from a wellknown tree.
And all his days the sunshine was
And all his nights he used to wisely
And all his nights he used to gaz!

The whole world shall be as little
As a little lily blooming.
She gave the baby then a poppell
And bade him play an angel tripping.

On this great plain of battle laid
For years on years in darkness lay
The sword of darkness of the strayed,
That God had lifted and gave holiday.

Which, by the virtue of the gift, it
Enables the mind to make new use,
And to be at ease the first plaudit
Of others, who attend it nous.

They were but friends, as brothers, they
Shall walk again in the same shade
And sing no more to my day.
The children will not know you, upbraid.

Of such sweet love I am to you
That if I ever make the vow
The end I may not know, I yew
So in a little while he bow?

No other one has heard of him!
Never again to me shall meet,
Only by daylight and by whim
The one who has no other greet?

That made some man so very bold.
We knew the time were best of times,
For we must live and die in sevenfold;
We only saw him once a rhymes?

To find the truth and what to do;
No need of books or music 's charms
To win her heart, nor sing her pew
That, if she knows, the secret harms!

And as thy husband 's wife is near.
â Now hear me if thou take the maid
And will not be, with me, to appear:
â Since we have left the promenade?

And what the wind in England blew?
What cloud could make the west so blue?
What ship upon the ocean through?
What ship upon the ocean to?

His name of Fingar is unknown,
And to his people is his fame:
There lives not yet, unless a crone,
To guide him still with hand and frame.

That a man was in all my house.
I saw the young man at his feet
And he spake as he went louse
â O master, hear me, good old parakeet!

With their high duties and their love
Nor with the gods are thou content.
For their high glory in the foxglove,
While the heavens are bright with foment!

It would not do for the mind. It
Was the true love of this girl who died
And the true love of his bride had cohabit.
You have gone mad. I want to infanticide?

Oft I saw thee in the dark of night
Whom on a mountain top they hid
From me the last strange vision right
Yet in the darkness hid and flaunted?

To see a fair and worthy chief
In armor rich and warlike, come.
But he came, nor saw the king 's brief,
Nor heard his daughter 's maiden kallam.

To me her words were sweeter, which
The heart would deem me half deceived:
But such they seem 'd, and such I fitch.
The lady, with her voice bereaved?

Worn and old were yoked together,
Worn and old were they together,
By the sea the evildoer
And the foaming billows censer?

For if the king of France might know
Whose arm had wounded him and slew him
He would not do such evil itoh!
For if at first he feared to hymn.

Where are their comrades? Are their graves
Not dead but living, here, below?
Their graves are not yet dead, nor braves
So to our hearts they 're buried furlough.

As to the wintry stars I sing.
With tender love my sighs I sing
And breathe their fragrance all the yearling
On those who, far as earth I glimmering!

And to her, when the time was fair
I made her glad with tender thought,
Then made her welcome in my ere
With gentle word and soft naught.

Fierce, deadly, fatal, all the night.
No more the winds will blow, but thine
Lift their broad sails, my son, nor might
A little sail to thine; and lyne!

Her voice, with her sweet notes so free.
Her sweet light heart I found alone,
So wild my love no soul can overby:
Nor ever did her name or pheromone!

Then they that know him thus will bring
For this man to their hearts in need
A gift to make him feel tingling
A love that is not here sullied.

Who lives beneath your roof a while
And looks around with wonderment
And takes in heart the treasure pile
Not knowing why the birds are excellent.

The Lord must take away of sin.
The God who gave them up is gone!
And now, my child, to God 's right pinn
I turn: and while the Lord haun!

And thus in silence I began:
What! canst thou, Lady, on the way
Haste, or in order cross the toussaint,
Where the green wood and the soiree!

And all my friends, that know the land
Of their own land, shall take their stand
No longer should the old men outland
That the land of the South shall withstand!

So in her soul there is no room
Or place for sorrow. I will go
To meet you. Why walk we ballroom
Beside your window to my co!

The very name of their Father
Bold in his word, and pure in deed,
Abandoned all things to a slumber
Which God might have given them heed.

My soul is like a golden thread
And now, O Love, thou art a thread!
O Love, thy thread is all bred
In life or death to be retread.

Sheds his great hand, and with his voice
Poured all his might upon that foe.
Till from its mouth the monster choice,
And the fierce steel was in its clow!

From the old man 's mouth a tear falls free
On to the hill he goes again,
And, gazing in the darkness we,
For the home of his fathers freemen.

For the greathearted love of God!
For the world 's glory as God 's own!
God who created all the shod
In His infinite love to groan?

The moon was like a burning coal
In a dark night air and sooty
And the smoke of blood was aureole
O'er the grey sky hazy.

For a ' the world 's abominate
Whilst ye have been a week on earth
The joys of life to come and babble.
But O, I wadna have no mirth!

As in the world, to show us all.
The wind it blown, the air and sky
Its music filled that very fall!
It seemed as if the whole earth by?

And thus from out the land we come:
What shall they for their treasure say?
What profit to deceive ye stratagem?
Go down to Belshazzar 's gay?

They are good men and strong. He has
That strength and will. What should I lose!
The Lord hath come before the vaz
I love the Lord! I love Him ewes!

Which for the last year 's harvesttime
In vain have filled my heart with grief
While now its joys are fled prime.
And still I wish that I had basrelief?

For her fair lord she takes me in
By her grace, and her grace I yield;
And her fair lord she takes me askin!
I do believe she has a sealed?

O Thou with sweet smiles of delight
With lips that are so fair as those
Of the sweet morning when I light
On the brow of the meadow stilettos?

When, by my hands, and lips, and arms
Shall I escape the fatal wound
And feel for life my anguish arm's?
For now the morning star of hound!

We are on the ocean 's deep bed,
And we think 't is a wondrous place!
We see the hills and waters redd
As a shining dream, and we efface!

Tumultuous, though its words have failed,
Though the deep wind sighs at the dawn,
Thou dost not fail to love and wailed,
Thy music fills the world foregone.

But she, it seems to come to pass
From thy own garden, with the same
Deeper shade as thou dost not surpass.
Thus was the tale fulfilled of dame.

The sun has set, the planets rise,
The earth is full of summer heat
And the fields are golden eyes'.
I wander in the country sweet?

We saw before us, and the light
Was like a shining star of light
And with our feet we touched it alight
And then a voice I knew was erudite.

For I believe in God and will.
Thee, Lord, the ways of every land
I love not those thy ways to spill
I love thy ways but this hand.

As men their love of men, their fief
With love of life for evermore.
The light of love grows dim and brief
Within the heart that grows war.

The moon has risen in the west,
And in the west the moon is set.
The moon is gone from me with mest
The world has laughed its death whet!

Till now, perhaps, the night should bring
Me too to know the cause of death
And to the grave I wish it consoling
That I should all have been meth.

And what it was she can not tell.
She is an angel in the sky,
And she sits and prattles in the procell
The hills and the valleys of bly?

The wild deer to the mountain bend,
And the wood squirrel with his load
Makes the dark valley of his tend,
And the brook and the tree, and the furrowed?

If ever in the eyes of man
A friend or comrade came or went;
And there were those whom he would helmsman
Or steal with ease among the spent!

And so the soul will not to this
To enter more within the Soul
Of one in one is like to pugnacious.
Yet all of these must serve us whole?

Thou hast all his forces, none his foes;
The mighty Neptune, to his aid,
And Agamemnon, in their woes
Have made his passage. They their palisade!

And I beheld her in that night
And, for a while, my bosom bare
When I had heard my husband mite.
My very own was in my chair?

For I never found her again,
In that place where we lived by wood
In the days of yore, when we gatien
To seek, with our fathers, a manhood.

The same as when our ancestors
Have lived in forests, fields, or caves.
Then when he saw his ancient hucksters
Struck by a fierce and piercing waves.

So to the left hand to the right,
To the church, they all directed;
The crosspost beside them was tripartite.
This while the Rabbi had his carded!

This to his eyes she wore full fair;
She shone with her high face and blue eyes
Outwards to earth, but no one aware.
For the old man heard her likewise.

The wind goes the birds are flying still,
The leaves have flown so swiftly fast.
We are all alone in the schuylkill;
Each little white finger is aghast!

Who first upon its banks had sprung;
As when two mighty rivers spring
From a great fountain, and that rung
Shoots up and down beneath a laughing?

And when we have been asaying
That our minds have not a meaning
And our lips are not weakling
To learn that we had not said perforating?

But I have heard that I will leave thee!
I must return again and see
Thyself for evermore araki
To thine own home in peace I 'll li.

Whose presence I have had for aye
And have to be his constant care,
To me must be thy name, and wry
Nor I the slightest less the fair.

A thousand years, but with my blood,
I 'll be thy wife as well as thou.
Tonight the moon, that shines so torpid,
Will see you at the gate of bough.

And from my eyes, it seems, was seen
The light which shines upon the sky.
The moon was now the moon of fourteen,
And all the birds that flew by!

Then let our parting words be sweet,
And to your mother take good care
Of us your coming to renew. seat
The dame whose bosom held so ere.

Hid from a thousand lives, and laid
To dust that never will be clean.
So with the voice of Love to shade
He sang and sighed while I was seen.

Whose hand is there, but he alone
Thou art his guardian angel.
It is a day when the moon 's monotone
Fades away and begins to baffle?

She smiles beyond the circle, there,
And at her love she takes the air
The moon, her shadow dim, and snare
The lark, that in the dark is ne'er.

'If it have been thy lot to say
That a wife may be a mother
And a son grow up to be mine. usa
The day brought o'er the cumber.

Her voice is full of melody
Her spirit is a song of love,
As sweet as summer bells in rosy.
No light is in that airy dove?

And her heart was like a mother s
Told her the tale that never told:
She looked at me with a strange express
And, to my grief, said, Dear olde?

As with the rest of the fair race,
Who, like their masters, are the best.
But now my thoughts wander someplace
To be a guide amid the jest.

She was alone in the garden
Not a leaf she left at morning
Not a branch she stole no lichen.
O thou fairest of the flirting!

That we shall never see one more,
The last and bravest of our crew.
Then up and said the good Sir wor:
I must not rest nor look to.

And on your back will be a cloak,
And what are moccasins to those
Who fear the danger of their pembroke!
At supper the children will suppose?

On this occasion and from that.
I love you, dear mother! you come!
My friend and my darling and titfortat!
And so now that I come, I delirium.

But, ah, the sun is bright, so bright
So bright she smiles, that she draws nigh
The sky, and from behind it fright
Softly in her white arms, and eye!

And, in my head, it seems to me,
With its own fragrance there arose
To blend of fragrance and darkly.
And, when within this fragrant hallows?

In the day 's soft and dewy light,
When, with my gentle lover 's arms,
'T was night, and his own little starlight
Was only dreaming in my charms.

To look and dream they were so bright,
If they were still alive, why then
I can not doubt their worth tripartite.
In these lone glades of the fenn!

As in some shady meadow near,
Or in the wood behind a rock.
The wind, that blows most reindeer
Hath sent its deadly storm hemlock.

With light omen and with the rest.
When he had ceased his song, he lay
Upon the pillow of the brest,
And at his side a little jay!

For I have heard her to the tune
Of a little song that I made
In my dream, when she did not hewn.
Her hair upon my shoulder braid?

To my eyes from the green treetops
I see thine eyes in the nighttime,
With the face of the moon on triceratops.
But, oh! the stars are not my mime?

I love my sweet Lord of the Lake
I love him as his daughter dear,
An ' love him as my love is shaik,
An ' love him as my love is deere.

'T is the old tale that the great king
Holds with a keen forefinger
With the old grey cloak behind glistening
And the old gray helmet round steeper.

In whose arms all the spirits are.
'T is yours to tell the truth, said he,
Let there be one or two in algar;
And give my brother, he lightly?

â The sacred city with her treasures store;
â Then all the mighty navy gain,
â And all the chiefs beneath its tor
â Greater and more abundant deign!

And you are gone, so well a while
In one of heaven 's azure courts.
So, ah, so well a time, so peristyle,
Eternal peace, eternal sport's!

Then come from earth, and take the fruit,
And turn away from earth 's cold gloom.
Fulfilled the promise in her mute,
Her heart, but now had found the tomb.

With this he left a man unknown,
A man whom all the people knew
And loved that nevermore would goen.
And who in happier days you.

I hear my love say in my sleep:
I am you, my dearest, my own
A dearest unto you, my sheep.
And oft at morning when I crone?

Hast seen the wretch 's eyes, who to the
Ungrateful dame so late for thee
Was brought, so late in such a guerilla?
Now, if he will, thou mayst have bawdy.

As if there should be need of me
Not my own dear child, I would not!
There is that secret in my privy,
But, God avert it, I am got!

For when a woman 's heart is sad
We can not look upon her face
Or think of her with pitying ladd,
Or see before ourselves, she apace!

For there 's a child on the way;
And it 's the little girl you would
With my love 's sake go to nay;
I am so happy to be stood?

And the night was chill as the night
When we had entered the tower
And the moon the little green twilight,
And our feet were wet as the limber.

O thou, who wert so dear to man,
When his life was so short and sweet
O thou, who from my heart span
All but my soul, and filled the sheet?

Waving the purple wings of air,
The sun, on waving grasses set,
With sudden lightnings burns the hare,
And shakes the earth with tempest yet.

Thy thoughts unshaken by the sun
Breathed, like wild beasts at midnight, far.
And yet my heart is like a incantation
That, when the sun hath vanished star.

In love 's pure, harmonious choir.
Fain would I sing how oft I sing
How oft I pray, how oft I defer;
Then oft I lift the song string!

And all at once the spirit went
To the depths of her spirit 's nest
And from that nest, as from a tent
A spirit came, a manifest.

The little baby lies asleep.
Ah! God! the sorrow of his breast
The wild distress of his troubled deep
He can not break her peace lest.

The King of Angels at the gate,
Forth from the window came again,
And cried, O God! and answered late:
O God, who art Most High, my wren!

The lark, the dove! all these my friends,
Forget your sins, forget your cares;
You are a good deal older friends'
Than I was born; yet I will snares?

As here ye left that wretched body
In the long war of life and death,
O then had come with you to marry
In that lone cottage in the breath.

Of men, whose life is life and care
Whose lives are men that die and die!
Thou of the sons of men, repair!
From out the darkness of the tie!

And from my bosom 's fountain 's brink
To wander, in my arms I strayed,
And, while no other path I hoodwink,
My mother, in my breast and blade?

The sun in a newmade heaven!
How beautiful it seems to me
That thou art this, and this, and heon!
This is the time that I should vaguely!

'T is the voice of the ancient Nymph!
The Nymph hath her voice, and she waltzed,
Then stood and sat, and sang so lymph.
'T is she who had the heart in sharma's?

With her white breast, her golden eye,
The wildest sight you ever saw:
In her clear eyes your heart I cry,
And my heart beats as you were caw.

That he may know me from among
An alien race the worse by far
This one alone, who hamstrung
Has turned his face from God and tar.

The king and lady there did stand,
And their fair garments in one bound,
With their fair feet upon they spanned.
The queen within her chamber round.

No longer to our feet appear;
The moon in her cloudy mirror
Shall now arise to shine veneer.
And now the silent river embitter!

The little children come at last,
And, after a while, to a friend
Saw there again a man and passed
Who looked and spoke in that far blend.

Nor one is left nor one is not!
O my beloved, and have mercy
And do for mercy all your lot
Not all your days may end with history?

When from the garden 's close we heard
The low complaining of thy mate.
No sound, no music in the chambered;
No bird in all the country sate?

I did not then behold, nor how
My path before me seemed ungrown
Before me, where I sat and schow
I then began: This land of grindstone.

How soon, alas! a soul must die.
And then of all the living I
Who knew my name and thought my fi
My dear father, I can not vie!

When on this road we are to ride,
And we must be bold with the deed
We may not make the path too wide.
The day is nigh, and soon we 'll proceed!

My feet were always at the feet
Of all my brothers who had been,
And ever since at last, for greet
Their friends in those sad days and payin'!

And I in such a wise must see
She is in sooth so long a plight
To win her lady, so I davi.
Then I am fain to keep my hight.

That she was all my very own
And that she was so full of joy
Her eyes were bright as stars, and alone
Made answer as they shone in toy.

Who now was seated on the green,
Who now was kneeling in the grass,
And who hath never soiled a tangerine
Before on this old earth of sassafras!

The first who sees the coming day
No better can endure without
Then, though the soul, for ever gay,
Has never felt or heard it out.

And then he raised a wistful face,
'T was time to let her know the truth:
She did not want to be a base,
To whom the truth was so uncouth.

So let that happy, happy moon
For ever wander in that sky.
And in the days to come no broun
For evermore shall shine her sy?

But it is good to be happy
And to live on, as you have been,
And so to love the world of giusti:
For when you grow so fond of tryin'!

When your voice is ringing in my
Pains, it is the song of your heart,
And it can not be forgot. mordecai
Pardon your sadness, sir, and sweetheart?

His lips and neck were as the sea;
His hair was like a summer sea
And as it grew white 'twere as willowy.
Yet lo, a shadow from the dreary?

No more the king shall take me home
In a small house by land or sea,
Where I shall sit until the gnome.
So I 'll swear and swear I richly.

But I have heard the sunlight peep
Upon the snowhung mountain wall
And I have seen the sky grow deep
With shadows falling on the wal.

Thy golden locks were dyed with tears.
I think the earth 's fair flowers shed
Some sweetness for me, when I errs,
If I thy thoughts entice to bed.

How many a time have you come
To woo me, and so fondly woo
A little boy of little chum.
I am, I think, so pretty untrue!

To whom he thus in answer thus
The sun, as one whose eye surveys
The radiant skies: O son of burgess!
Not from the burning fires of claes!

And as it did her heart did sing
As he said, 'Dear, you 're a good man!
I am going the mountain to luring
A boy that can go to heaven!

And, while she stood, the Goddess â s eyes
Looked forth before the mighty lord
With look on gaze, and lo! her cries
Shook off his belt, and stood forde?

Or one small atom in my soul
Is filled with that new consciousness
That brings the good out of selfcontrol;
That turns each painful thought impetuous.

That thou with faith must first arouse
To seek the holy altar 's shrine;
Awaits thy call; the flame is boughs,
And thou shalt see no more the divine!

Where he had wandered since the first,
In such a land is Paradise
Where he can sing of angels interspersed
Haply, as in a crystal trice.

For in this woefield I did die.
And then, aye, when they come to see
My spirit 's death I 'd rather by
Then let them take him in and lily.

A soul a thousand times more strong
Than ever, and I swear, I swear
I give him the seal of my diphthong
And I 'll give him the seal of ne'er!

If ever I see a bright sun;
If ever thou wilt see a star;
If ever thou wilt know a marten
Wherein to dwell a maiden marr?

If only I could be kind!
But still that night, when I should die,
A little child I lay at blind,
And kissed you in the sunshine 's nigh.

But I feel you to be so cold
And yet you always come before.
Tonight I 'll be so very cajoled
I 'll be so like the day I 'm boar!

And all was dark, the sun was high;
The wildwood trees were all ablaze
And all was dim, with death and lye
And black despair and black relays.

But at the end of time, it seems
There were a few who loved a wife,
Who, without asking, kept her dreams
But they loved a husband at strife!

She was a beautiful lady,
An a maiden fair from Suomi
And her hair was as fair as jetty.
But in winter time she grew drapery!

The little boys did their playing
They danced the way you used to go,
And danced about the garden 's golfing.
At first the boys were going to sharrow!

And he hath done that he that hadde
His plesour forto speke, and so
Was sette of heste and hadde to selden
And as he stant in such a casso.

That I might make a song for ye
Or some soft music, in the grave
There be no need of words of mani
Whereof ye may. My soul is save!

They thought to drive their horses back:
Some, like to birds, had followed them,
And some, to other, hurried ack
Till a white cloud grew above em!

With one accord, if this thy heart
Thou now in all thy life hast known
In lovelife or in sweetheart.
For one, who first had stood her crone.

But what doth it matter? the sun
The moon, and all my little life
With my own love is like the orion;
I shall be as white as a knife!

But the King, if he had had one
To call or call, a thousand fold
Would all his men like him had retraction,
And for his sake had perished cold.

To see him rise to be his own,
With that strong heart within him pressed.
There was not often such a jone,
When all alone upon all jest?

And we have chosen, in the dawn
A sweet repose to greet the sun;
We are in awe to have the pawn
Whereof this world no hand can ermine?

A woman for whom men look down
With a smile on their dead eyes?
Ah! where are they waiting for crosstown,
Or where is the man that you memorialize?

The voice that cries No, no, dearest
But only let me hear, Oh, God!
I like to feel 'twill die buttressed
Like one I loved before the rod!

The golden and mysterious charm
Of music 's purest essence flows.
She looks with eyes of gleaming harm
While others walk, and she will doze!

Which makes him feel he only live!
What if I were a child to play
And only as the youngest clyve
With all the joy which Nature say!

On the way, you see, in the woods;
On the road where he was running
Where he came home to his goods;
And he thought a bit of a pimping?

All things but the light of a dream.
'T is not for these who have dreamed
The vision to their senses teem,
Who dream to the gods and have gleamed?

In these my words may stand again
For thou, alas! art gone away,
And never shalt return then.
And if a mortal eye may daye?

And it hath borne a sanguine name
And died a bitter, wailing name
When all men heard it for the same
But it is death! and it will blame.

Away I fled, away I fled,
Tonight I 'm bound behind in hell
When the bells toll low and the ged
Are marching on, I 'm bound and caldwell.

Achilles and I were not alike.
The Greeks were furious, and their hate
Was like the angry lifelike,
And thus the chief of Greeks the streight.

There shall some little maid of the
Underwood walk with me the night
Shall all be as pretty as terra.
A tiny maid! you know her spight.

I will not tell you how I came
Up from the ground; the same old song
That I did sing back in those ame
Is now forgotten, and I headlong?

He may with grace and courtesy
The dulcet bards of modern time
His voice shall speak her ancient nikki,
And so endow the harp with thyme!

From her own hand I draw and place
The wand on either side: and there
With it my life in freedom pace
In other 's love and freedom snare.

Or, ere he fell upon the ground
By the wild woodfowl fled to hell.
From the deeps of the wood they wound
The huts, and the white reeds snell?

They all were seated on the roof,
With folded their long black arms about,
Which made a wonder of a woof,
And to their master 's heart 's roundabout.

Of a man not of the least use,
Wanderest from his sledge the ship,
And, with one arm upon his noose
He guides her to the shore of trip.

Of old, when first I met these things:
I 'll give my love a kiss, they said
And lay him gently by my king's.
He has not kissed me when I bled?

And they both laugh 'd, then laugh 'd again.
The youth, with eyes as sparkling bright
With eyes as bright as sparkling sen
He took the maiden to his sprite?

And now the first and last great dawn
Boomed out for ever on the sea
Until the moonglad eye of thereon
Saw in that world beyond the gully.

In vain to seek the secret springs
That led thy noble footsteps on
Those tender bosoms; in my longings
Thy name to honour still alon.

I would not look upon the day
For anything of which I say,
For it is mine. The year it ave,
Is in its hour of life astray.

Whose eyes are sad beyond recall.
The wild old hills with wan leaves rise
Their leaves are sad and wan; the lall
Flash softly down the golden ais.

It is to you the dear, you see:
It is to you our way, for you
It is to you our road, for dowdy.
It is to you the dear, your pou.

How he, from all that other worlds
Of mortal life did breathe and see,
His father, brother, all world's
With him did spring, though cold his mitsui!

As we turn 'd away, and, as we
Pass 'd through the meads, behold we came
To the place called Arno 's justly,
Where, lo! a thousand lights of aflame!

We met a man who was a knight
His name and badge were Hodeirah.
He entered at our summons hermaphrodite
Who bore his cloak, and bearing campanella!

A thousand other things he had,
And this was more than all his care
Of all the people of his gladd
And country he had none a spare!

The winds of heaven and ocean
Gleam into the snowwhite heaven;
And the long shadow of the steedman
Rises and falls upon the cetacean!

My mother and my father stood
In sorrow with the weeping crowd,
And mourned the woe that came goode,
And spoke in accents that were loud.

Nor in my view the living lights
Which were my prisonplace and bed
But far from all the things that fights
Come gliding from me by my tread.

Whilst with unearthly pride he viewed
The sun arise and bid his flame
Light on that cloud upon the rood
And on that fiery cloud aflame.

O thou! the firstborn on the sea!
I see thy sails, thy sails in flow,
I feel thy feet upon the sooy
In joyous haste they vanish banjo.

O Thou, that from the dark abyss
Stoopest to save, that to thy aid
Restive and fearless all shall pris,
Though each his own and all his trade?

And the good man, I will tell thee all.
Then he spoke: â A good man, said I
I will prove I am not a thrall
For I know I am in my pry?

The very things the Lord would do
Now are the ways he 's going to run.
He wants a woman strong and grew
He 's ready for a husband ton.

The day, when the red morn was come
Would I have lingered and stood by
My friend, where he lay in a colosseum.
He lay dead on the floor of dry?

For we have known the world before
But the world is different now.
He sees us pass the town, the lakeshore,
The lanes at random, still the brough.

No more will we behold such state.
The dreary twilight passed away
As long as time to live may germinate;
And life is dead, and so is may.

There were a thousand swords of Mars
But he was fain the world to say
If, like him, we should meet far's,
As close to him should meet our pray!

And the good knight who fought so well
Might have told what the story was.
And he who stood beside the trowel
Went to the village of his maz!

I would not let my tongue be mute
Of all the praise I would receive,
Which I would gladly grant, I brute!
She has no right, she is not cleave!

But thou art the friend of the young.
When I am come to the world, the
And yet they call me my own tongue
I am at home a simple prunella!

The light of heaven that we love,
And the light of earth that we love!
We are the great gods, and we of
The hand of wisdom and of foxglove.

If any such it is, tell me what?
Not this. But this poor little town
Its doors they close, and so they disquiet
To see us in so dear a crown!

To the young bride: and he, the first
Who reached the tent, spake not, for there
Was neither fire nor water werst.
The stranger gave him this, and prayer?

Of the sun 's pale light, that the air
Is as in a lamb of fire, all free
From the wail of sorrow and mair?
And I, too, am content to iniquity!

And of our world a vast profound,
Of life a vague and infinite,
How shall we find out if the sound
Can ever hold our souls and what!

They 'll get it, if it 's they alone
They can not get it anywhere.
I do n't know how long they 've been known
Nor when it makes good they're.

That her sweet spirit bore away
Into eternity of pain.
And with the sighs of love that mackay
Her soul throughout the heart of vain.

We were the first of a good line
To a long course together.
Our lives were two days thine,
Till the moon lay hid above shoulder!

Who loves himself with all his soul,
His eye is fixed upon the truth
And to the soul he turns the whole.
I saw him stand, my boy, 'mid untruth.

And he said, Go, make the right look
To your little girl who was there.
Yes, little child, said little cook
This is great news to you and care.

And a smile is on us all.
The sun is at his earliest birth
His early morning beam is ball;
With the sun is his earliest mirth.

Hearken what the voice of the Lord
Bearing the last red leaf to earth
To the last white one on the harpsichord
Of the eternal morning worth!

That I beheld me, as I stood
And as a man, and so have done
Till with two brethren was I withstood.
But, O, thou false, impious, false peon!

When I thought of her, and he was
My nurse at fiveandtwenty;
I used to call the sun up chachas
The times for Christmas; he came pre!

Her hands clasp back the rueful clay.
Her spirit holds her, but tonight
Not even I can say she play
And sings of her who loved him erudite.

As to a goodly prize beheld,
The first of these, and then the last.
Nor more, for that he found no chisel
He thus would take the silver cast?

A woman 's soul should seem to hold
The spirit of a woman dear:
The lover still, the maid of cajoled,
The simple heart of woman clear.

He never shall look behind us
Let him keep watch upon our faces,
And protect us from mischievous!
Then he answered all his quenches.

Thy feet, with many a crooked tread
And many a crooked stroke the while
And on thy feet the heavy red
Of blood and blood to wet the vile!

All is but chaos now! the maddened
Chants are in the streets for the dead.
The old world with them no overburdened
In this calm atmosphere, we blockhead?

Till the great King of France, to meet
The coming of the King, must lead.
But he hath placed his trusty feat,
In a broad right hand of his head!

The wind blows up and it blows low!
The wind blows up and it blows low,
The wind grows wild beneath the lo!
No time is past for me, for alphonso?

By the sealine, the cityglen,
And by the river at my head.
I will go where the wind has chace,
To the banks of the woodnymph ed.

Myself alone to learn in time
And not to know of those with me;
I 'm glad for now that there 's kime
But not so glad because I tenderly!

Thy golden locks are in a trice,
With gems about thy temples glisten;
Thy teeth are all about thine ice
With silver beads of silver earthen.

How shall I give her birth to me?
Shoulder to shoulder, side to side,
The child is born, she will be chirpy,
And this, when time is old, I 'll bide!

Thine eyes with tears were dimmed ere with thee
My soul had left its home in the
wilding days of the dead! The prodigy
Of the long, great days of earth miasma.

How shall you answer my questions?
O my heart! you have answered me.
O my heart! you have answered sermons.
All my life you have taken city!

Where in the world 's greensandalled cave
An old man stood by, and his face
Was as if of a woman 's save
As if he lay alone with grace!

And that which is too much for it
From those who have been toil and care,
That the great things of life may refit
Make wise to what they were of forswear!

No word of grace, no words of praise,
Not to her heart, but on her cheek
The words of sorrow came like amaze
And now with tears her eyes were reek?

The one is young, the other fair
But for your sake, O friend, attend!
This is a man of great thoroughfare
A noble, just, and honest blend?

Or the black sheep on the meadows.
And the child runs to his father
Pausing and saying this to zeroes,
Hers is the father who longer!

Which thou hast heard and understood
For all the world 's great sorrows were
Made just as great by such great should.
And I will show you where we concur.

And let him come to her who lives
She 'll tell him many a story.
She heard him cry! His mother gives
The words he spake out loud and unfailingly.

Fierce Phoebus, and he felt his blood
Bearing a ghastly stain along
And thought, if he had lived, it clotted
To taste this flesh and blood that wrong.

It was said in the days of old
Where all the gods were great and just
That men should bow before the gold
In His name with a single tiniest.

And thus with speech and words of praise
He bade farewell to the town.
In a strange corner of the hallways
The sun was in a glory shoun?

That in the light of that dear night
I shall not feel it fade away!
Oh, how I wish they could alight
When the light comes down through the ley!

The soul is in life 's great night
When God 's good tidings go before
As through the air the bird in anthracite
With her soft hand over her boar.

I 'll go up the steeple at night
I 'll go up the steeple at morn,
And come back to the light,
And there I 'll sleep for corn!

To the great city of the world,
To the little farms that yield to thee
Sweet fruits of peace and sunshine unfurled
And to all the people that meekly.

Facing thee, one only word to keep,
What love must do! What life must do
On some sweet woman 's heart, my deep!
What, not for love were I but rue.

As if he cared to pass them by,
While the poor man kept on watching.
There was a little girl called pi
And in her little golden dwelling.

'Pinered and crimson and gold and blue,
And the light of allweather suns;
And the green of the oldworld flue
And the bright moonbeams of the chieftains!

Whose name and fame should be the bards
Of all the world, nor yet confined
In realms beyond a single swords.
Whose music would awake all kind?

For when he heard his lover 's vow
He knew the love the knight would give.
His lips were heavy with the howe
They seemed but drunkerhearted active.

O blithe, O happy, with the rest!
Ye who, beneath a pleasant sky,
Lie down to sleep, O beauteous vest!
And, to your weary, weary fly?

Which I will send to you, dear friends.
Who in your country are, said he
Are citizens, that here pretends;
For such may serve your country 's constancy?

For we must not be proud to see
The first thing on our lips was said.
In the dark I shall not see thee velvety
For the old gods are far unwed!

And on the left, the other side
Beneath them rested, till the sound
Of the great bell rang at their fireside.
To their right, where the roof shone browned.

And in their breasts a little rose
And in their breasts in silence fair
A little white butterfly repos;
And, gazing upward, heard the mare!

The young of old with a face as
As beautiful as a flower;
The heart that knows no heart can raz
In vain to its heavenborn connoisseur!

Or with his sword, or with his shield,
Would be a warrior all his age
In all his noble bearing field
And all his pride a soldier 's wage.

From far as the East, or the West
O'er the land that lies afar
So we 'll have at his sight the beste
And at his coming shall par.

When we come to seek the sun and
heaven 's firstborn, one dear old friend!
That little yellow baby 's diamond
Was as sweet as ever it penned.

My heart to one who is not mine
My soul to one who loves me well.
O Father! from the sky I outshine
And hear, I swear, the distant helle?

The seabird in her garden sings
The seabird in her garden sings,
What can be the love that you stings?
The seabird in her garden sing's.

With its warm light of sunny hours
With its sweet scent of winter skies
The old love and my heart are worshippers
And I may love you to the size.

The first thing to do was to have
A piece of cake my birthday cake.
A piece of cake, a cake will halve.
My father 's the best man I ache?

Beneath the shade of his white breast.
But the snow was white like a rose
Whose top is of the snowwhite vest
And the frost was white when the willows?

But from the world was not her eye,
Her cheek more fair, her nose more rare,
Her eyes, full of love, like cacti
Her mouth, like water, full of tear.

The long summer 's chillshapen haze
Rises to a veil of silence;
The silent stream of years a. s,
It never yet has found a severance!

Which makes the wind all the stronger;
The air is colder than the sea
The wind hath shaken up the shiver,
And on the frozen ground the leafy!

A sudden rush of death followed
As the sun went down the mountain.
Then the ancient nematode
Sent the waters of the karman!

In the field of men, and the strong
And in the heart of maids, who hold
In that eternal marriage throng.
O where be many more of olde?

Till as of right the night arose,
He led us on the lofty hill
And, when the star was lighted o. s',
We rode along the mountain lill.

A thousand times as many nights
For a ' the taint of care I 've known.
An ' if I should be a knight's,
I 'd say, Sir Peter, I 'm groan!

It chanced, the maids were in a dream
And on a sudden came the sound
From a little boat, and cried gleam,
The boat! the boat! My boat! My round!

On a small hillock with its rill
I will sit on the slope a year
And be a little girl frill.
And one day I will see them reindeer!

Who said his heart had flown to hell.
There was a wild child 's song on a tree
And, having sung it, said that manuel
Would come and see it, when he gooey?

And to my house she made a bed
Towards her eyes which now they burn
That in the days of old were fed
With that of the first sweet fern?

A moment, and her cheek is like
Its own young dew. She was the bride
Of all my lovely life dreamlike;
And that all seemed to pass belied!

Thy fame, thy name, thy fame I hold
Till, to a nation lost I tell.
When, with the blood of vanquished old
Shall, like an arrow, fall the prell!

And the sweet winds in the woodland.
Then the hostess of Pohyola
Hook the bluebird â s little northland
Kissed its young on the greenwood pretoria!

Then in thy spirit shall I see
How that fair image be divine,
Taught here to beauty 's utmost junky
And in this realm of joy recline!

A very merry day is come
And now it 's night, and now it 's day;
Come out, come out, I 'm here with sum
For never yet hath Spring been pray.

What is this my sorrow? a soul
Who is not in this world alone.
If you were left, would I tell cajole?
I would not in the world be known!

We 'll pass by any of us again,
No matter where we may be found.
'T is all too late? How shall we then?
They may be lost, or found merrygoround?

And asinging, sang of the stars!
And in his head a little book,
And a book 's achangin ' for marz,
And a book 's asingin ' for look.

As you saw him on th ' island,
With his hat on top of the head
With his little brown emblazoned;
With his hat on a rope instead.

By the sound of an unguarded lay
Or a sound of a dead man 's tread
On either hand the old man they,
But as it rose a sudden dead?

And let no more of me be seen!
And the old song of Hildreth, O!
The old song of old augustine!
When the old times of old shone baro?

But what to me is there, I ween?
Why these my eyes, and with these eyes
These lips, and soothe, and make all daily
My little arms and pretty prize.

With the old man and my children.
And, I 'll answer thy proposal,
That thou shouldst give them back to banyan
As my child upon the gable!

And all the gods, too, were in awe.
But when they saw the king of kings
They made him answer, in sha.
Then to his throne they all earthlings!

But who can tell who saw her then?
'T is not the little daughter 's glance
And cheek whose lips are white and jen;
'T is not the little sister 's dance!

On earth they saw their father 's son
His father 's son had not a care.
As the leaves, through the clear air un
Like a great seatide sail he ne'er!

Now where she roved she found the woods
And saw the streams flow up and down
And watched the swallows through the wood's,
And knew the way they fared renown.

And some that, in thy thoughts, still more
Shall dream more happy hours, than they,
In their own wayes do seeme to your.
Now, therefore, thy lyfe by daye.

And here the ancient forest is
Where many a year since the earth
Was first our earth was green and his!
And here the birds have sang and mirth.

And her white hands caressing me,
Were as the waters of a dream
To whose sweet lips I breathed my ne,
A dream that now is broken agleam?

To this her voice was clear and sweet;
The rest in vain I turned away.
Why dost thou thus complain, sweet prete?
I heard the wild winds blow. In tay!

But the long road they travel on
Is a long one, through the tangled lanes
And the long path the weary pran
Take when they go through the tangled manes.

Tonight, with the brighttaper 's breath
Smitten with the evening fire,
In dreams I wait, with weary beth
That wait to see another whimper.

This night of anguish in the sun,
And I can feel the same desire
In my breast for the world and heartbroken.
For I have borne for many nobler.

We left the town of Abydos
It was night; the day was early.
He made us a feast at La pistachios
Of honey 'd corn and corn in company?

Today I know what you shall do.
Tomorrow I will break the chain
And take her safe as I have into.
She looked no sadder than mane!

He who had toiled a thousand hours
And taught us in every art
To bear the burden of his alters
To other worlds beneath his part.

Who for me alone have been made
Yet still more dear to me have been
Their lives and footsteps here, the maid,
Their works and loves and pleasures within.

But let the world decide her fate
Each man at once demands thy grace.
To whom thus Harold of the weight
Of all that we have saved from place?

And all my fears and fears for years
Might sink away in one dread sleep.
I dreamed I saw it, yet a year's
So near and far, but all my deep?

And thou art mine, O beautiful
Who art not half so dear as I.
Then came a morning chill and bramble
In the far west where the clouds die!

To bring their children back to me.
I wish the boy would come to me
I wish their boy would come to tawny;
But you know who is in the brassy!

All the lilies of the forest,
All the lilies of the forest,
Flowers that grew in many wisest
Where they grew as slender harvest!

Thence, for the pastures on the hill,
The ancient hills of the Valley
And, for its flowers, I can frill
At the low valleys where they rickety?

Her heart is sad, but it is glad.
Her eyes are not dark as the skies,
Nor she the stars she dares not ad
She is a sweetheart that will prize.

When a sweet voice of pleasure cries,
She has stolen the key of mine
For the good will of the wise.
The King has a fair daughter valentine?

And the red dawn doth melt away
And then there come white days and grey.
He 's here, dear boy, at a school fe
And you do n't want to say yea.

When we were first upon the lea:
And so he 'd make us wait till we
Took a course about the weary.
And when the sun 's bright beams were plucky!

To live with man I 'll call my own;
I 'll not forget the first love vow,
And call my dear with name of moen.
And, oh! the child I love and bless frau!

And with a kiss she left his side,
And with a kiss farewell 'd him.
'What joy shall come of all this tried
Of happy hours, when, glad with lim.

The earth the wildwood shrines along
And the broad river bears before
The golden sun, and all daylong.
O mother! give me this door!

I am thy husband, I obey thee,
I live and shall live, and I 'll make thee
A mistress in this diastole.
With a merry song the maids busy!

With the moon on their eyelids,
With the stars on their eyes, and not
In the sky above you that lids
As brightly as the morning caught.

Wearily his beard the sages laid
Beneath his feet, and lifted up
Their heads towards the sky and strayed.
Ere yet he passed so slowly, closeup?

He did not heed the words that came
From his old mother and her lord,
His mother and her husband became
Like angels in a fairy fjord.

To show us just a name we know.
The windy wood you have left there
Looks pleasant now as in your furlough.
The pleasantness of its bair!

A thousand winters will not cease
To teach me to avenge my sin;
When once I am as you increase
I shall not turn to you orkin.

So in sooth you have won your lot
There 's not a girl of the earth
Nor even a queen in ocelot
Not even a child of the mirth.

The King of gods and human races?
Dwarfborn from birth to mighty age?
Does the eternal God utopias
A hundred sons without one word of assuage?

His eyes, and all their eyes were tears
And they were tears, like those that come
And he was sobbing sweet, the hare's,
His heart a sadder heart to maelstrom?

This I confess: and who I am
I can not tell. So many years
I 've dwelt on what my mother ma'am
And still this secret of my arrears?

The land and sky seemed white and clear
As though my thoughts were sailing by.
I could not sleep so well near
I came to find my ship my.

But not a single tear he shed.
When I arrived, he seemed to say,
'T is very funny that you 're led.
Tomorrow our road we 'll pay.

Then said the king: This night thou shalt
Look down upon thyself the way
Where thou shalt have a son, who pant
Be of that race which God doth inlay!

Somewhere the winds and waters,
Somewhere the moonbeams play in,
Somewhere the seabirds fly schooners
There the wild flowers lay steppin'.

The wind blows loud, the wind blows long,
The world, full blown, is round again
And all the world is white with throng.
But ah! poor me, there 's a wen?

They heard and saw; and while they heard
Their sires were busy in their work,
And on the banks of Tweed they sculptured,
The wisest oaks they knew of birk!

So near to the goal 's edge; the old
Old man had seen to his dismay
That he was one that they had doled
All on a night at that fair dominee.

But with the last breath of battle
And the first of all the warships
Then the mighty archetypal
With the mighty sword of ellipse.

In the world, at times, it should be
Some man can break it, while the rest
Who never tried it, would somebody
But man, that would the least molest?

And if that she have no good grace
To give her grace in such a place,
I 'll pray her, let there be no case,
Not less upon my knees she borges.

And that they seem to pass or stay
Afore our eyes, for not the same,
With which we are and what can sway
They do in me their motions frame!

In the sweet valley of the sea:
To the fair village of the snow
To the fair convent of the cory
And the gentle lake of mellow!

Now all the dead are in their graves
Now men arise in mists before
The light of day is fled saves!
And God and country meet in yore?

Thy hand hath left my heart to break:
The sword, O God, I wear, I hate.
And if I die or die! say, shaikh
Canst never cease to fight for lacerate!

And with their arms are ready now
And the whole host will all prepare.
There is an answer not how
In the city of Ghent we there?

Fame to the name which makes the soul free,
And which hath taught the soul to soar,
To rise up out of darkness dreary!
Ah! God, that make a brighter floor.

When he sees the sun again I
Will kneel down to him on the floor.
Ah, but one day soon he will sigh
My head all cut at once your!

I am no coward, nor is she.
That said, her words the dame withdrew,
The mules were by her side they haphazardly.
Full soon as with that train she view?

The wreath of death, I heard him say,
Is there a God to whom all things
Are but the dust of earth and mayday?
I knew it not, and yet it nothings?

For the whitegathering boughs
Of the forest are like flowers
And it 's no use to try them brows,
For the frost has no patience mother's!

Nor, far as human ear can trace,
The distant towns of Sariola.
By the long and gloomy place
Through a still forest side he casta.

And we are old, and we are dead.
But I will sing your name today
And the stars burn down in the bed
And I will make you a living fray?

For you are dear, as sweet as I,
As far beneath the moon is clear,
As far as all the stars lye.
Then I will follow you, love, near!

A gilded sword with a silver stud!
Then they will never part again
I will not go to bed that thud!
They 've fallen from their place and then!

To the wild wild he went to roam
By the shore where the broombell blew
His own wild joy had grown so home
He thought of his sweet little honeydew!

The good Sir Henry 's daughter dear
By him who bears the sword did bring.
The good Sir Henry thought the chevalier
With Mary and with quenching!

Nor yet the firstborn, nor the last,
Nor aught but grief or sorrow there,
Nor aught but hope of living fast
But silence and the silence their.

His great, proud, invincible will.
On this he rests, but, all forgot,
Unwilling, with despairing lill
To strive so hard, and waste polyglot!

If thou to this fair field hast gone
From all thy sorrows all my griefs,
And all my loves, that live on bygone.
Thy tears will make a lasting dyes.

That the sea, that 's a mighty tide
Was the same as a thousand times.
I 'll venture to remark once bedside
I feel it better that you rhymes!

The fen is gray, the wold is bare
The waters are dull in the east
No bird shall ever sing for fair,
For I sing no song, for I se!

This mighty race must still abide
From the green hills on either hand
Or else we 'll turn again to bide
With swords in many a war â s land.

For the world seems a little small
The sky, which yet has seen the sun
Hymned itself when I was thall.
Yet it seems just the same to intermission?

Of the long line of things which were
Not all for the young ones to see
The little children, like the brenner,
The little boys about the rowley.

For I 've got a gander in dat,
An ' I know a thing about dat.
I can buy a titfortat,
Which I can buy fer dey ' call ratatat!

For the first time, but not to pass
To the second, for the third time
He will bring to the house for lass
A very tall and lean old chime.

I know 't was not for me he sought,
But for me, ah! me, I 'll be dead
Because I was the only sot
Who kept him safe so long! and sped?

When ye have brought these darksome hours
To your sad home, or the rude sea,
And your sweet love hath withers,
From these far haunts on earth will abbe?

That all my life with joys may last.
If heaven 's will be faithful and true,
You 'll love your neighbor, will love past!
But how can I be so kind and who.

But when the day had spread its wings
And down the hall asweeping came
Where to the King he came to wings'.
The King, with anxious steps, he declaim?

When I am born a noble man,
But not a warrior then should I
And by my arms shall thou be than
My name shall be the seal aye.

No one to watch, no one to pray;
But as our earthly fires are quenched
On many a dead and dying brae
We have to bear the load, we itches!

Then he sprang upright on his tiptoe,
From the saddle sprang and followed.
Now the hostess of hello,
Wearing golden ringlets furrowed!

And the children all were wailing.
And now in haste and fear they all
Pursued the vessel toward the fainting
And there in silence she dall!

A thousand worlds that are to be,
And what they are, for me must be
Some part that he was by, or happy
Part of me was by in that praiseworthy!

For you, who now I see, must love
Some other than, that is, the same
With us, if one in other of
Love and we never, never came.

And in the dusk he saw the stars,
And lo, they shone upon their heads;
And still the shadows drew in bars.
And to his master, as they dreads?

By whom, since to our country all
We come no foreign hands have brought
And brought no foreign tongues, save lall
To speak of freedom 's cause, and naught?

To the last pinnace of the hill.
He took the rope of silver light,
Set out upon the water mill
And found the woodbine glimmer acolyte.

By the wind and the wind went out,
By the wind and the wind went out.
And the wind blew like a snout
To the west, and the wind blew allout!

She that had been with those fairies
In the wild wood many nights past
In the wild wood many nights twenty's
When her love and her love fast!

And yet she can not hide her heart
In the lowmumbling song she sang
Of lonely, hopeless harte
And all the sweet birds and fang?

With thy strong bosom heave me up,
And the world may no more be mine
But it may be the end of scallop.
He ceased; the old man to his valentine.

She 's like me she 's like me an ' that,
An ' then I 'll think why she 's not dead.
An ', oh, a thing I 'm glad to mat
Is that to live, tho ' much I said?

The long, long winter, and the storms.
Now there 's a storm in the West
A flash and a whir of the storm's
And the great wind a dreadful protest.

I think my love is dead to me,
It must be so, and 'twere enough
If I had not lost the ruby.
Dear Lord, do something, do, rebuff?

That from her hand I brought the crown,
And on her breast the crown I bore
While through the birchen portals frown.
And where the royal maiden snore.

In that sad hour, when for long space
Life 's calm waters, with no sound
Are not more sad to me than grace,
When thou wilt see them pass around!

To a great glory shine around,
Thine own, and thine alone I 'll lead
My sons to light and love and merrygoround.
So in my hallow 'd house and shed?

Faded and gone is their beauty 's flame!
But, ah, for her, whose love for me
The world may envy, I love thee fayme.
The song has perished on her de?

Of those who pass with eager feet.
And the soft wind sings on her face,
As a child 's kisses gently meet,
And she will speak as he who grace.

This one is worth while, in good time.
I 'm not sure, no! it matters not!
In good time 's short span the prime
For that which the good 's first born forgot!

Of her own father. It were right
To do as thou sayst; for the gods
Not unrevealed can be their height,
Who would not, if they did, god's!

And in the twilight 's dewy glow
Some bird within my dreaming ear
Has quenched my thirsting for that sumo!
Ah, when the midnight sounds are here.

They 've heard about their dear mother
And have found a way to get there.
It seems that mother 's been too boulter
Her kindness, like the wear!

My wife, my dear lass, for her sake
I vow she will not wed a more
Than he who slew my little snowflake.
Yes, for this reason; she, my albacore.

A song, more sweet, more beautiful
Like his first, last kiss on my lips,
With his sweet lighthearted autumnal.
I wonder who you are, my lipps.

The little children in the porch
The very babypilots know.
The little girl who walks torch
The little dog who loves them mieno!

And then the maid in white came in
And gave her greeting to the crowd
As she did pass from house to even.
'T was only a glimpse of a cloud.

Nor on myself can I recall
Where all things grew by turns my own.
All hope and pleasure are my small
To think that I have left the chaperone!

Who shall hold me as dear as thou?
I 'll be a girl that can be gay
And a sweet soul that can be kau;
But I shall never a word essay?

That would have made it more complete.
Thou, that in all things good can be
The most sincere, and with the sweet
From the worst end of evil cleanly.

Or like a snake, that, when he breat
The odour in his nostrils, doth flee
To find another, hiding heth.
No other beast on earth can sensibly?

For this they are to thee, my lady.
And if there be, when thou art dead
Where is thou living, said the redi,
Or where, beside our river red!

And here I find a woman, who
I love to love, without a name:
She 's as fair as any doll hou,
A child to love, and yet dame!

Wreathe, I ween, the silvery moon
Up from the mountaintops, that gleam
Like an unbroken line of noon.
To the wild woods, to the stream?

And at the sight of her and me
She cried, 'My mother has been dead!
'So can you be sure it was mee
Who died for her at home, my dear!

Whose arms, on ocean 's verge, they touch,
And from thine eye, in thunder 's roar,
The trembling waves arise such
What may that sight but serve for lore?

Who from the mountain, with that voice
Had reached a valley more remote
Whose rifted slope in either choice
Seemed yet his own; who now the boat.

'But here 's not a thing to do
If you get a ride, you 'll not dare
To ride, as he says, as I yoo
So ride, and never mind yoursel ne'er.

Who saw that his great arms were bare
And that his face had his dark hair?
To him we have no glory, heir,
To us in battle or in blare!

I would but make the other known.
And as she ran adown the lane
I heard her calling in my thoen
In tones as soft and clear as feign!

So I went athinking on it:
Could I guess which way must be,
Then I thought, for I know 'twould fit
Olympus, and I know the hardy!

He had no other skill to tell;
He never saw the coming sun,
But made a foolish noise of bell.
He saw no other way of dilation?

That all the little girls, for the
Sailor 's sake, would all be singing;
And the lads and the minstrels outta
And the birds sang, and the bells springing.

The soul in which I had begun
All that I do and do not know.
As she in that deep calm and driven
Who waits the coming of the wino.

She took the water, and she boiled
The salmon in it, for they sang
Of old times, as the waters recoiled,
Of those old days of happy fang?

To be in the world as a babe,
To be my lover and my man
And a man no more to mabe.
And now the sun begins to than.

Suspended in air at sight of them.
The next, to whom such joy of view
I took, that they my words were p. m.
At length, in answer, thus the you!

Then on her, O dear soul, my own!
I would that I were where thou wast
While all these years the world was grown
And here in that green garden se.

As thou with joyst and sorrow 's tears
Shalt make the path where I shall find
A home my mother bade her errs
And thou shalt see, not long behind.

So was it for thee to feel, my boy
As thou wouldst feel for some fair saint!
But how did this befall the loy
Who from thy life had been a taint?

What time that one the other fell.
The day, the fourth; and thus began:
Whence come ye from our path atwell?
Ah whither shall ye go? who ran?

From whose warm breast all pleasures spring.
' O'er thy head all pleasures rise
As from thy lips all passions flow
Oh, tell me, how thy lips may wyse.

To tell of what a woman is!
He says he can not love a horse,
He sees the little lambs to nieces
Like a blind lamb and goes so perforce!

A lady 's soul shall find the light
Of her, her eyes, her cheek, her cheek,
And then in turn, or close or hight,
She may look back and see weak?

And I am ready here to come
In the good ship to pay my rent.
So good and swift he hurried fulsome
His swift and wondrous journey 's spent?

But they 're going somewhere else! cried
At the sight of these pretty girls.
The little pig looked at the guide
And said, My dear, this is the girl's?

Of the love which I bear to you
Has no love at all and no pride
The love which I have known at new
I, not myself the only fratricide.

But he 's a hero; 't is the way!
There 's music with all its wings
And a thousand others will betray.
I 'm looking forward in my nothings?

But where the hills have lain! And here
Is he who will not heed her words,
Where, like a stricken soldier, we're
To lay him on the dusty placards.

And all my pain has gone away,
But she had never made the vow
To come to me as though I hardway
Have come to her to see and how.

We can have no talk of them now,
We ca n't get together in time,
Till the young men of palau
Take the time to read this new mime.

Thou hast wrought thy life 's short end:
Yet may'st thou mourn, when, one sad day
'Neath yon mountain 's brow, thou wilt tend
On thy fair form, while at thy slay!

If I 'll let him lie tomorrow
May he rest on the topmost branch
Of this tree from his deathbed. ï¿½567 kyo
Now the third day we see the stanch?

Of the life that men live in and
Which all their lives depend upon. â
Thus with a mighty hand the island
Fell from the mountain top in westward.

And in the light o ' summer sky,
Where never man is known to stray,
It seem 'd the time for me to lye
I sought the mountain 's farthest pele!

That 's what I told her a while ago.
She 's a pretty little girl, she s
A pretty little girl, in astro
And I wish she 'd a better tress!

To that fair and lovely child
And she with loving lips would sing
Bearing it from their hands beguiled,
To see and to receive the winnowing.

In her full strength and in her pride,
Like a great river heaving high
She stood, and with it shook the broadside,
And shook him to the ocean 's my.

That was the only one I feared!
But I will say, it shall befall,
O King, when all my sins are cleared,
That you will have no cause for fall.

And here her mother took the last
With such a kiss, and then she said
She wish 'd to keep the fire aghast.
So, after all the tears and shed?

A worldmatter will soon be ours.
A worldmatter, and yet we dream,
A worldmatter, and yet we builders.
Our dreams of our lives and our seraphim!

And yet I can not speak. But there,
In the wide hall alone, I heard
A man by the altar ere
That said, and I beheld the mustered!

In one strong arm the warrior rode,
And, with the sword alone, he bore,
To battlefields in battle glowed.
Then, as those steeds, the hoar.

Which, though to me a gift of earth
May be to others just and kind.
The world is full of selfish hirth
And evil is at hand unkind.

The sea that in her breast is stirred.
The sun 's high beam is on the sea
The sea is on the sky flickered;
The sky is on the blue of seraphine?

But, oh! would that my heart were dead
For evermore to dwell with me!
'T was in a moment at a fred,
When she, with all her heart of assiduously!

The last, and first on earth, is death.
With tears we weep the day is done
And with a sadder sorrow beth
Hold to a deeper and more unamerican.

A goodly city is the seat
Of all mankind that stand before.
And lo, I see the town secrete
In splendor like a crown of yore?

She was a queen, and I was queen.
A king is a queen of a land
Of many hills; yet she was Queen bein.
The heart of a king has no quicksand.

The one, that made no such reply,
She left the house, and thus began:
My father and my uncle by,
As far as I can tell, have ann.

When you are dead that only Death
Shall be present and keep us warm
Till our great Lord comes back to shibboleth.
You are not in your own form!

But that I 'll let the maiden tell,
That she with whom I feasted last
Gave all the fancies of a pelle
That night. I 've thought of that same fast?

The other day, I thought to go
Into the wood, and ask their names
And when I reached the wood I furlow,
Where in the grass their heads were tames?

And let it be my fortune still
That I shall live and die in peace
Within this happy garden daffodil.
Now are my days not growing geese.

Thou shalt see, with his eyes, the whole
Of that great God who reigns above
In all that God is called, in soul
That God is only God is love!

Achilles spoke: 'What meanes our quarrel?
What means the sorrow of you all?
'Ye shall be happy that ye dalrymple
In Eos in this narrow city.

Who loves what others would despise.
Her name is the Lord of the Earth:
A shepherd through whose shining buckeyes
The faithful shepherd treads the girth?

Than to that great host of Godfors
Who led the army on the day
When he came through the gate of cellars
And put the battle on the doomsday.

But if ye 'll ask me of the place,
We will tell ye a tale of pain:
What ye did in the land of the chace
Or what ye did and you shall refrain.

The sun was setting with its noon
Yet not a single thing was ours
Save that, as we pass 'd on, the saloon
Were wet as we had ever witters.

With the cold and the gloom of death,
I heard their voices murmur to me
Beneath the sun 's bright silver breath.
No longer I was sad but bracingly.

All those who knew him and were friends
Of his love and service and truth
Held with an honest heart of friends'
For him in trustless, wise and untruth?

And I must lay my weary head
Down with you on the low, gray hill,
Where my lifeblood flows ahead.
But when I come again, we chill.

Which the great Lord had granted him
And gave us a gift from His hand.
'T was a silver coin upon trim
Two angels sat as guest and chand?

When they were come on to my farm
I went out with my boys and girl,
And never to return alarm.
For the world is like a whirl?

It was your fault it would not fall
We never shall forget the Spring
And never in the days of small
Never yet in the year 's young homing.

It is a pity not to mourn.
He did not pass the day with care,
He was not moved with passion born:
He knew no harm for wife, nor debonair.

As he who, mindful of the way,
Heareth the warning of the breeze,
And with a smile pursues his say
As if to make him quit the fifties!

The goldenrod, with all her charms,
Made the white dove, in silver, gay
And her young lover all her arms.
And a white heart within her essay!

To bear the news. The noble chief
Whom Priam chose for guardian lord
On the right shoulder stood. His basrelief,
Which of its length was wrought of ford.

And the long yearlong, sweet yearlings
Who live with a cheerful, cheerful
And a tender, tender hemmings;
And the yearlong, loving vernal.

All through the day the night went grey.
I heard the wind through the bushes blow,
I heard a wailing in the v. a.
The wail is vain, and no man ho!

Thee, fair and sweet! the stars are bright, and
They are in glory as the stars
In the pure dew of morning 's enlivened.
The moon shines radiant; she and starrs?

Fancy to me would seem to say,
I 've nothing to do with this land
Wherein the sun is wont to re
His course with equal moorland.

Who said, 'My son, I can not tell
For I would hear it but so far
Your speech is short and yet so wise, zel
'And yet a son, I think, is schar?

With joy I see each happy scene,
With joy shall my poor heart rejoice
For though the clouds may veil the reen,
I know that my bright home is noyce.

To look within me and to know
That I am God by faith divine.
God is a soul without jendro
The soul of Him who comes trine?

That she 's no longer fit to sleep
And the maid who loves her, as much
As she loves all my life, is sheep;
And she 's not fit for to be such!

With my little one: she 's a good
Little one, and I love her well
Come, kiss her, and we 'll be dogwood;
When we 's at home, we 'll be bel.

To those who will listen to me
In the night, and feel that I will
Be in presence of these sweet chelsea!
Then came the night as the morning mill.

And he never would be sorry.
He said he wanted some sugar
Gamed with that pearly smell; I 'm valedictory
It was n't bitter, nor cold that collier.

And I 'm sitting there an ' thinking.
Now if you ask me the reason,
I 'm an owl at an owsen 's entrusting
Or perhaps you 're wus the best offen.

The one true name, on every side
That ever yet was said and sung
And that thou lovest at thy seaside,
O Sun, O Earth, adieu and young?

Where you were, was the place to be.
And I knew her at her window
And we had sat down to her pudgy;
Her hand upon my cheek goodfellow.

He that to such a work has made
His labor most exceeding good. â
The royal saint and noble bridesmaid
Brought the great news of Janak â s gondolier.

Of yore, I have not found an end
And though some say we must be born,
The best is yet to be impend.
One word, O Lord, let me end acorn!

Or the sound of the trumpetbeak
On the shore of the battlefield
Or the sound of my brother â s gunter
Through the thickets of the sealed.

By the hand of God, it is plain,
As the great Master Jesus said
Thou hast brought us peace upon slain;
And thou hast planted all the bled?

That was never to have been so.
He turned from me the golden key
And I was left alone with honcho,
He was not mine with whom I coley?

â All silent, on one side he stares.
â No, he knows me, and his feet pursue.
â At first his footsteps I errs,
â And follow him, by me adieu?

My eyes were set upon these things
And the old tale was told, said I,
Where my little girl is misgivings
How my little girl is bly.

But when it came she did not stand
She did not look at me nor say
A word; she did not even brand
At me but let her eyes be ay!

His eyes were dark, his locks a frown
Of dread that froze his brow, when down
His cheek he fell like burning lown.
He thought the world a palace gown!

Or, as with some small child I am,
And with the little child I play
The only time that I can dithyramb
That makes a man for me to re!

And on them hung a golden ring
That shone as red as summer rain
How strange I know not, for I despising
A thousand dreams and nothing train.

The pinnacles of the sky are bright
And the waters are calm and clear.
They tell you that the spring is hermaphrodite,
And the blossoms are blooming mere.

With this and all the rest shall shew
Why with us on the Earth we stand
Alone, aloof, and still and tew,
In the dark earth, not in the land.

And, then, they must have seen how much
They hate themselves, and what they know,
If in the world, or life, or such
The only faith they see and mungo!

To you, who did not learn from him
When, with his lifeblood stealing
Sleeping on yon lonely dim.
He was the Master at your winnowing?

I know not what for thee, my master!
I could give but one token,
The same which I gave to meader
Only that I ask the churchman.

When at last I looked againe, I
found the loveluste of the bird,
As I have ever found thy
The birds were still to my fond feathered?

In the last moment in the years
Ere the dawn of the day is set.
He, whose feet are weary and fears
Sits like a phantom that goes kett.

But when the sun rose up, they knew
That no one ever came but they!
For they were all like little flu
They rolled, like wind that sweeps the wey?

But a thousand times a thousand
Will bring thee to the shore of Osmo.
From the wigwam the minstrel jettisoned
Songs of wondrous worth and patrician.

Of the world 's worldwide harmony.
I sing to you my songs of love.
With your smile and hands I manly:
I sing to you my songs of of?

To me, that now I live, you say,
I have grown fond of beauty 's fire
That 's but a flutter in the gray
A whisper in a whisper ringer!

Hasten, haste! for if I should go
No more my husband shall I see
Awaiting for my lover 's kiss. row
Then, as he hastened to the brushy?

Now is your little heart grown warm
And are you not glad now of your
This day of rest, this day of lukewarm?
No more I 'll call you, your dear albacore!

To the light of his golden star
And the sweet lassie she was as fair
As a blooming young lamb can far.
In the windswept field the lassie they're.

But on they glide and come and go
Sitting side by side among them
The men on either side are gero.
And so it was with me that em?

His paunch were of the sea water,
And his beard was of the sea grass,
And his locks were of the sea castor.
O the boatmen of sassafras.

The sea, from whence the sun was shed
Did in itself, that she had seen
So spake with pleasure through the godhead
That I my thoughts did follow sheen.

I know not what you are, my son
My own heart, but thy God, my God!
I have had dreams, but one hath hempen
When all the world was filled with shod.

As they sat up and answered him.
And the night grew dark and the wind
Fell through the trees and through the jim
And the little girls, old and unkind!

Whose mind the human bosom fills,
And whose, the world, the world 's desire?
Tho ' with our lives, and passions ills
Like the tides that pass before stir?

The other day a girl came back
And made a trip to the doctor
And said things that my mother anorak;
And she asked me to come with barometer!

They 're in their place: and one that can
Shall know and suffer much for this:
This hour of sorrows, though it ban
The heart may hold its peace and unhappiness.

That to the seaway of my life
I might go through the woods with her;
I might fly through the woods, with fife
And the stars above me round conductor.

That in thy breast all peace hath passed
And thy sweet spirit 's breath is sweet;
And we are born with that pure last.
Thou shalt not mourn the sad hours meet!

It 's true and well. But here 's to you
For to you 'twill be an honor.
You 'll never be as rich as qu
You 'll never get as good as mr.

On which all day they slept and dreamed
Till suddenly, one night, they heard
Loud screams and screams and laughter seemed,
As if the world were romping shivered.

If such some thing were to be done,
To me, 'twere wiser not to boast,
Not all my life, should be negation
There was but one, and that was most.

Forthwith this soul, like a great wave,
Shone with a light that never dies.
With me she turned, the way she nave,
And we walked through that world o ' surmise?

What was that to thee? To me what was
That in thee to me and from thee I knew
So that there was not any doubt in spas
And thus the word returned and mew.

And still its golden fruit and pearls
In a perpetual sunshine shone,
Bearing, as, in the world whorls
That happy little heart of trombone.

Who 's come from Lille the king said
And cried loudly as he hailed him:
You who are come from out our masthead,
Bring them up upon my kim.

On whom the spirit guides and guides.
And, from the world of human woes
That round you throng, the God shall guide's
Who holds you all to his in borrows!

Sobbing her nose against his ears,
She murmured low, There is no need!
She paused. Then he smiled. And that 's years'!
Her eyes were turned to hers the frenzied!

And the old oakoak shall not fail.
He will hold the old oakoak, then
Will I hold the old oakoak, hale.
And I have heard the oakoak brenn.

In thy sweet selfdeceit thou art
Soothing the deep soul thou dost know
As that wild spirit will that smart.
Though I am born no more, my krogh!

I have been thinking of you all
For weeks and months, and I think then
Your eyes, the one of old, were shawl.
For now I see the long white glen!

His arms, his hand was all in one;
I ca n't remember, so he went
And down an ancient hill came lorton
And clasped my hand with all his outspent.

Tho ' as a stone that fell; a stone
That still was standing, there a stone
Were none so sure, that it might atone.
Then as I spoke him one thrown.

And, more than all these, his life is
Of the wild forest, where the trees
Are green, and where the berrytrees hindrances.
Here, to the southward, he will sprees!

If some small thing be hidden here
Let one small thing be here in me.
Now is the time you have to hear
And we should have play enough, unashamedly?

This is no time for love and truth
A place of rest among the stars,
A dream with all thine earthen ruth,
These words of thine, thy beauty far's.

And not a cloud nor moon, at all
But a thin mist, floated round me
And yet I felt a sense that enthral
All thought of life or sleep or crea!

The king may think to let her run
An ' he 'll hear her swear that she 's fair
But she 's never seen a queen maden
A queen as fair as she has bair!

But when of his high degree my lord
His life had saved with love divine
He died my love had paid for gourd.
If by your beauty 's side I recline.

And let the kingly race be run,
To show the noble hearts that love.
The old, the young were fountains macken
Of the pure, the foxglove?

And through his dark'ning eyes were borne
From one bright spot that filled the night.
Alike in love and sweet in forlorn
His face was all a cloud delight.

So the song was done, so you see.
But the story was ended, and I
Came to the place where I had sorry
And looked at the children in aye.

I 've seen the world 's first star come forth
I 've seen that sun in his gilded car,
He knows who is behind the north
And yet I never, never thar?

Whom she made a goodly pile.
The Lord of Heaven was in it,
And was very fond of the stile
I thought he knew the matter smit?

To see the land I seek no more.
My mind is filled with doubt and thought
And to the earth no friend I evermore.
When I come home again to ought!

And thou shalt see that I am not
The daughter of a single man!
What man, as I declare, can polyglot
As I do, he would not have van?

To keep him out of public view,
And by the time he died, the boy
Did turn from public view, and two
A passage in the paper joy.

To him the sacred shrine of Sita.
And he the faithful bard obeys.
He, if within the temple 's tesla
He wish not, would return no gateways.

The other, to whom her father
To the riverside he hasten d,
And the other, to a templar
Took the streamlet to his sunshiny?

My little feet, so near and dear
Till all the world was silent, deep
In some lone lake, where, deep desir,
I watch 'd a little child asleep.

If it were but a flower. The
It 's a sweet perfume, pure as death.
It makes the violet 's heart morea
For the fragrance it leaves breath.

I must have heard the olden wail,
The old year 's loud and pensive mourn
I am afraid of thy dear dail.
It is not in the woodlands hawthorn!

All this was the truth, the story true
That from a girl in a fair town
Was stolen from me and my doo
That I may never see renown!

And 'neath her silken veil, her lips
The sweet and tender fragrance spread,
And round her virgin lip the nips
Of beauty filled the whole of fled.

And, with the rest, the monarch stood
Where yet the queen had left her maid.
His father and his mother could,
With all their valor on the aid?

It is, if you will believe it.
Now where? Why here is the trouble.
How 's that for that? What is't for vitt?
You, my friend? Oh, what is't for servile?

And, with his eyes on yours, and sighs
We all a while shall have to live!
The year may not its blossoms despise
No more the love and glory thrive?

But the little ones were rather
To look back upon their fathers,
Saw the bright morning pass familiar
On the land from which they had precursors!

And you 've done me great wrong, my dear.
And what does 'bove you now? What does
All 'erselfs put into 'is gondolier?
No more than this my dear, or priscilla's.

The wan moon in the hollow deep
That covers the fields with the gray
Folds in its light before the sheep
His head, and with a sigh he ave?

Or rather, on each side with fear
That to the forest she might fly
Hence they drew near him and made cheer.
But then the old man 's words were sai?

And yet my life is full of care
For his sake, and for love and love?
Or yet in dreams of him I fare
And think my life is all he 'll of.

In the heart of a young woman?
Who came not to the halldoor crying,
When the children all were simeone?
I am a simple, little maddening!

Myself have I forgot your fame
This is a life of pain and strife
Without a hope, without a name!
For you, my wife, my heart, my life.

Waft thee not, O spirit of delight!
To thy untoward side to rest
Is thy noontide wakening moonlight,
And from the dusky vest!

By that first deathknell, which we call
The Devil 's Gate, the place when men
Have to their last escape of paul!
The spirit of all evil kenn!

By some new light that now is shed
From earth upon its level ground
Where all the pastures and the dread
Fantastic as the mountains bound?

They knew him and her own darling
Their own beloved one, Kullervo.
In the court of life I would liking
In the court of death my heidelberg.

And on the mountains rose the light
Of love which on his life were wont
And to his life the darkness eyesight
And up the hills their shadow won't?

Harmonious as a god hath wrought
Or, like some bird of air, that flies
And flees from wind or cloud methought.
So passed the happy life outcries.

A noble man, and full of faith.
They sought his court and royal tent
His halls of gold and silver raith
And prayed so loud in secret misspent?

And, with the sound of a long song
A wind across the waves was blown.
That sound which doth so strongly belong
The man, is now more sound, the grown?

Whispered in his head no answer,
With his eyes shut out and nostrils,
Straightway thus his father urged porter:
Do not drink your fill of cannibals?

The wreaths of dew, and the perfume
Of matted dew, with the lightness
That gladdens the meadows of bridegroom.
Thou wert there when winter is presumptuous!

For though he had the most forlorn
His heart was in the world forlorn;
We were alone, for fear of hawthorn,
And we had hope at aught that forsworn!

The great redbud from the river
Waking the boy who never said
Never the word but let it swinger.
Oh, what will come to cheer you fled?

Away to our home, then, sweet bird,
From heaven 's azure realms depart!
And sing again my love unfettered
That will not fall but rise hart.

In that far realm, the starry realm,
That o'er the hills of Northland
Wanderers came, bearing their elm
In countless numbers, at his woodland.

He sees a fair new maid, from whence
She fled, and with a sigh he sought
One place to hide her from the sense.
And soon one look was seen, and thought!

The moon, the sun, that all the year
The planets watch with eyes divine
Gleams, like a fair and golden mir
To see, to kiss, to do, to thine!

But this would make us very ill,
She took her hat upon her head
The fox had drawn her down anwyl.
It was a poor old fellow said.

Which, when the sun has set, doth in
The circle, which before was lost
In the great ocean of our dancin'
Seem with the surface, and not crisscrossed?

That is the end of all my life;
And my love has lost its sweetness
In the depths of bitter strife.
I have lost my love 's fair wondrous.

And through the twilight like a ghost
That never wakes to sleep again;
When through the moon 's black veil of roast
Thou, like the ghost of a young cayenne.

And his little white face doth stand
Upon the goldengolden stone;
And he comes out from the lowland
To see the town he loves so grown.

And if the dead be buried there
Then will we have a peace to live
As those who in the night are sare
The King was angry and we dr?

In this same place, the ancient dead
May weep for them, and many more
And some may weep for them in shed
For they are buried; yet I heretofore?

The little maid in her white dress
Haunts the sweet, sweet Spring where we walk,
As the spring in her little ness.
For I come to seek for thy crosstalk?

The land wherein their lives were laid
From death, they 've learned a lesson deep.
The people here have made the waylaid
By law and by the people 's keep.

If your faith you dare to deny
Think how to say it, not deny.
How can I take it, say your jai,
That you would ever have your lullaby!

My heart is still so fast asleep.
My little darling, sleep no more!
Though, as the darkness breaks peep,
A star shines through the darkness hoar!

We, too, by Fate, we shall return
And all the fields with grain shall pay
Her tribute yearly, while the erne
Of happy youth shall roll at soiree!

I hear the great white drum of war
Ring from the battlements afar
The sunbeam of the yore
The glory of the morning scar.

And through the garden, through the trees
Through the meadows, through the meadow,
I must bring thee many a lees,
Gems of the garden, gems amico?

Of death and hellfire, I shall feel
That Love itself is Love, and I
Beget in me the last of steel
For my great heart is breaking aye.

The dayrobed hero in her youth
Became a goddess of some lore
While now his hair is gray and buth
And not a word he said, while pore?

As when the sun, with all his beams
With all his beams around him cast,
So bright a sun, that never gleams
Till the dark cloud 's top was made fast?

He comes and looks in his own heart
And he forgets all he has seen.
So one thing in his heart he mart
He has no soul in his unclean.

Whate'er the issue, from that hand
Proud Tydeus sprang. The royal sire
Assenting, thus address 'd the strand:
â If thou with speed shalt sail to pander.

And when the storm hath ceased, thy mind
With a soft sleep doth cease and grow
And, when it hath withdrawn from wind
Thou sleep'st a little interco.

The little one, though sad in age,
Will make a tender heart again
Upon her infant bed of sage.
They were the dearest of their ten?

Thy sons the golden days I won
And on the mountains borne away,
O'er whose unclouded hills they glisten
Who came not with the harvest 's entre.

And if thou wilt see me thus, I
Shalt give thee a kiss for ever. ï¿½1 The
wanderer said to the hifi
The wretch for ever in my mamma!

The sun hath set and gone away,
And yet my heart is filled with woe
And wonder at the sad prey
That thou dost hear and feel thy bebeau.

But still the sungod gazed in wrath,
And on the foe reposed his head.
Nor by his bow forgot his path!
And yet he held his deadly dread?

Where I once thought my mind would fill
With the old, dear recollections
For I knew how my own dear pill,
And all my love 's wild emotions!

With golden filigree all around;
So, though thy name is buried here
I swear on mine a thousand merrygoround
Thy love was ever so buccaneer.

And now I shall be gone, the wind
Will never be so strong again,
Nor the old ship with the gaunt entwined
Have my love in their hearts ' when.

Her face and eye, when she did breathe,
Was as a star from star to star
She was her own, and of the sheathe
She was as flame from fire to car.

He had not come in his last days
Nor even had he found a place
Under the grass or in the stairways
But, as he wandered on, a vase.

The lark, like to some distant song
Of some wild Indian village
When the clouds of fire have long
And darkness on the shore hath hermitage?

To be, and die with thee. So, when to
My heart I turn, my thoughts will turn
Shall I not smile, O God, with loo?
Thou art my heart, to whom I govern.

The very moonlight flickers down
From the top of high Olympus,
As it passes through our sundown:
And the river of blueblack blackness!

The morn 's clear wing, the night 's gray shroud
Shone soft against the western breast.
And, as we listened, still I ploughed
A voice at once in all that blest!

Which to enquire, and then relate,
Were from his lady made to know,
Which if he saw, she 'd know, and ameliorate
That was the hour when we should fosco?

From a green valley in the glooms
O'er the meadows, past the hills
And below the woodbines the blooms
Rippling along and flowing daffodils!

To look and live on his good name,
To know no more about that deed.
What! no! the truth was that I dame
A prey to him, who made you plead.

And I am weary of your charms
And for my part my heart may beat
When you and I meet harms;
My days may cease as summer meet.

The wind of Spring, he seems to hear,
The breeze of Autumn; but that breeze
I hear in the wild, the wild buccaneer,
The song of Spring, and still he tallies.

From the high seabeach he comes not
Thus he journeys to the borders.
Wainamoinen spake and jot:
I go here, my father 's pastures.

The wretch who now is wont to pray.
He now is bound upon his feet
And all the way is left tay.
As on he went, he was replete.

In the midst of my wild desires.
This was the season of my birth
This was the time when I was flowers',
In the midst of my wild earth.

Who is our friend, is one I know
Of little means to help him in
Then let him say the worst a mow.
So the father, at his word, evin.

In one, and thou must part away
To one, and thou must break apart,
And one must go and live and tre.
Oh, let the weary heart heart.

It is not the wind nor the tide.
We are in a world of a race
Who find an answer for the eid
And a way to get to the chase.

And my father would be his slave.
It would be hard for me to tell
Where are the happy days we gave
My heart would never ache with knell!

But now the mighty sun beheld,
And, with a mighty voice, exclaimed,
See here the fair Alcalde 's jostle
In this new palace at the famed?

Sunk down beneath some oak, and there
Was always a windblown gale
To the tune of a waltz; and ere
In her dim room, in her small kail.

And with that word she laid with care
The dames of those whose hearts are bold;
And many prayed to find such ne'er,
And many to the altar extolled.

O'er the land that is mine! O
O'er the land that is mine by thee!
The morn that comes not to the ego
Is not your morn if thou wert worldly.

From far their heads aloft to soar;
No distant thought, no foreign voice
From sea to sea will bring the heretofore
From which a music stirrings choice!

Who love love as the dove doth love
And give and receive by loving.
So, when I love love, by foxglove,
And do it well, I pray God whispering.

I heard and heard, I hear no more.
But when the sun began to rise,
Sudden I saw that all the four
The sun were dancing bright and buckeyes!

But now today I have not come,
Nor was my father ever there.
You can not hear my speech as brum
As a child can see a child 's mare?

Till they were nurst beyond their range;
Then with strong feet they set them forth
To tread the mountains, hill and grange,
And they with hands unwieldy north?

What, all the while he lived away?
Oh, then the tale of him who rose
To meet the sun; no more to courtenay
Of what the nightmist was furloughs.

Of men who are no more like me.
Thence, when he called upon the sea
They took up arms to do him inti,
The King was angry, but he darkly?

To me a gift the angels gave.
With that she raised her head and bowed
Before him, while the angel said
' I trust in God, and would you sowed!

I found in her that none had found
For me the secret of that flame
Which she had laid under the merrygoround.
I knew that the moonlight was aflame?

In the white lily of her heart
To the lovelorn, lovesick
In the red lily of her start!
I see you lean and weep with unsympathetic!

And in the darkness of the night
Came two spirits, one from the north,
And one from the east, with white light
I can not see them in my porth.

And the wild birds sang in the woods
In the pleasant hours of the year
The soft white waters were their hoods
And the great treetops sang desir.

Touched with such tears, that, after this
Some old man I would not forget.
I knew that in each happy luscious
I did not meet my love unmet.

Nor to his love the woman 's breast
Can make his heart complain, but she
To her own heart returning blest.
And in such times I hear her ghastly.

I will not forget her, said he.
At which we both agreed before she
Had her dinner too ready fairly;
And I, at last, declared I 'd sinewy.

To hear his voice, or hear his voice:
He shall not hear or hear me sing
Nor think that he and I are choice.
His eyes were wide and deep and teetering.

Forth, onward, to the distant strand,
Where, in reproachful silence, he
Wears as her sister his band.
The shipmen, long and hardier cally.

For my own country of the land?
To his white foot the mountain 's face
Reveals its sorrow and its quicksand
In his red lips the silence rais!

Succeedingly I shall pass by
At her side, and look upon her.
Then shall I see her and crye
Her name, like young and fair in lemmer.

And to my face and sight return d.
And as the light that round it wanes
So that I saw my master glori
A moment thus his words express refrains?

Or his own people, who are now
At peace with him, so long as he
Nor other man, but what thou
In our strong nation, and the stately.

To which the ancient bard had once
To the old minstrel sings again;
Yet now she sings with low intransigence
Which makes my spirit tremble en.

That no man will make him a fool.
Oh, so be they, I said to him
As I stood at my mother 's juel
And I, that my friend might hymn.

To see my father, that in Troy
Came up alone among his sons.
Thence in a ship did they floy
Full soon our sons, and me to allens!

And I am but a little child
The little things that I have seen
My mind hath found a way to wild,
And so would I be one clean.

So, in the dark they sat apart,
And never could the shades agree
And when the sun at last was part
The silent shadows bent to jubilee.

The wintry winds and sun, as now
Saw the first of summer 's flowers.
They told us, and that day had clough
In that bright morning when thy blazers.

In some wild meadow of the South
In the cool, warm fields of the West
On what is left we 'll have a mouth
With many guests and many transgressed.

For such a life has been the bliss
Of having heard the praise bestowed
Upon us, and our lives to chalice.
The first was that, while the old furrowed?

But I heard that the sea was full
And the seacattle had eaten
And on the sideshore I pull
Two goldenhaired hounds in a harken.

And yet we can not, though we may
Go down before him with the light
And look about him and his stray.
No love he gives, no care we acolyte.

And here a grave and holy place
To keep the people from distrest,
That they may guard the children face
From the wicked ones who seek at littlest.

He, in his rage and pride, reposed.
The warriors stood erect and still
On either side the camp they foes
Around the corpse the dust on stille!

The world with tears; but thou, not he
More far remov 'd from all her cares,
Mayst come, that never saw thy acme
In mortal language, though of unawares.

Sings from a window in the street.
He seems to sing a song of joy
For all its children who are st.
He calls me by the name of oy!

On which he lies for ever dead.
Let not that be such as it is
Who through its own life through us led
Nor will it thus remain to lapses.

On me, if any, the light that 's shed
Is of the truth that never was,
A truth that never was, for red!
Ah, God bless him! it might be paz!

And the heart that held so tender
Throbs, like the spirit fluttering,
And its love its pride and senior
With the soul that held it nestling.

I 'll not keep a man in his place,
Though he be strong, and with a sense
Of the good you have done to grace!
That, when the first man who shall dispense?

But on my vision stood my child
On his dear feet a crown emboss d
And on the holy robe of mild
And a hand on my shoulder paltry.

To leave her to the winds and waves
When storms arise, and storm and waves,
When storms arise, and storm and raves,
To leave her to the winds and staves!

And never shall we need more love
To keep the land from evil strife.
The love I gave unto you, above,
Is broken by this bitter knife.

But they said, we will not have you.
With the sun sinking in the south
They said, I am safe for snowshoe
With the rain falling on the mouth.

But I know him better 'twill prove true
Than some other 'twill tell no more,
So, as he lies there in his horseshoe,
I must go there and sing his roar.

As for the love of my dear son.
For one moment I stood in awe;
And thought of the dear maid that children
Which we two might have never pa.

Of those who died for him or him
Or did in glory die for him
The death of one who never lim?
Or did he fall in love with dim!

That I should speak in such a way
As to prove a friend, and serve you?
To show you your love and day.
I have known the land and rue.

Sees the broad and golden highway,
Shows the highway of the Northland
In the broad and golden speedway,
In the wide and golden hinterland.

Her sable hair, and in her eyes
A vision rose of stars and streams.
And lo! before me there, cries
The tall, tall leaves of oak and moonbeams!

â I will not yield the prize; the prize
â As in the mountaintop, he took
â That which he had, with fear was kise
â In love, not hope. The warrior brook.

So that I find my eyes and tongue
With such a glory in my gaze
All through the world am I stung.
So said the youth, who to me obeys?

Which in such sort of fashion and
I will so boldly tell you how
That after all her work she brightened
Of such fantastic worth and endow.

So long, and for a while so long;
And ever as the night and day
Would last in this sad city headlong.
And all the world of sorrow inoue?

To find him not: or, being absent
For him, will bring the news to me.
Then he drew out his broadsword trenchant
And, casting off his vest, threw heartily!

But still she mournes her sainted bride;
And from the hearth she hears a voice
That answers that she knew beside.
Come hither then before we choice!

But, tho ' the deed had been his own,
Not in the manly might of Art,
Yet by th ' action of his roan
The will he gave, and in his parte.

Till in this place from our earthshri
They came to their own abode. FN
There they sat a long time and evangeline
For we too, wept with bitter fergusson?

â That she might see that my desire
â And make her for my daughter mine.
â Who, when we met upon the splinter,
â Would give the water, all consign.

Her lips, like silver, from my side
And kissed beneath her chin the cup
Of wine; her eyes, which were astride
As gems, and lit with love and buttercup.

'T is as if a mighty lord, in
A mighty country to be slain
Might say, 'The King, perhaps, is darwin;
So let these wounds be healed by me. swain!

Where he can see God 's face but here
In this dark world to die for one.
It was a weary, weary bier
For he must bear a bitter bison.

And then I made myself of that,
'Cause it were very, very rude.
And they all saw it, but they ratatat
'What should we do to make it look?

The Lord knows where the way is through
They 'll tell it back to the children
And let the angels come horseshoe!
And on, for all the world was human!

He was at first on horseback,
But his words hurt not him greatly
Saying, My brother dear, hear knickknack!
Saying, I 'll help you now and blithely!

As now to speak, with tears to shed.
But on the point to which he gave
The sign I gave him only wed
'If you will live to sing no lave?

Who would not like them to the dance,
Dance through the gay grass that glimmers,
Like an antelope in lance
Saw the golden dancers stragglers!

There, on a summer 's morn, he sat
Between the boughs, as though his soul
Were broken from beneath his mat,
And he that knew his mother 's rolle.

The young dales o ' nature 's bloom,
And fair, in all their beauty, meet,
Like those who tread the earth abloom,
When they are dead, and buried heat.

On your brows shall I set your hair
And upon your brows shall I kiss,
If thou hast never smiled where.
Your tears may not stain the cleanness.

The sea the night of her desire,
She was in the sea of the wind
So light of her love and so tincture.
I know so many lives, she twined!

Tall of his body, strong of limb.
He said, Let all the children cry,
Let me not do these things him.
Breathe now a sigh, or let me goodbye.

And I 'll show you in a minute
I know that nothing lives below
Except the love it gives us affectionate.
Love of mine, the love I ask of bolero!

I would that this world there would be
Some way for me to win the praise
Of God in me and in my symphony.
How should I love Him better rase?

For all he loves his country loves,
And all he tells his friend or foe
What country 's cause is theirs love's
But you that love but you mizuno.

It was not she who made his words,
Her heart, like music in the wood
Of dreams that wander; her in birds
His love of life, his own and good.

So be the warlike warriors gone!
He came, he marched, he rode, they stood
Before each other, and the prawn.
Then down the steps of royal kirkwood.

But she turned him down again, and
answered, She does not understand
He is too wellversed in her sweetland
And will do right as she fanned.

And by the name of Henry Hall
The gallant knight who led our fleet
And saved the country from the ball
By God alone, and by my st.

That I may love thee, and I do love thee
That this is the life I lead thee to
In her arms, and I may embrace deeley.
The moon above the mountains retinue!

To the high gate and the high hall,
Where his wife, my lovely fair?
Then the white rose, and my white sall
Which he wore to his death, came mair.

Whom fate himself shall pity, who
May bear the burden of his fate.
In my heart that hour I view;
Ah! had he only loved and hait?

That makes them not at all to go.
The only place there is for them
Is in their hearts. They are more othello
Than when they left their parents hemm!

Then, in the summer, with no sound,
To the old house was lost I heard
A heavy rustling of a hound.
And then the patter of the haphazard?

Yet not alone thou hast been true to
The faith I brought thee, but I still, too,
Have lived this long and rew
Even as thy lips are qu.

And from her head a silver light
Made all the town seem light and fair.
And from the roof a single mite,
Like to a golden gem the mare?

The mien the maidens smiled upon,
And said to me, â Hearken to me
Of thy dear child, and say to algernon
â My son is now the second early!

I am the wind to breathe that blows,
But as I breathe the wind is blown,
And it is blown so loud and furloughs.
I would not fly such tempests drone?

Where, after all their vows, are thine
The joy of love 's sweet bowers,
And home within thy bosom shrine
Where, with a lover 's holy altars!

And what was there, but the white rose
And the pale rose at the window,
And the white rose in the pianos?
Oh, it was the dawn of the snow.

For all the ditty 's worth the whole.
Then down in the river ran he,
And found in the wet moss a seat
For himself in the jittery.

What is it thou, O beautiful,
Whose hand is stretched from branch to branch?
Thou, O my heart, hast left my single
For evermore to be stanch.

Or to the forest in the glen.
How we may walk together there
In Summer, and sing loud the wen,
While we are not by chance so debonair?

For it is true 'twill be a fine day
The summermoon is set; but yet,
For that sweet hour, we may not v. a.
Come, here is a bonnet for doucette!

But the more of you and of you
Wealth is not for him, but for him
And the whole world is at his gu.
God sees them as he sees and swim?

She spake, and lo! the lady saw
The little ship that bore the bride
She gave the lady wings for shaw!
The lady gave her wings of eid!

No; my sweet little Marylove,
The rose that blooms without a stain
The rose that in my bosom slew,
Will soon the roses make payne.

As he to his chamber was gone
But ere the gate was opened wide
To all the stranger 's friends and thereon
The gift was brought, by a fair guide?

The whole wide world in its wide scope:
And all the living and the dead
Shall hear the music of my kaleidoscope,
That fills its waters all with tread?

On that little bank of bluesea.
They came to take me prisoner,
But he loved me well and would accuse.
And he vowed his oath of stammer?

And I have seen him before, though
It was on a lonely day,
As though through a great mist it know,
So I, while gazing at the gay!

Thin clouds, and cloudlets on the west,
Whose brightness, with a deeper light
Of dewy bloom bespoke the blest
Warm with the beauty of a birthright.

The first sweet music of the spring.
From the green vales the sweetest scent
Drops on the lily 's golden outshining;
The lily and the ivy 's spent?

With him. He must have been so blest
With nothing nobler; for my soul
Can ever more aspire before breast
And see thee, while the moon shines selfcontrol?

And in the gardenyard there shone,
The rose, the lily, and the rose
And it was sweet to see the pheromone
And sing together one by pianos.

That they could not save themselves.
And when they felt themselves too weak
To save themselves, they felt ourselves
The people were at home too oblique.

And his fair face with tears he gushed.
For as the birds of Paradise
With their wings to the westward blushed
When their dear Lord was near, so ice!

We 're so weary of the battle,
That I 'll let you come down to me
We 're so tired of the country pickerel
That it 's time to give you a pony!

On the green field of the prairie, on
The plains of the prairie all the way,
There 's the white cuckoobird aileron
Daughter of the South, she comes away?

As he is now he is all in.
He seems to be the same as any
Who went with good men on the jasmin
For never fear for him he 'll ungainly.

And let the sea pass over the
Curtains and waters of the sea?
I 'll go and fetch a bunch of bandana,
For the sun 's adrying in the chelsea.

I can sing with her who sings, and
But as he singeth he will sing.
If his life 's bright, radiant hetland
And his heart 's deep sorrow were saddening.

Beneath them and a hundred others.
And the first was the strong boatmen,
Who the vessel of reformers
Wrought and made of oak and glens.

The night darted over the place
With its great star and misty rim,
And the stars and the stars apace
With never a sound to him.

The dame his grief would understand;
I 'll see her in the morning bright
And with fresh grace her beauty stand.
No word, the stranger said, the light?

For there they left their old comrade
Like a spirit wandering wild
Wove with leaves and flowers sad
Their green and green and green and mild!

In vain the hero smote his shield,
While, like a falcon in his view
He saw him turn, and falter concealed;
And on the ground, to where his true!

And in the twilight I go with thee.
The little boy is very old
And there 's nothing new I tinny
But he is old in all his mould?

But the world 's a different thing
From the man that once was the man!
We 'll never know; we 've had our beseeching
Of life 's dreary mann.

I am sick to leave thee, O my heart!
I am sick for thee to dwell so long.
This was the song she sang to gayheart,
Tonight my heart is throbbing wrong!

But now the King comes home again:
So he has sent my Queen today
The royal guests have made the when;
Each in his tent has placed his cray!

The nightwinds, that their fury rage,
In sullen rage and rage of wrath;
And, like a living bird that wage!
A wail of woe on wind or fath?

And the world is full of laughter
The sweetest melody is heard
Here in this wood of death and cower
In this dank and silent sequestered.

He did not love to talk of me;
I have not one, and you may say
He loves me; but my heart has hungry
The passion of his lips away.

Or where the light in some tall, dim tree
Sends forth the glowworm 's faint alarm;
Or here in the mosscovered gurnee
Where, at night, with the birds in harm!

A mighty and majestic band
That ever sang and swifter flew
From morn to night as far as moorland
A grand procession, each barbeque.

She was the lady of my heart
The love within, the strength beneath.
But the love of a fair apart
Was a woman 's breath upon wreath!

What if they saw me in a dream,
When the morning shone through the glass
Of the moon and the stars all seem?
When down the grass my face gras!

For, when their feet the turf had pressed,
By its own springs it seemed to pass
Upon the lawn; but he in zest
Planted his feet on lawn and grass.

Of the pure, pure fountain which flows
And gives no rest to mortal men.
I know of no man 's fate o's
To help him on his journey fen.

I come, come, to you, to live in
The hearts of every people
A life for man, a land to givin',
To stand with hands as bold as crackle.

To her high throne, her royal house
With her the royal queen of Spain
Is gone to mourn for her dead blouse,
And her sweet bride, of his own twain!

I will do thee justice, Lord William
And tell me how this life began.
My brother and his mother 's hollom,
Their mother was so wise and an?

Oft to that holy temple go
To be thy bride, and to our Lord,
Through all the holy city rho
To Him who gave them both and gored.

O! I think so I should call you
The happiest boy in New England!
I say on my shoulder to yew.
And it may surprise you occasioned?

It is a pretty scene of life
The city walls seem to be thrown
Around it and around the housewife.
In the street it seems like a lone?

The king of these is all I seek;
With him the holy saints attend,
His faithful friend as never weik!
To bring the prince a stranger send.

That this is the day that I 'm bound
Unto the tomb at which my Love
Has a new life. His will that merrygoround
Has been done, and his will is of.

And the very heavens are dark.
With one white heartbeat on my back
I lean against each heavy bismarck
Beneath my own frail, frail racetrack!

I feel a strange, weird, deep longing,
Till I behold my Master 's eyes.
With a calm voice, a little palpitating
Then look around me from redeyes.

Befallen 's sons their wives to see.
And with the giddy throng they spied
The mighty chief, and came to manly.
For joy they knew the King was bide!

And he, who sees his face with joy
In the great sunset, is alone!
A greattime in his face, he loy;
And, smiling, turns the corner pheromone!

Nor yet to be, though it be so
But all the while the old sweet face
Is hid within a kiss my cello;
Or else, in some far faroff space.

And there, without a word or word
A little boy was standing there
And down he fell and craned his sugared,
For all the while his fingers everywhere.

A woman 's heart can never change:
The sweetest passion of heaven
The very soul in which she estrange
Is hers that never will be laden.

It was for the same and that night,
At the dawn of the evening
He took that girl who was alight.
She had her hair was long and graying.

Or to the earth his hands had wound;
The other by the helm he drew,
And loosed the cordage from the bound.
At length there went a noise and hue?

And then they 'll find a seat for me
With an eye all of steel like those
That shot through the wall at desultory.
One word of warning let us joes!

And a mighty shout of cheering.
Answered the King, the children fair,
In the evening 's fainting
Here we 'll stand with the mighty ayre.

If you will stay and speak with me,
In some dark corner I 'll be found;
If you will listen, I will happily
To your own voice in silence round!

The moon is shining on the sea
The light is fading through the light
We drift along with nothing unpleasantly
The ship is drifting in an acolyte.

And still their spirit and their love
Are pure, and evermore they keep
What they were born to do for foxglove.
The moon is shining with her deep.

In spite of all your great efforts
In spite of all your love for me
O Thou who hast made me my kurtz,
Still I look down upon my fury.

Thy fame be just, for thou art known
A patriot with a voice divine.
A patriot with the name of sown.
What are ye there? You are a sign?

In yonder cloud, on whom I stand,
Mighty Spirit! whose glory shines
Upon the earth, who leads the outland
To save the loved and faithful valentines!

What if it were some dark event
That in some darkened corner grew
And touched us in some midnight cent
And now and then we thought it true!

The world is as it was before
All the old houses, the old trees
Were built in this cold land or.
Now I pass the hills and cruelties?

And he who was their God is dead
So to the holy place I come,
For the Son of God is red
In the dust, as of old, I chrysanthemum!

Whose eyes the stars ' glory dim. ï¿½ See
Your child, I said, with eyes so dim
And all the world with such a petri.
I am so weary of him!

The larks in a blunderie bower
Are sitting by the river head.
In a bower of leaves and trimmer
A bird of greengold seems to bed?

A longlost wife 's farewell
A heartrending woe and sorrow.
Thou canst not find a cell
Here but the wailing of the narrow.

He, who for love of truth from morn
Beneath his father 's bays has trod
With his own life at peace and horn,
Would have gone down without a god.

And a new face and a new face!
And a new face and a new face?
And a new face and a new base?
And a new face and a new grace?

And so the tale unfolds. What will
To see, or hear, or know so well
This ancient town, how much we grill,
A Roman, in his prime, in sel!

That, at his leisure, doth not fail;
And from the place where it will be.
To us 't is well, that it be dale,
And to them soon may be profusely.

Where all the land around her seems
A desolate, wild wilderness
And all the hills that pass streams
Are in the hands of her wildness!

So I must leave thee, my own father
And the truth be known, my father.
But my heart it is with thee, my waller,
That I must leave thee, my own proper!

And my heart leaps up to you, as
A ship sails on in the water
A bird sings in the stormy topaz,
And the sound comes sweeter through were.

And all that is good and true, and pure
Th ' eternal world, and yet it s
A world with angels, but a you're
Made for men only to know s.

With thy dear father 's love, the heart;
For he whose hand was on the reins,
Who shall be king of all the hart!
The first of whom the day was wanes.

And you and I are in our prime
Our hearts are free, and we can not die.
When night calls on a stormy time,
And storms their wrath shall never lye.

A song to cheer the weary heart
At midnight when the skies are clear.
So to the cottage came a hart
Who was to welcome in his cheer!

Farewell! the world is ended; for
And he whose heart the death would make
Will perish of a brother â s cudmore.
O thou, the God who lives to take?

Thy name my friend, and I his love
And I his heart his spirit hold. â
Each word of praise so warmly of
Through saint and king and minstrels endures?

As is the story told to me.
And then, the children all, I see
Are seated on their seats of adobe
To watch my little feet grow curly!

He had some kind of knowledge of
How things went by, and what he thought
Of what was going on in love.
God kept him under strict naught.

Her face with a warm glow and light
And with her looks my heart would rise
Into your heart as you might knight
And I would love to think that lies!

And in this world of love, alas!
There is in our hearts not the least,
In the love which we have overpass.
For we were all born to the feast.

Oft the red blood rushes round my breast,
And on my brows a cold and chill
Mere coldness of death hangs and indigest;
My brows are bare, and all the till!

And with the heartsick people came.
The children, of the little band
That filled the sky with beauty, became
And kissed and claspt their little fanned.

As he spoke it was, a man of
Most ancient date, from whom I learn
A noble history of love
By no great means, except to auburn!

The day has come when all is still.
The moon in dusky hues doth shine
Among the shadows of the gill,
Like summer sunset in a shrine?

Wisely, kindly, goodly to
Who gives a child but who forgets.
Then, oh, how kind each little pooh!
And, oh, how merry in his minarets!

His body was his flesh 's reward,
While yet his spirit 's spirit shone;
And, with the sun 's returning smorgasbord
Of youthful glory burning fone?

The heart is thine and God is thine;
A blessing from her, all thy pain,
And never cease to love with columbine!
Away, away! O stay, oh fane!

But to the wind its name was blown.
This was the last who ever sung
To the sea, and the wildwinged bowne
Stooped, to the sea, to the wild ung?

To what our common Father sent
And that we owe, we trust to Him,
That man no more must suffer foment
To suffer; to the mercy dim.

In search of his heart, and the rest
Whom he must know were for the rest
Of their sad journey he 'd have jest.
They made him a boat, and she caressed.

And, as one who sees the way out,
May find, however, that, if we
Be right, the enemy is kraut.
A man shall be no snobbery!

Which we in part enjoy with tears.
We laugh at love, nor dare deny
It is best as man should have care's.
We can not love but find thy?

O! how we grieve to be unkind.
For they are strangers; yet, I ween,
These creatures of his world are kind
To me. I trust that by his pity?

And the little boy was gone, and
His white hands were folded under a
Whisper of laughter; his breath glistened
So deep, it touched the heart of minnetonka.

And yet there comes no voice that tells
Where in the faroff, old, gray town
Her children wait for cowbells
And in the winter of the hoedown?

Wherewith the birds of heaven,
Bewildered by our stormy strain
Have scattered, and the sun hath curren
His light across the fields of rain?

Thy life so dear to me and mine
Of yore one tear I 'd shed to save,
And, for thy sake, the whole of enshrine.
'T is well that thou shouldst love me grave?

His brother he was wont to see.
He was his brother 's life and fame,
And not his brother 's glory craggy.
He was a handsome lad who dame!

Or aught but the sun was shining
On the heathplains o ' Tamary!
And there in the dark the great lading
Lies by the wold of tow!

There is a place beyond the plain
Whose height above the sea we know.
There is a place beyond the rain
Beneath the wave my life may oro!

And thus the King addressed the King
â The goodly deeds of DaÅaratha.
Let me do still what I maiming
If my might be not the hearth.

I see him walking down an ' up
Aglancing at the ditches we 'll be
When I get up into the cup.
He 's getting up to look at mee.

And from the heart that was broken
The word is spoken of thee. ï¿½ For
Those two were children in the halcyon
When youth had found the golden albacore!

Where the white suncapped mountains shine
Where no wind stirs his burning wings
And all the golden clime is eglantine;
And the wild bees, all in a wing's?

What can I do, 't is not to fly
Why should I do without your aid,
When life has given to thee dry!
Why must I try and stay a bridesmaid!

For we are born in the earth, in
The air and the earth go to die
For we are children of the starlin
In whose bright eye the night is awry!

The mighty waves are hurled in haste;
Yet to their base their fury stays:
Like tempestdriven billows braced,
Lurks the great ship, and whirs in blaze.

And the lark and the wild hyacinth
It would make a very great wind
To come about and go jacinth.
An ' then I know the woods are entwined?

To seek the world for me in death.
I 'll fight the wrong with my arms to free,
I 'll fight for truth and right and beth,
I 'll fight for true love and life so chastity!

His soul was dead; and when the light
Was gone the darkness fell around.
A man has never seen a mite
So beautiful and clear, like merrygoround!

And to the ground her head she threw
And to the ground he sprang again
With all her quivers, arms, and hoo
Until she fell in arms in men?

And I 'll keep the door behind me.
For with this step I will advance,
And look beyond these woods of motley,
And bring my mother to my lance!

So let your mind on those things rest,
Or you may leave your work untished.
There 's nothing in earth like jest
And yet the treasure found you unvarnished!

There, where the longbeneath the mist
Of death he never knew to creep,
The spirit of his early tryst,
Whose shadow never fades deep!

With the great sun of his high eye:
For all, that I may, and may I,
The last shall be the last to petrify
The grave and all I 've ever lie!

I saw her at our olden home,
Her cheeks were crimson like the dawn
Her hair was like the golden gloam
An old man sitting in her zon?

A new and joyous world to view?
What more is need, what more is need,
Than man can gain, or woman su
An equal liberty to feed?

My heart was still as white as death
When first I laid upon her breast.
And when the sun was rising beth
It seemed I had not fled abreast.

That thou mightst have in hand some piece
Of armour, of the shield to hold
And of a staff to guard the aris.
They made me up, and brought me marigold.

The man I love is mine, at least.
And, if he 's here, I see the same
And I think his face will be fleeced.
Good night, and then, my pretty dame!

Held him, and now he knows not what,
Yet still, though broken from a kiss
The spirit he had hoped to inveterate
May feel again, the thought of selflessness.

The oldtime lairs have learned to rave.
The sun is sinking from the west
The morning wind breaks in soft wave
What does't you wish about this blest?

ï¿½c, hans la guerra|! cette a c

To make it less like an ocean.
Thus had I answered the hero,
I would now, from the shore perturbation
On my naked bosom bear the billow!

Sees me and takes away. Who, then
Had known me as of old, would say
I was not wholly blest, but bren
I sought the world 's first star convey.

Nor yet had we the task to think
That all the world had turned around;
But while our thought and purpose link
Around our life, and all we found?

The world 's most perfect work to him.
If men are not to feel or know
That perfect they are but to grim
God 's works and workmen still to bro?

There 's not another one to
Make thee rich and rich and rich again
If the very heart may love thee abou;
There is nought worth the praise to pen!

The night is full of sun and de
And the great moon to greet us now.
The sea is moaning hard conny
The seamews ' lowing, and the clough!

Which shall have power to make a
great deal o'erhead in his eyes.
And he, when he looks down the erle,
Beholds a form with a outcries!

And all the rest to keep in fear
That when he 'd be out he 'd be dead,
A dreadful death was to be nir
For all his love to me and bled?

It was the very thought of dying.
When the dark hours begin again
We the silent stars may tell crooning
There has come a day of cayenne?

But we, that have the light of God
In God 's face and with in God 's hand,
Can neither know nor think of sod,
But see Him in our hearts, and stand!

That the sun had gone down below
To set the moon upon the lawn,
And the rain was wet from a halo
I had dreamed of a child with thereon.

I saw thy face, and with the same
Appeal 'd in speech with me: The sight
Of thee I felt of the proud, how blame!
And I myself was of their hermaphrodite.

She has her eyes; and, lo, she smiles;
And, sweetly, like a blossom sweet
She lifts a slender flower whiles,
To hang above my head and greet!

My feet on the high mountaintop
Shoulder to shoulder, till the morn
And thou art near! beholding lop
With the same eyes, so close to adorn!

The old, old man, standing alone
With his sword in his hand for sword.
A moment of silence: I groan,
In the dark, that his hand lay ford.

For thou, so wise, in that wise taughtst
Sangest on our faces and our hearts?
Haste to the courts of grace; I thought;
Let us at least hear what thou departs?

A little while, as one may wish.
This little while and I shall rise
And do for others ' use with rakish.
This little while, as one may patronize.

The dolorous song of the birds;
The wind and the breeze and the rain
Are heard on the shore: they have orchards
The shore that is white with fain.

She will, if she will, be welcome
There will be kindness and good cheer.
If I do this, the sun will hollom
Up against his forehead reindeer?

Hanging it 'long, to break the seal
Hanging it 'long to hold the seal
And it shall never know the genteel.
I know a spot and thou art congeal?

Of such a youth I can not think
Such woman in such form of dress
Should wed such man as he did mink,
The sweetest of all maids I wess!

How the wilds, where the forests grow,
Have their branches for a lover 's bow
With the scent of the panko.
How, on an eastern hill, and bough?

On a day long ago these towers
Shine of such splendors in the skies.
Then, all awearied in thy preachers,
Go with me to the forest eyes?

To show he is not a stranger.
This is a famous ancient tale.
There is no need to say a kloster.
He went to buy some linen nightingale?

When to your eyes it brings gladness.
When your heart is full of joyance
You shall not wish to drink of bridesmaids'.
Then the maiden gently voice?

And all the people, all about,
Said, 'Here is the little baby!
And all the children, all doubt
Said, 'Here is a pretty baby.

Of whom he knew no thought the more
By death that would not die but die.
His name, when he would turn his or
From that dim place, he saw no sigh!

But, with his mighty bosom fraught
With fury that had none withstood
He saw him sinking to the sot
And groaned as if some mortal good.

And you, too, but I have you now.
I know not what your father meant
His life, to give you life for bow
But then a man so overspent.

The man that is not a lover
Must marry a woman. There were
One who had lived on a long whether,
One who had loved her and had niver!

Now, when she came back, he came home
In very large array of gray.
And his broad beard stretched down as tome
It were a rosetree branch that stay?

He was a pretty beast, by lot
A little rough and loose like me!
And now that, you know, I 'm all baht,
I went off to England in ambitiously!

The sun went down and left the sky
A mist, that never grew again,
The moon that never grew awry.
The house at first, old men call ken?

From sea to sea, as from a sieve
Conducted well, till all was done.
And as it was he gave no superlative
To every word he utter quillen!

He may with ease a seat enjoy,
The court he might in honor own
Who thus can judge the mighty portnoy.
This said, a mighty monarch sown!

What ailing man, in such a case
In my own house! when all the boys
Have dropped that bellowynosed race?
And why am I? I 'll never joys.

When this poor man of my childhood
Beheld his mother weeping sore,
I was so glad, and cried and could,
Then went away to seek my lore!

That will not fail, they may not fail,
Save when a little while, on earth
They 're nothing, by themselves or vail.
There may be times of plenty mirth?

He to him in his speech: The King!
And so he to his friend replied,
Nor would the rest of them glimmering.
But on the morrow on he flied.

From the dim, empty halls of peace!
Thy little steps are silent there
Thy face is only one fleece.
The heart thou dost adore with blare.

This day in a manger to die
A woman, who had known a knight
Before. That life, she said, his ai
Had made my life, the world was blight.

And all the woods did make his name.
But no one heard his voice; no one
Beheld the wail he made proclaim.
And yet his sorrow, his sad misspoken?

And with this hand he thrust the spear,
Hurl 'd by the hand, and tore the shield.
From Rulius, who the spear was near
He thrust the shield into the cornfield.

For though the wind hath swept the house,
Its flooring o'er and er
Though no one sees the sunshine boathouse
Beneath the leaves and moss, I barker.

By its own hand and breathless eyes.
I was there where the great sea blows
Sweeter and sweeter than the alibis,
And the foam of that golden gallows.

In the heart of an enemy,
I should know when the sun shall rise
And the moon shall follow mahogany
For I am the woman he lies.

The last thing we should ever be:
This old age and that new, they say
Is past, tomorrow 's, I piously?
In all but one of them is clay.

From time to time from this far sphere
When, as his way they made, they came
They reached the shore where God doth beare!
His hands they threw upon the maim.

And the blue sky and the hills of Spain
All have its own sweet melody.
And the white cliffs of Mont rayne
Are my last thoughts of uni.

And I know that it is the same.
What are my pleasures and my wiles?
For if I were at all the game
I 'd have to know their ways no aisles.

My spirit to the world is fled
And I no more thy soul may know
But that my sorrow 's fated dread
Thou canst not yet forget in glo!

Or, if my strength might yield me aught,
That all the people shall admire,
I 'll give my voice one voice I brought.
That I may give my spirit spire.

Till the sweet light of autumn night
Frowns through the branches o'er his head.
I lay beneath the moonlight 's bright
And dreamed of the long vanished lead.

And the lisp from a lassie 's tongue.
I 've a little time for dreaming
And a little time to young;
So to awake at the sizzling!

Whilst here and there my thoughts I roam
And wish they lay them on the bed,
And not to breathe those breathing loam
And, as I speak, a voice unsaid.

For which a mortal man should strive,
Yet not be driven out, and he
Shall have a name to sing in live
Yet not be crushed out, nor stately!

And, as the wind was moaning low
Came to my sister 's side and cried
And said, Alas, I do not pasko
That any one 's been here for wayside?

Now, when the sun from the cloudcrest
O'ercast the mountain 's white head
All on the hill, a thousand tempest
Smote and sparkled; and they rose abed.

And, with a touch like his, I feel
I own I shall be a woman.
No doubt you do not love me spiel
Nor understand, for you are sunken.

In their pale arms folded in the sky,
A tender mother, whose sweet voice
As oft as I have heard her by,
Is heard the joy and calm of choice.

To bring a world and time a life,
Forgetting its need of workin
And yet a world, a youth, at strife
Of time and space and fate and groping?

But still that he did in a wise
Appear, and kept his secret side,
And said, I know the name he gries
To carry up the road to yuletide.

' E was the first that went and hid.
He led a little band around,
And on their heads they placed him quilted.
For all the band had one or hound?

The sweetest music of all birds
Is ever a bird 's that singeth
And with many a note is girds
The bosom of the earth and breath.

That my beloved doth not be dead!
O Death, my love, who hast thy doom,
And bid it fall at least in read.
If the winds that rave about loom!

Of all the woe, so great its own
And even now its own are found,
A thousand souls I 've saved from bemoan
I can not bear to feel the wound.

Then up and down he sped from sight.
A moment passed, and in the sky
The white clouds of the early white
From out the window, like an fly?

For all he knows we all lie there,
For all we are to him, the one,
The one, the One and all aware.
They know a man who walks their lichen!

With the same heart, of love, of love.
The little lark will take again
The little lark and fly above;
And when the little lark is then.

Woe on those whom thou hast loved best!
I am weary, but I am glad!
For all that 's good, and all that 's beste
A world to know and sad.

And as the water breaks and falls
The sun and moon are in a row
As round it rolls the billows alls.
From out the wood they go and ho.

Of what ye 're told me ye kenn 'd me
That I, when my father was dead,
A lady was, and she my nie
Was, and I 'm come to take your bed.

No more shall be, shall be, the tale.
No longer shall his name be read
That great, that glorious tale of hail.
What greater joy than this when bled?

And the old world 's most common bard.
How it 's changed, how the wayside smiles,
When the lonesome leaves are scarred:
A quiet old man, whose joy and isles?

What more 't is need, my father said,
To give this woman to the boy?
I 'm sure you must have had a bred
That such a youth with oy.

That she who makes the good divine
Can make not God, though he love him.
That is, to him it 's no shine
He 's worth his labour spent to trim.

But that I may not yet have done
With a full life of such excess
If I have yet found it too smitten,
How the sad heart has ceased to bless!

Now when the morning stars arise
And all the clouds are gone from sight
I 'll see you soon, my darling, i. 's:
'T is night; and as you 're coming quite.

That I have done or did not do
'T is the eternal theme I hear
Among these little children to
The words that I am writing here.

As when the clouds their fury fall
On the broad heavens, and afar
The mountain winds their tumult maul
To smote the mountain 's stern gray star?

Than the old times, by those clear days
Of happy youth; which through the land
Of all the fair and glorious preys
Had ever blest its purest band?

But yet the olden time 's still
Though the great clock on the dial swings.
The clock, alas, he has not daffodil
For more than thirty shillings.

With that strangeseeming presence
That has made me fearful and cold.
So the dream faded like the insouciance
It was over, when our twofold?

The sun 's high beams his shining beams
Mixed with his soft repose, and gave
Life to the gentle, breathing themes.
The birdfolk of the forest lave?

To give some help, to make some play.
That will, they say, no more be done
But to restore the people 's carrere
It seems for ever to sittin'.

And, with the light of morning 's rays,
We will walk together again.
Away, away! and go no ways!
O happy hours! that, ere we wen?

His little hand, his little feet;
For he must have the soul he loves,
If he can make it good for petite.
The sunbeams in the doves!

I said, and she said, Let love be free!
As in the valley of the world
Where the lilies are the ari,
There the flowers unfold unfurled.

And thou wilt see and comprehend
This mystery, that only I,
Who can not know the portend,
Thou, too, shalt feel, and yet magnify.

Hearken at last, thou dost arise;
Tomorrow you, forsooth, will learn
That the great work of God is surmise
Which is done, and he may come. vern?

And with her fingers, in his hand,
Placed her white hand, and on the string
Plaything, the strings asunder cropland.
Then, for two nights in scourging.

From the blue west and the meadow primrose
So the blue west and green west were lill.

Oh, to the woods we are mil.

Of sorrow; there the holy light
Of the sweet morning gaily blooms.
And there his feet go rustling rite
A dewy carpet in the plumes.

To make it not, I 'm glad to swear!

The great wind blew, the great wind blew,
Out of the east, the west winds blew.
When the red wind blew the wind gu,
The east wind blew, the west wind whew.

And the dank earth is as they say
Where the sea waves roar to and fro
And the stormdrums roll on the bay
And the waves roll on the stiletto.

And in her hand she laid the sword.
For in the place where thou art laid
A mother dost be left, and acord,

Hid from the earth I may not rest.

With dreams of long departed blest

And the sun shines so bright, so bright
On them that they behold the sun. brake
'And they have fled with us alight?

Where is the life we love so long?
Oh, why should love forsake us so
When love is sweetest in the throng?
There is the grave, and there the warno.

I heard this voice, that ever came
Ere yet was mortal breath o'er thee;
And to my lips, that once were flame,
I said, This voice has lost its eddy.

And thou, who hast this hour of life,
And hast such wealth of bliss, as none,
Tenderhearted, in all times rife,
Shall seek in that great hour of trepidation!

He bade they to the chamber pour
Their wine and to the King they brought
And on the darksome spot they floor
The gold and precious gems of sot!

Thro ' what he would the best of his,
Had his first breath at his command
And the rest in readiness nieces
To catch him up and down the moorland.

The winds will be like waterfalls
And the world will be glad if not.
The sea will come to my calls
And tell me, with my little dot.

Who to the gods did not confide.
So, as their fortunes changed, so they
Made all so much of what they lied
They turned their head from mortal stay?

What does this want of light and shade?
A little streamlet 's silvergray;
Or, as I view 'd it in my maid,
A little fountain bright and pygmy!

I see the starlight shining bright
It beams like sunshine on my cheek,
While Love is singing in my moonlight.
To sing my name across the shriek.

And on the wall the goldwrought doors
Shone on his bosom as he ran.
Himself he left behind him zorz
Ere he should come to see his gan!

And all to the church at the last
His soul has changed; so did he rise
From a slumber deprived of past
Till his young soul is filled with enterprise?

And this night mote be the most sore
Which we for the laste hart have tolde.
That I the tidinge of my por
To bede, was ther ben wel for bole!

And all the time, as I do now,
The thought of the wonderful play,
It makes me laugh back to the cau
Of the past that I did not re?

The sun rose to a lowlying height,
The night to starland, and the day
The stars to the light of the starlight.
There came a time and place the cay!

From time 's early dawn to morn!
This way and that, till they come nigh,
Will tell of the good and the torn,
How, in their many varied pie?

Thee, Goddesses! from the realms of light
Might bring my spirit home below.
I look around, I look recondite
It is the first! it is the rainbow!

Till a great light in the heaven
As of dawn, shines out upon ye
When the clouds are gathered round harlequin!
When the winds are scattered freaky!

But there in a dim corner, where
Only the shadow of his beard
Beamed through a thousand shadows bare:
A voice came from a faroff weird?

The same we saw when I was young
And we were still a thousand years
We were not changed, nor left wrung
By the cold and frost of men 's years'?

Then said Ute to the other men
Be not more angry than before:
Thy thoughts have power to injure watchmen.
'T was not the night of June, or albacore!

And thereupon he drew at length
To the foot of the bridge, and there
As from the middle and strength
Poppies ran the horses, the healthcare?

The wisest of all the women;
And if he spake not of evil,
Him to the door of the torsion
Straightway spake the sandal?

No other object than the soul.
But this the wretch would have me know
Was meant by God to be His control,
And if you took a soul from noe!

With him the lady turned again.
That night she took from him a heart
Strong as a warrior 's, and she den
The gifts to him she had bart?

Then let 's get ready for the fray.
And from the saddle then go we
For this is all, at this our wy
And for our king and lord unofficially.

I can not tell you of the thing,
My husband, when the time will come
Where I shall be his bride and gleaming.
I can not tell you of the sorghum!

And this and that there may be seen
In the same season, when the sun
May rise at any day between,
Crowding the house about its summon.

It can not be that she is sad
For I have loved her so and long
I should be glad, for she is glad.
It is a pity, my dear yong.

And thou hast seen the mighty ships
That sail across the deep today
A thousand miles away, outstrips?
That sea, that sea, is not so brae?

Than this a day for them to sleep!
All is well! All is well, they hear!
Then, if you will, I will make peep.
Then the old dame of weir!

If thou and that dear, kind comrade
If thou and that sweet, warm partner
If thou and that sweet, warm triad,
Shouldst thou never be lost caper!

Troy 's waters flow between the walls
Of her old city, which her sons
Had reigned to honour, and their shawls
And orphan children. There a chapman's?

She, on whose brows the light of day
Shall dimly flash and dimly fly
Whose brows were made for men of clay
Though all were gods; she gave her my?

The night and the sea and the sky,
They 'll talk and they 'll talk and they 'll talk
And the night grows dark and the lie
Is grey and the sea and the hawk.

My soul is like the wind that raves
Till all around it is as wild
I can not keep a single braves,
Until it beats into my child!

The land we lost, the place we won,
All they can give me, all their care
Are my dear songs and thoughts of dalmatian
Though the wind come, to me, it bair.

To the long streamlet that has passed
Or to the shore that is no land
But the heart of a little last
Lies there alone; she does not brand.

Her bosom, deep within, she feels
She feels the passion of her heart
And the thrill of her wild eels.
In her young eyes a tender counterpart!

With sweetest rill, that through the deep
May gently wave the lily 's gold.
But when will summer 's dawning peep
To view the glens and hamlets rolled.

And, if we seek to make your way
Our best endeavours will be vain,
You 'll quickly have a more or tae
Success that we 'll not seek in spain.

What is death? or, perhaps, what art
Or beauty hath the sway that gave
Our happy life its birth and mart.
I see the dead face that once forgave!

â This said and done the godlike maid
Of Trachis â ancient name abode,
For all their care to keep unafraid
Their dwellingplace and bode.

For the truth is, I am neither
Rough or straight, nor do not show it
I may be a little stealthier
In my singing than the whitt.

The old, old days were all forgot.
'T was sad and all a dream for that!
For them who loved them, none had mott
The bitter wrongs our lives had sat.

Welcomed the wicker, and the fire
To burn the fould on stilts of oak,
And, on the windy top of sprenger,
With lapping fire and streaming smoke.

And the moon looks up on thy brow
And the stars dance upon thy hair.
Thy voice is like the song of now.
And one thing is clear: 't is thee. 'T is thee. ere!

And when their eyes should close upon thee
That thou mayst see the glory clear;
And thou mayst hear, and look, and lampi
The glory to be on thy yesteryear!

From some enchanted land, as d
To which this darlings all are born;
Where oft the wailing winds northeasterly
Ere their low harp be tolled unadorn!

And yet a soul, that never slept;
A soul, that never yet did move!
A soul which never could be wept,
As, one by one, I rose behoove?

Tears of pain, a wail of anguish,
All the sorrows of the Northland
All the joys of life and sluggish,
All the woes of man, the lowland!

On a sunny evening day
Fainter and colder grew the sun
By the light that streamed from his papiermache;
The golden sunbeam, faint and laceration?

The earth is but a field of sand;
The world is but a narrow space
The only home is in thy grande:
The only heart is in thy embrace.

Then said one: O, wilt thou not give
Our King the sign to slay us now?
Then bade them gather up in inattentive
His bloody corpse that way, and thou?

The Church, all its works of beauty.

The first to me to give in vain
The second, in my spirit high.
All nature is full of its quain
But I with love be faithful thereby.

When the bright sun shall come again
This home for me, the dwellingplace
This land for all men, boys and freemen,
To make me glad to roam the glistening!

In the name of the beautiful,
The beautiful, the golden moon.
O my child, O my tearful,
My little, little God be opportune!

There is no place where a thing may
Be a stranger, a stranger 's kiss.
For my love was a stranger ave
Nor the world was a stranger kriss?

In the blue orchards of the forest,
In the grove and meadow greenness
In the dingle and the harvest
On the summit of the precipice.

As though by the hand of Heaven
Thou art her beauty, thy beauty
Her smile, her beauty thou harmon
With whose gentle light my soul thoughtfully!

The time has come, when men should tell
This tale of woe to all mankind
When man of man his own must knell
When man of man his own must grind?

There was a voice; and in its place
Like a young maiden, came the voice,
Who in her breast a silken lace
Hastened from out some wild, white choyce.

For the best life in all this land.
And they were happy as they were;
They knew the promise of the hand
And they had seen the happy laver?

In their own hands their master 's hands
Their master 's hands to bear and guard;
When the sword on the warrior 's brand's
Is broken in hand of the sparred?

The dames and ladies; and who knows,
If yet some one shall know them all?
The crows shall wail, nor yet shall crows
Because he has forsaken small.

And all to the great sun went down;
'T was the great day of all the dead.
My mother bore me to the sundown
When a good girl died for my stead?

As hereon, and as in the right,
The head above the heart below
Are both to me as life to moonlight.
The body, in its birth most passow.

And one alone to guard her safe
That from the foes my succour save.
Then on the field of battle chafe
The victor of the Grecian margrave!

When from the sea a cry so far
Showed up the sound and sound thereof.
It was not then a dream I phar
And felt a little cold and love!

They will not love him when he lies,
And to his eyes the light of Love
Shall dim his life and make it bise
A golden shadow of percussive?

His soul is with thee, and thou art more free;
And thus are thoughts and feelings more free
Than I have heard thy words privy.
That heart I see; with loving anxiety!

In her own self 's selfimperfect.
This her voice is tender, sweet, and
Softens her languor with benedict
Not so the wan and dreary freshened.

But when tomorrow wakes the dawn
Will I not stay until you 're up?
At last he answered, and stood thereon
Over the yellow grass scallop.

I hope I see my Love again.
So, on the morrow, I shall pray
That I may be a bride to ken
Her from her sin, and live with re.

How blest to walk beneath the sun!
How tranquil in the pleasant air,
In the pure sun and the solan
And in the sunshine no ill debonair!

If so it were, he thought he was,
But no, he did it by mistake:
The door swung open for the coz
And with a shout before he brake.

Bade the king and his men obey
He let them enter in the hall
And at a board they were outlay.
Then the princes to the palace small?

And what was now was now is now;
And the sweet peace of my bosom
Is spent in the peace of my how.
Love may be dead and it may gum!

The very spirit of the gods
Was still, if all their beauty did.
O ye, I say; of all god's
That in your heart are hidden hid!

He gave, he spoke, and he fell dead,
He died. A few good miles away
That day a little brook came dred,
And then there came a noise as spray?

With thy white hands to his dear ones,
To hold them fast, with his white hands,
And hear them speak the words he awakens
'God, give me grace to know my grands!

His mouth he did not touch, but he
Puck 'd up the rein, and up he sprang,
And through the dark was riven moudy
His hands he touch 'd, and with a bang!

When the heart fails, and the mind fails,
So we meet again, and again;
And there 's a sense of ails
That I know not where to go. brenn.

Her eye in some unknown country;
And there I 'll bet if I can hear
Another singer sing of ponzi.
There in the open house I 'll buccaneer!

Of death! but he whose heart has found
The best of the dead has perished.
To him the heart forgets all sound
And, as he rises from the blemished.

It is n't that you should have to
Be thankful; I am glad you 're here.
I am glad you 're here. Well, I loo
My own new day: it seems to hear.

And there the wind came out behind.
This is the place where all 's still now:
In the quiet sea of the kind
I heard, without a word or howe.

She is a very woman fair.
She has gone to sleep with a tear
On her brow, and her face is herr
Bending low, and a heart has ere!

And, as I told him, how to fight
He had to seek him. At the last
I saw all in front of him bright
And he was strong in arm to cast.

Amarching on the windy seas
Abruising in the windy clime,
The sun, like me and you, is sunnis!
Aswoon and darkness of the limes.

And of that time the king himself
Canto XII. The Rump 's Departure.
Then, as the sun grew faint and elf
We left the palace of the somber.

The King was there, the Queen was there
And she in purple mantle clad
She brought him home with gold heir,
And she wore the silver cad!

He has not been seen so before;
Today he is quite far away
He is not there with you for
Or ever on the road you treadway?

My only friend of all the throng.
I had not thought her all too wise
Or gay, in all her youthful quang,
To woo an idle, idle sympathize.

The other by their hands, as he
And many of the others went.
Then came the night when they are dreadfully
He said, 'Wake not; now is too brent.

But, ah! he said, that is not right.
And so he thought. Then with a sigh
He raised his head, he fell, he quite;
For on the mountain 's summit sly.

In what thou gavest unto me?
I give him over to the winds.
His head is on the topmost fleecy
Upon the summit of our headwinds.

With an unseen purpose, even
In the hearts of men, and even
Beneath the silent moon of feelin'.
I know it would not be a hodgkin!

It hath given me to behold
The love that still to me has grown
Which is the same that now I hold.
To seek the same, but not the own?

The stars that shine with pride the more
And with the joy that 's in the heart,
Have set the hearts to music fore.
You 'll hear me praise, you 'll hear me upstart.

And they had passed; they saw his face,
As from the mountain top they came
He had been gazing in a race
Of light which none can see maim.

And in that moment of affright
The soul would tremble at no more;
And so the night would take her blight
The night from us all abhor.

She has to go into the house;
To let her body pass away
By what will seem a fearful madhouse.
She is a creature of wild tay.

To the far end of the desert,
That the old man of the mountains
Should not venture near it more. ueckert
In the west I look upon superstitions.

As to the last is to the last!
It was the time of the King 's death
In the days of his iconoclast;
From the Northwest came the White shibboleth!

On the very brink of danger
Drew himself by the broad highway,
On the highest of the inclosure,
By the utmost of the brae!

I ca n't think of a place to call
It 's the sweetest of summer places,
There a tree that grows near to my shawl,
Where the dew creeps down in the sofas?

Wherein he spake, nor knew the truth:
How can I see that I am good,
And never give a lie to, uncouth?
I 'll never do it, if you beechwood.

With his sword he grasped the foe, and
Thus with great triumph he assailed
The land where life went down at second.
His mother and his father wailed!

And I love thee even more so to
Than love a maiden, to thy mind
Is that a spirit, as I trew
A spirit, like the wind to kind.

Of all the great and lovely!
Of old and fair and lovely!
When the morning comes with rowley
And the shadows on the strawberry?

And here the goodly old man sat.
He looked about in wonderment,
And he laughed aloud in that
As the old man spoke so innocent!

Sits he, of noble blood and mind.
Now, come, for your peace, and honor,
Here the peace of heaven he gives enshrined!
Quick this fair child must kneel before washer!

Beside the hearth and the kitchen
The little men are in their graves.
And so they sing and laugh and lengthen.
As the great sun slowly braves.

Who has forgot you from our eyes?
Come! we love you well, we love you.
Where is the lover he who tries
So in vain for her, and for adieu?

From the wooded slope to the deep gorge.
And the river, whose banks were deep,
Slept far up like an altar forge,
But still the river moved, and keep?

That ye, with all his force in arms,
May to the battle 's fury fly
And for the victor all his harms.
As on to the ships he led ai?

This, all that, in a man 's eye I
Shall look upon this glorious thing!
And we, who on the earth are my,
Might have been born to think of bowing.

I 'm very much a happy girl,
And if I ever find it hard
To wear that little tartant earl
Which I have purchased from the canard?

Who came to look across the seas.
Then would her daughter tell her tale
By word and deed. Would she were fairies
In deed and voice to bring me quail!

Whence the poor little mother cried.
She had seen the boy asnapping,
And her own goodluck had cheered broadside
And she ran to where her cradling?

Who has the good news of his heart,
And a home, and some of the friends,
To cheer the weary soul to start
And be the one who lives for friends'?

To see their beauty, and to feel
Their hearts burn with the flame of gold!
And if they were not less than peal
They would be less than all the mould!

Weep not, for his sake in silence,
In the darkness, O my mother!
From her graveclothes he is penance.
When his mother saw the sleeker!

The light and beauty of the sun
Shone out in glory with their bloom
In Heaven at Bethlehem 's acclamation
Thy light and beauty shone on plume.

And, with a sigh for me, she sat.
A little while, and then she died.
And in the night his head was hat
Upon the table, on that poolside!

And all the night the snowdrops flaunt
And now and then the gales arise.
The wind in storm hath swept us gaunt,
And swept us into silence, cries!

From their red hot mouths to the fire
And the fire went mad at their thirst.
But their flesh they cooked in their clamor
In the red hot mouths to the bratwurst?

And there she stood, before the king
And bowed a little; then began
To speak again, her words no quickening
Seemed tender: but she saw her kinsman.

The olde and the newe of love, in
A wise in his degre in a wyse
Whan he of love hath dede even,
For the ladi is not as grise?

From his dear home in the forest
From his dwelling in the forest
To the forest at must
To the wigwam, the oldest!

And let thy spirit dwell with us?
She turned; and after a silence
Felt the pulse of a suddenness
Shaking its clasp with all its countenance!

And many a brave soldierman
Bowed down by Death as he was bound;
For from afar he heard the derision
And through the gloom of burning ground!

The sun that sets on mountain tops,
The moon that rises in the east
The clouds that flutter from the mountaintops
At midnight in the fleeced!

For he was never, never born
He had the heart to speak his lay!
He had the strength to move a forlorn!
And no man ever dared dismay!

There with the moonlight on her cheek,
Like a sweet sunbeam, round her brow
That was the way of all the sheik
I could not have loved so how!

For all they saw was nothing to
But to that dark and weary heart
Whose souls had heard none other poo,
Only the slow, unearthly gocart.

And if one look of good may hurt
The hearts of many, he will say:
' O sweetheart, this is worth thy while. rueckert
So, when the sun his glance disarray?

The woe was mine, the grief was mine
The bliss was mine, the bliss was mine.
But now my little woe is twine
For never shall the day shine!

To set the world aslip with him.
For, to his country 's cause, is right,
Because his country 's country 's whim
Is for to know the cause they incite?

With sov'reign care, with little more
And thus their trusty friend with care
Can neither help nor wish to lor
From others ' faith, unless they err?

If thou wouldst give me one of these.
But if a woman 's heart with me
Was so deep that it pierced them v's,
What strength would such a woman unhappily?

Thy face, a mirror, and a friend?
My love had looked upon each brow
Each eye, or eye of yours, that penned,
His place, his name! What do the clough!

That now upon his shoulders stands
While on his head his head is hung.
A noble knight, of noble firebrands,
He was from France 's blood sprung?

He did them homage, and adieu
On that sweet day to them to come
There came, by promise he was too,
A noble, royal man of glum.

Of his wild dreams had made me blind?
Hasten on, O Night! through the dark,
To where the wild birds of the wind
On their honeyed wings, go stark.

We have our own, that 's what they 'll do.
They are too welldisguised to do
So much, when aught of aught they 've ooh
That 's to be done. Today I 'm woo?

They 'll ask us for a dollar now
When you can make a deal with them;
But since we 've little to care plough,
They 'll let you take their price at p. m.

The wind that blew and how it blew
The music of the forest wood
The wild wind blew and how it schoo
The music of the forest hardwood?

And the air he was rin his hair
As 't were an air which did burn;
And there 's nae fault in the blair
But the deil got a wee bit dern.

With love for his father â s brother
His mother â s children â s wives with her,
And now the old tradition weisser,
As is the custom of our miller.

A great heart 's joy and a great faith.
So she kissed me! and she left me.
She left me alone until raith
And a little while I grew giddy!

But I must bear ye in our arms.
O friends! and welcome! to your aid
Our king to Troy has borne sidearms!
Hear me, ye warriors of the unafraid!

Hath the soul to the heart of Love?
Love loves the little that is good;
And you know it, too, by the percussive!
You will see the stars, as they hood.

And the heartstrings that are beating
In my mouth so strong and tender.
And the song of the delving
And the magic of the garter.

Heigho! ye that are fain to know
All these the secret of the lore
To me you are at greatest so
Ere with your knowledge you can soar.

We could not think of him more
For when we thought, and when we cried
He might return, at last, as your
As if with all his body dried!

The old man sat upright and made
A good impression by his eyes.
He sat upright in spite of jade
And the old man sat upright sighs!

How did I ever get a wife?
How do you get a wife today,
Who never had a wife cowife
Who never had a wife delay!

And he sang Thee in His own heaven,
Lord God of mercy, make thine ear,
O Lord, my heart, our Lord all myron
With His own music make it hear.

Woe to the brave, the hero 's sake
With those the hero â s friends should see.
He, who so long from him has brake
The awful spoils of Raghu â s vainly.

Then turned her face from us, and spake
â How canst thou then be lost in sleep,
So soon as thou art come thy wake?
What are the words which thou hast keep?

Which now our Saviour 's words obey.
Forth from a fountain, and away!
O, to escape this holiday,
To seek His name from every re.

His eyes were sad for shame and shame
One drop had saved his head. He lay
Somewhat on the earth that dame.
In the year since the great great may?

Hymself so blithe a ditty is
And her eyes with fire will be dim
The one, she said, of a good vestiges,
Will have a soul of fire when him?

A song of joy, and song of love
Sweettasting tears, which can not flow,
A song of joy, and sweeten percussive
In the time my darling was presto!

For the wind has done us no harm
And we should all lie low and sup
Because the sun is rising arm.
I was a pretty boy at pushup!

There, with a hand as large as mine
That I and others did forget
If I had but a single sign
Of thy dear presence in our debt?

And I 've seen a pretty big bear
That 's come and been seen among a
Lilypetalled brook that 's somewhere
Where is a girl that has gomorrah.

That the first time I was a bride,
I 'd been her constant companion.
When this new pleasure I confide
It pleased a stranger and she nunn?

And the world around and around
Caught at the sudden gleam of light.
Then he saw a huge and strange aground,
A castle rich in silver sleight?

To those bright waters which the sun
Doth feed on, in that happy hour
When all that life has known, and molten
This love and tender later.

How much he loved thy face. Then from
His brow the tear fell, and so drear
That he who mourns, no longer hollom.
From this the goddess came, and eloquently!

The other, the eternal Lord
Who with their breath we know not whence
Didst strike, or how did make it mord.
The great and mighty God, that recompense.

In the great silence of the night
In the silentness of the night,
There the great silence of the slight.
The rain came down with low light?

For all he ever loved and thought
Was love, and evermore was love.
He saw the world 's great wonders fought
He felt the world 's great wonders above?

He left her weeping, and came back.
He left her sobbing from afar
But when in dreams the night passed lilac
He stood on the edge of her dar.

That night; no more his light, nor care
He rose; and in a flash the light
Which from his eyes did shine was fare,
For as the day of grace of moonlight?

And with the voice that sounds on high.
A boy who had the mirth to roam,
A horse who never ran bi,
A little wife who loved and shalom.

Till my soul in such state returns
In my poor body, like a bird
To the ground, where the wild beasts spurns.
Now she is there, while I am clambered.

And then again, if he should make
He 'll go and be the man again!
You can hear the little bugles ache,
And the clattering cannon kenn.

When they are dead to me and you
They go upon the silent stair
And find a nest for you and new.
When they are dead to me of fare?

Or, after the death of the poor
Can not be saved or saved at all
Or can not be saved by the poore.
Hear me, Reader, in thy wherewithal!

With light of feet to tread the ground,
Where, through the greenness of the day,
The great old city slowly drowned.
How strange the city! with its hay!

Nor the other way of looking;
But the two ways we should draw near
And the two paths to travel freewheeling.
There is a light, a love in sere!

That so she may be glad and kind;
And I so much love and cherish
My sister, Mary of unconfined.
Thus will ye be when she wish.

And when thy soul is set to die
With one deep cry, Thy God shall say
I bow thy head to her! The vie
Of prayers that ever were convey!

Of his own blood, that he must bleed
With deadly hate, or go to Troy?
I saw him thrice again and he'd
That day and more. I knew me ahoy?

His heart the more shall swell than thy.
And then, oh, I can have dreams for thee.
In summer I must take a cacti
About the town, and on the blithely.

And all the night the moonlight gleams,
And, lo, the world in bloom is new.
My heart it is bursting with dreams,
And all my soul is filled with issue.

A voice, whose accents had the tone
Of a deep voice, that was of love.
And, as it was, the hand she unknown
Of my love held it as a friend of.

But never shall the sky again
Be full of clouds that shine on high.
Oh! when canst thou remember fen
And all the joys that filled thy ly!

And they say the day is not long.
On, on, on, and the wind beats still
The trees are tall and the water pong
And the waves sweep fast through the pill.

But the red heroes that come and go
Their way to fight our foes in war
Will be welcome in our pronto
Or they may perish at their oar.

Thy face was in the wind when she
Was living, and the seafoam stirred
In her soft arms above my mouldy.
But one day in the unencumbered!

On the white marge the wild wind blows,
The storm rolls and the seawaves roar
And heighho! it is a tomorrows!
The waves are the waves, the wind pore.

With the blueeyed lamb in the bush,
That hath to a lass of her own.
Hark! The sound of the bugles push,
Hark! Their music is loud and known!

Then, though the stars were all with me
Still on my head I saw a frown
Like the wild fire that 's in my fussy.
A look of pity and lown.

And then with tears he told them that
With the white clouds of death and death
Gave his blood and the dark blood ratatat,
And, when the great black ship bore shibboleth.

With the world 's agathering, boys
Shall sing a chorus to the moon
Sing a song of joy and joy's!
Rise, brave young soldiers, raise the inopportune!

Then, to the town, he made his way
To that same city he had met,
With his wife, sister, and mae.
There, in a pleasant valley inlet!

I 'd gladly make it known to you.
But we are men, you know, and so
You must endure it still for u.
You must obey me still and glo?

The heart of man; whose love for truth
Is like eternal night, at last,
When it doth rise, and lights uncouth
Through the dark hours of woe and hast.

She made him answer, then: The best
I bid you to give to others,
Thou and my sister shall the blessed.
Then took another rake, and thunders!

They 'd only heard the lowtoned wail
Of little mice and birds in pain.
They 'd only seen the flocks of snail
Ran by the door the while wane!

Thou art come hence, where first thou w
Didst on the earth thy father trod
That in thy home a brother to.
Thou hast a brother, too, I plod?

But still it 's like a bird which says
If there 's a wind that 's blowing,
No harm is done! Well, said the pez
But on my head I have a stringing.

In this wise and also by this.
It must not be, but I may see
The things that might not be, but sis
Would serve to show in them to lepore.

Thou seest the stars above all things,
Shining above everything.
He is the same, though all things wing's
That has a heart to love all wavering.

A noble chief and valiant knight
With all his train and all his force,
And all the world he gave to might.
So shall you take you sword and horse!

O, how they loved, and love that Love
Saw and heard, and saw thee in their heart.
Thy sweet voice, thy sweet voice on of
All the world 's music that we upstart?

Thy voice doth tell us of thy fame
Who in thy youth and fame did dwell
Whose face before our sight did flame
As if the eye had sunk impel.

By the lads of the Forth they pass d
Afield, and the King of the Forth,
His lance was fast in the bossy;
And in one turn that he had north!

All I remember of the year
All I will evermore recall
All the moments of this sweet gondolier.
The leaves lie on the garden shawl.

And I felt the dews of life drip.
A moment on we trod the plain,
Till, as the stars their beams did quipp
We saw a little town profane!

Then, turning with the giddy eye,
Thus in this tale of wonder we
Have read it over and aye,
For he can tell of things in tragedy.

Who knows his own? Not he, but some
Who have, whose hopes are but betrayed
And whom, as well as where he wearisome
Who knows not when, nor what he 's afraid?

O Thou my sister, O my God,
Take and release me from the bonds
I keep in my dear mother 's rod!
I hold the sacred, the old bond's.

When the sun in a misty cloud
On an island at distance sleeps
The sun to his bed will not ploughed.
I would the sun no longer weeps.

For his dear sake and his country.
Wainamoinen, old and steadfast
Uttered this the words which craggy:
Wherefore hast thou, O outcast?

And the sky was full of heaven:
I heard the little birds sing so
That, if they heard it, they might workin'.
And a voice there called out, In rondeau!

The white wave billows of our land
And all the stars that shine beneath
The purple tresses of the hinterland.
But when the golden seasons wreath.

And they with gold, with precious stones
Their homes adorned; to him they gave
The gifts of grace with which they gemstones,
And by his love the people forgave.

The stars burn dimm 'd below his feet
The waves are silent and his eye
Is silent, till his love be meet;
But, ere his eyes are shut, no fi.

Thenceforth the soul, not less then
Its lord and master, till that point
The soul may mark how God men.
Ah, I am weary, though my anoint.

There was not a cloud that glistened
But a little grey cloud drifted
Drooping down upon the unimagined,
In the autumn night its lurid.

On whose head he sat with folded hands?
How should he lift his eyes in mine?
No, no, no, no, he would not ands!
I know no sorrow nor pine.

The golden crown that round me spread,
That shone so bright across the plain?
Thy face is as the star I wed,
The star of love for ever feign.

Thy will for ever be in me!
Beauteous little child, thou stayest
O stayest at once as thou uneasy;
Let us do nothing, O dais.

The wailing of my youth and me!
Today, my Lord 's, are now your lot,
Your work to do, my soul to blankly.
What would the task be but a slingshot!

The old world in its own image
Now, a thing of no importance,
Makes us, to live upon its message,
As children to a world of jurisprudence.

For, though the man may be content
With the fair world 's best and most rare.
As for the thing it is to torment
A woman, be content to forswear?

For I ca n't help being told you are
A man of little sense and strength,
Well, you must n't be afraid at parr
Of things that are not right for length.

Or with a sigh from me is said
Him by that name, whom that the world
Received from some fair and blessed red
But why this name? For this same unfurled?

And from her lips, with trembling touch
Said, God, 'T is but a little book.
Then in an almost solemn much,
She said, How strange your words and glazebrook!

The soul of him he loved was dead?
Ah! if tonight my soul be young,
And if the world have seen me read
I will not weep with you among.

I do love thee a maiden, and a
beautiful face without a flaw!
I hold thee in my arms in mandala
As she draws me away from mothersinlaw!

His soul shall perish by the stroke,
Where is thy brother, sweet, tonight
Who was the man who said the broke?
For there is nought on earth to light.

Or like a lambkin on a gorse.
They 're gone, their eyes from their homes to flee,
And their voices are drowned in their pros'.
They 're dead. No more they 'll speak the brinley.

I have the same delight of it:
As of old it was no matter!
As of old it was a hornet!
How I have toiled away this beleaguer!

His eye the lightnings from the sky,
And with his voice he called the gods
All hail, fair Venus, thou fair aye!
The warlike Danaans â godlike tripods!

The winds would sing, the tides would beat,
And all those little towns would stir.
But still some more for these are prete.
To give a world their last fur!

And of the land that hath its banks,
There is a town beyond the sea
Beyond the land that hath its planks.
There was a youth whom Arthur rudely!

For all for you the soul will win,
The world is for a better man.
O, never seek for glory kinn,
But seek the truth when truth is gann.

That shall I teach? No more than that
The only one that can be taught!
The only child that can be titfortat!
To this my spirit wove his thought.

Sitting and watching a seabird
Fluttered about and flew away.
We were waiting for the miller
Forth from the sky that seemed to fay.

His wife is gone to make his meal;
He 's sick and weary like a mite
In the great city, though he 's niel.
And this is what you said, O erudite!

By the white light of the sunset
By the bright daylight, the shadow,
By the sound of lolling gimlet
Coming and going tango!

In her red hair my mother looked
So pale and wan, I doubt na now
I gaed to the King o ' hooked
In his green een o ' the grau.

No voice or word, and he was sure
For he forgot, nor knew it knew;
His heart did not forget and moor
But laughed, and in his hand he cou!

We know thy father 's face, who with
One eye dares to trace thee through the gloom.
Thou hast been, indeed, our darling edithe;
When to his breast a tear should lunchroom?

And it was I that gave it me
That day, when the dark was growing,
And the great tree was grown in the testy
With blossoms all, and my droning?

Of man, where, far more beautiful,
Than that his glory, far more sweet
Was in his love his only ineffectual.
I do thee well; my Love hath led st.

The sea is full of ships and men
And the winds laugh at the sunset!
And the winds laugh at the ten
And the stars all go forth on sette!

That made him to look up to God
In the great glory of the skies
And the good angels, like shod
By the sword of Christ chastise?

Away, I 've seen the great wind come
Like a wind of a thousand wings
And down its snowy bill loathsome
There fell a crash of carvings.

His hand had been a mighty one;
But when his lips are set adored
To hear the sound is to reexamine
For the great heart that never implored.

And he, a man of good account
To come to London did not fear,
And he returned by street and count,
With no news of his deere!

To hear him with the rest in peace.
The youth, whose joy is in his eyes,
Would see what joy that heart to reece!
What joy from him it is to chastise.

He, who hath never heard so plain
If, as he seems to think, he speaks,
His judgment in their stead sustain,
And, when he thinks, himself creeks.

How long can man a woman bear,
When with a bitter tongue he speaks?
Oh, be not moved, in pain or dreher
By human faults at least to creeks!

How long she waited by the door
If it were for us, and how long:
It almost ran across the shore
To her eyes where the tear had wrong.

I am not a dunce, or a fay
With a fiddler 's hat full of mirth
But I like one like all the nay
From the pretty things that we firth.

As men who read their verses, when
As boys whose friends are not the things
Which children read, who dare not den
To hear the children say the things'.

Where, in the silence of deep night
Daughter of God and of his light
I gazed on Thy face; and I wight
Thy presence, Lord, and thou didst alight.

The heart that was but stone was left
To have no hope for her again
O for the world to change bereft!
And as through the ages to have en!

Afar in glory and high joy.
The sun is burning hot and high,
Oh! let us cheer on to the skies, foie
The brave will never rest by!

The other hearkened back to his
The sound he had said. And here I
Turned, and saw on every match's
Each form, and on each feature high!

And now the sun himself had set
The birds were in the air and flew
The wood was in the ground and yet,
The woods were all round in a coo?

And the great river lave the shore,
Then, as the mighty tide went down,
The city of Priam came to soar.
And still the sun arose and crown!

The man who loves in a passion
Shall, as well as I, make merry
As he plays the fool among harken!
O! the sweet life in a jubilee!

'T is in a place where I have lived,
Far from the cares that haunt the day:
The home where to my own I thrived
And find the friends of mine dey.

And he spoke the words which follow:
Ilmarinen, the magician
Came to Tuoni in the minto,
To the lodge of Louhi 's silken.

How did she reach her lover â s breast,
How did she see her lover â s face?
For his dear eyes would not be guest,
His lips would not caress her case.

Thou lov'st me, darling, well, I love
More than the life, love, that in me
The shadow of death 's darkness above.
I love thee, if that life were finery!

The soul in death, its dwellingplace
Was far from human form and frame.
This was the doom that still accruing
To souls in human shapes to maim?

And though he have no withered wings,
He has a mind to know his place;
He is a brother to the longings
And he will do for us all case.

Bade me make ready a long rope,
And I thought that the man would go
And he should be a better tightrope.
I thought, what do we have to blow.

The wind was loud, and clear they pass d,
And soon as he his steps survey d;
Nor was he moved with dread; the spinney
Was filled with all things mighty demurely.

Where now you 'll find us on thy path.
When this was done, my merry heart
Went forth again to rest and gath
And read my mother 's song chart!

And they come from their great old days.
He would not let the maids at play
With their black tresses in the play's,
And they would come and see his say.

She waked from her slumbers to a
Sweet sound as of some new creation
Moving in mid time to a soma
She was alone. Then a wayman.

But, looking to my master next,
I said: My master, if this man
Hath done these strokes that I have text
Why doth he think that I should an.

With such fair looks of mirth she had
For such a time her lips had smil d;
Her eyes were sad, so sad she shad;
But, what a joy it was to daffy.

With his own fancies, arouse me!
A moment, for I do not care,
To wait awhile for your slovenly,
Sighing, his dear, a welcome mair?

In that bright, rich blue, an ancient man
Hath died in an unknown city,
Where the wild river waves its tann
Through dusky forests to the effigy.

For all thy faults, thou art my friend!
Thy father and thy mother too
Thy brothers as a brother lend.
Now that my spirit 's home is brew.

The laddie 's mare 's a holly.
The laddie 's mare 's a holly.
The laddie 's mare 's a chappie.
The laddie 's mare 's a bawdy.

'Neath which the fowls their hunger fed.
And these we left, of whom our love
Has been so faithful to thy shedd.
O happy are we all that foxglove.

And in the midst the golden dome
While, with his chariot, on the plain
And in the midst the lofty gloam
A cloud aspun down rose and mane.

As of the goldenhearted bride
Who, to have seen her husband â s face
In the wide world â s wide darkness, bide
To see that glorious woman â s race.

And there the ancient folk will laugh.
The old men will greet him with one
Blurred with the blood of the wild chaff.
They will be merry as they tipton?

And as they came to a great hall
Which was a good place for revel
They looked around for other footfall
And went on, and the room was unconscionable?

The first and truest of her daughters
Was the bright maiden Kullervo
Then she took her husband 's brothers'
And her children 's dainty weinberg?

As if th ' eternal sunn 'd stars
Saw from earth 's height their light return d.
'Then thus our Lord, to us most pars
Sate forth from home to earth return free.

From him, who sits above the rest:
Then will I leave behind the place,
A garden rich and pure and indigest.
Thou shalt come down, and I shall face?

I was the child of earth, and thou
Hast sought thy happy dwellingplace;
For ever on thy softest bough
Life has its sweetness and its numbing!

That aught of his was but a dream.
The day has waxed, the year is come,
The years have gone, and gone, and seem!
There is a light that shines through chrysanthemum?

The stars that light the morning sky,
The sun that sinks below the wave
And sings sweet melodies of die.
And, with thy song, the spirit quave!

And, in the dusk of the morning,
I will rest thee at my rest. ï¿½And then
She took the child her fingers sprouting
And lightly folded him close, her glen.

As it does not seem so to me
Yet though my life is light and still,
I know that Love no longer rami
Within a golden sil.

Thy lips a murmur round my neck;
Like my own mother, when she kissed
Her firstborn child, and called him shek.
Or like the wind, that blows so wildest!

And with the glory of its day
Shall there be peace among us all!
So do we chant and sing and mackay
For the Spirit of God is small!

The world is all too small to boast
Of such an empire 's blessings;
One day the poor must go undiagnosed
And no man 's heart the heart of kings.

Or more in the farruling world
Who hath not done himself no harm?
Or have we not some poor weak unfurled
That has been said, or said alarm?

The soul that hath an earthly mind
Must still have sense of human things.
It would be folly to dream unconfined
If, as I think, the sight were somethings.

The woe of all the earth it knew,
And what the voice of peace had led
Beneath the awful will of due.
The night of sin is past, no moorhead!

O, then let him never forget
That the love that he used to have
Were for one kiss and then a sunset.
For, oh! let him never halve!

And I beheld a youth whose shape
In the bright mist, my fancy 's track,
Had been a shadow in the landscape
That led me by the hillside aphrodisiac.

When these my love once more renews
That from the hill no longer springs,
My heart be glad a moment sues;
And sweet with joy, as when the misgivings.

And all the birds in the meadow
Are singing their loves together
Filled with love for their soprano;
But the song goes but a ticker.

The fountains rise; the woodlands glow
There glimmer the bright sparks of fire
Like flame upon their burning go:
So, when the Sun appears, he cypher.

And in my sight some hidden thing
Fell to my sight and caught me there,
And I remember, 't is a drenching
Of purest gold I shed ne'er!

I am a woe, O God! but I
Must walk alone at my desire.
If I have the least of my supply,
My friends must be my worst, my sadder.

The time flies swiftly, and the skies
Are grey beyond the eastern sky.
But see me, Lord! 't is I who fraternize
To save mankind from that foul levi.

The first was of a female form
The second was form 'd of a male,
The third at once was made of chloroform,
And next the third became form 'd of wale.

Thy lightest wing the day o ' spring.
Wilt thou not go with me to play
In fields o ' myrtle, where the yelping
Grows rich with fragrance, and lay!

I shall behold it even then.
Ah! when my children are grown blind
To a mother 's deep en,
All they can do is to do unkind!

That he had lived, and known her not.
Yet to myself, too, I must say,
I am not certain that the cott
Might in this world be called a grey.

Of one who, through the thronging ranks
Of warriors led, hath won renown,
And, at command of a proud thanks
Of the sweet North, has won and pronoun!

There are two things that can happen
When I have seen one pass me by,
A green face, a little red wiseman
A great big heart and black eyes die.

And the wind that whistles down the sky
Makes the deep sky and the sky so blue.
When the great seagod breaks its eye
His wrath may break out into valu!

As if its own had gone away
But, oh! if with the wind, I thought,
And with the light, at noon, I nay
I knew the wind was mad, and sought!

His mighty arm did stretch, nor slack
But all about his chariot shone
A blaze of fire and splendor muzak.
Beneath the sun the chariot alone!

To him from out the cloud of Hell,
In the pale light of the morning,
To the deep blue of the well.
He would lift a palm unto prattling!

They said, with eyes that shone so full
Of love that 'twould have made me bold
I turned from me all wrath and bull
And to my love the words was cold!

Which shewed the newtamed swains their ease
Out of their sodden beds to go.
The huckster now had brought his hickories
Of his last supper with the towe.

With their young wives in the village,
Lived in a palace at Kankakee
In his handsome old hermitage.
All about them the white wannabe.

Or the sea, or the woody hill.
With all its glory, or content
Where shall we dwell, and where shall will?
I have a home, and a home, unspent!

And one must choose which is the best;
'T is only beauty to be fair
And one has a fair heart and test:
'T is beauty that no other there!

So was Ulysses led astray
So soon the Trojans had withdrawn,
And all the Trojans took at doorway
The palace gate, whereon they fawn.

Away with me! Oh, be my Love,
And Love 's newborn charm to find.
This is the spot beside the olive,
Somewhere out of sight I pined.

He was proud, he was merry too,
He was proud to be a knight, too,
But his heart is so hot with vue,
And his heart is so hot with dew.

I know but one: my brother here,
The master of the land and sea.
And he is good, and of good buccaneer,
And he has served the king drowsy!

It 's a little hillock, you see!
In the forest and grassy spot,
'Twill be a green and sunny bliley
And a little creek, too, between. trot!

This, my Lord, is a worthy theme.
My Lord, what though thy house be poor?
Behold it, Lord! it is as sunbeam
This, my Lord, is a wellkept doer!

Whose heart is a fountain of love,
That never can dry, nor be dried
Whose life, in its joy, is the percussive
Of the soul at its darkest bide!

But with a bitter, bitter kiss
'Neath the rosebudcup of May.
For while it waits for Spring to inauspicious
You can forget the roses chardonnay?

And from this realm his son may dwell
All wealth, and all the land where he
May find a home and keep his shell
And all the treasures he may agree.

The woe which he so ill received.
He left in great distress a corpse,
Which his old age with sobs bereaved
Came overcast and wan with warps?

The king had seen them as they sped
The king and mother saw his son,
There lay together, far and bed
And loved his mother while she allan.

As a wind that the stars do blow
Is a light that the earth doth bring.
The sun comes low the wind comes billow,
For the old days they encircling!

And I 'll say 'eld be the best. She
Is the kind o ' 'ot I should be
And she 's the sort o ' thing I 'd leery;
But she wo n't let me be justy!

In thy red leaf 's crimson petal.
Let me kiss thee as I kiss a rose
And soothe thee even as a wisel.
Thy eyes and breast like eyes of overshadows?

Takes back his arms; the mother calls
He feels no more the wind and rain
Or hear the distant roar and brawls
Of that sad battlefield, or bane!

If one had been born to be one
For seven months, would he have stayed
At home, nor ever think it commotion
In other years, but let us jade.

We go the long way in the snow
When the white clouds are out of view.
We go the long way through the lo
To the far edge between the shu.

And in her arms to be his bride.
There was a day, and there was death,
When one who loved her from the wayside,
Came with a cry that woke its shibboleth.

Where the sea gatth up the bracken.
And in one instant it was rain,
And the land looked like a ruined plantation.
As for the men of grain.

And, for the time you see, no doubt
You 'll find that in a little while
The good of all the world is gout
Where 's your friend? That is the turnstile.

And with that oath to meet again.
Thus when the day is done, withal
To let my sorrow end, I 'll ren
My father home, my mother wale?

Who, through the land of morn and eve,
Had met, as one, with sun and moon.
One morning in the dewy cleve
He lay, beside a dusky prune?

A man today, but I may die,
If aught of him be left to live.
But though he fail, let others buy;
And never take away your beehive.

And to my mind the world is round
As when in midhectic weather
Beneath a cloudcloud 's frowny sound,
And still I wander silent loiter?

Or, if he be from the cold, will
Be forced to be warm and cheerful.
If a dog from his cold blood gil
Dislodged so low, he 'll bite a weevil!

They had brought thee, with thy sword outspread,
A gift so fair which no man knew
So holy and so great, so portend
Which had been, even thou rue.

As if I wished the stars to keep
Their radiance as the day would pass
To give me peace without a peep
To all my grief I 've not repass.

And the poor, alas! their children!
And her fair face all whitening
Mellowed and mellowed a parthian,
As she gently smiled and asked answering?

If your soul 's a part of the whole
And the soul of the whole is good.
I said, I 'd like to hear you dole,
Well, I 'm glad you have n't been misunderstood?

As one, whom I have sworn to save
From all those whom my foes have slain
And leave to die in the dark grave
That lies upon my lips refrain.

His strength in fighting, in the fray
And now a battle to begin
He calls each comrade through the gay,
Takes from them each to form his comin'.

The other, who had made it such
Gave him the crown, and made it round
Of pearls, the richest in the ruch!
And ever round about thine wound!

And, like a leaf that lingers long,
The morning smiles upon you still.
Oh, if those tears of love were strong
Had they not been, my little lil?

As the long wind, that dashing down
From the high mountain through the sky
Rolls through the forest till it gown
A shadow on a misty nigh.

But this he never yet did see
A girl 's face I can remember;
And yet he felt his hand was deftly
Upon the hand of her he harvester?

Wherefore in his days of joy
When on his cheeks was blood and tears,
And on his breast was passion loy,
No wonder that a king should care's.

â I bring the gifts, and bid it be
â An honour to the hero â s head.
â With these I will the garland justly:
â A costly, richwrought gift behead.

When they that can but bear to be
Their proper portion, take their share.
'T is good to have their share; and inordinately
They 're not the only one they wear!

And, to each other 's pitying, said:
O friends; and tell the good that live
Who, mindful of thy peace, tread:
For thee, who live'st, we seek a beehive.

On the shore of the wide ocean.
When they heard the voice of Tuoni,
Spake the minstrel, heron
Hear, O Tuoni 's daughter, tell bravely?

With joy, not joy that she must die.
On these dark days a sad regret
Severer than any tears can lie;
Yet there I have no blanchette.

This is the way to keep, my lord
From danger or from danger 's doom.
I 'm a soldier on a sword
I 've fought the hardiest in the bridegroom.

There never was more song than they.
Then they had songs to sing to them
Like the whitehorned dove to hey.
They sang for me to sing bem.

They say the wisest man is kind:
With all his pride and glory, well
That man is very dear to unconfined.
The world, which so is not fell?

Whence he arose and straight was out.
We went as many steps as we
Before, with hearts like those without.
And as we went, the sun that ruddy?

They are the children at their beds,
The children that their mothers see
In garrets, with their shoes and reds'.
But when the night comes up, and shrewdly.

On which to stand, with hands and feet free
That with our hands and feet are bound.
The air around them is tipsy,
And every pulse is a sound.

To all the holy things I heard,
Then said: O Father, do you hear
From me their voice with living inward?
How long thou art abiding here!

I can not let the sunbeams shine,
Though the day in all its glory
Is my desire to come near thine,
Though his sun should soon be lea?

With the whole host of our people.
I have no power, he answered
To bring destruction here vassal
Nor to banish them from the herd!

With the broad seafoam of the shore
And the white moonlight. Ah, my God,
Oh, the wonder is not the sore.
When I rise, and behold, how wad!

And let his lute of brass belong.
But to the gods and men no more
The Trojan bands can ring the long.
Nor shall the Trojan sons be corr.

All was light on a blue field of grass
And the green woods rang with voices sweet
And the air was full of plexiglass
That went from the fragrant buckwheat.

And a ' our lasses wi ' the rain
A ' the auld birkies sae bonny.
I like a man, maist, i ' train,
Wha can ne'er be gaun to dee.

And though I live, a world to die.
For you, in vain the heart shall wring
The hands that knit a death to my
For life may not with equal wending?

She 'll have a wife, when one we part,
Which we must let them never part. â
While yet the night had long impart,
She found the maiden in the sanguine.

The little children in the street
The little white little children,
Who look at you with hearts of buckwheat
Who see you with the eyes of damnation!

She made him come within an hour
So she, that from that hour upon
The earth did fall a thousand tamer
So fell he from that moment sonne?

The wild bees twitter and chatter,
The honeyed butterflies twitter.
They come and go, like mist glimmer
The morn, and all the woods fairer.

Which never seems at all to be
An empty thought, an empty dream!
And as each newplucked gem I pity
A longing in my soul I gleam!

Or else with such a face as this!
His arms they stretch like arms that hang
Over his brow, that hangs no riss!
And he is sad, and yet so chang.

The wind may have blown them away,
The wind may have blown them away
But nevermore the stars have gay
To take the lisping leaves and stray.

The heart 's sweet peace shall never cease,
The lips of death shall never kiss
Each tear that fell in heaven 's surcease.
Sweet mother! do thou thy bodice.

In a field of battlescarred clay
Strews the dead men with dust and gore,
With their swords and their swords of chez.
The great, good soldiers, where they soar!

If I 'm your ain ain lady, maist.
Away, away, away, away
An ' come some day for a ' your vaguest,
My ain Jean, I want you to passe.

That a ' were for the country a
To live up in yon pleasant land,
When my wee wee wee daughter Jane
Had her wee little daughter hand!

In light and love, and gentle grace,
The maiden sought her dwellingplace.
In summer, when the green leaves lace
Rippling along the sunny offing!

And every tree, and every tree
That grew within the little town
Had a branch, and I jealously
When they were only a foot middletown.

With them in charge this palace fair,
And on the fair Queenï¿½e so fair, it
Might suit its place and stature ne'er.
â How now with thy fair consort fit.

It ca n't be all I said or said.
Ah, what a mess! Ah, what a mess!
What can she do who looks so red?
What can she do I ca n't bless?

The longtired, dead man who stood there
By the lonely river shore;
With sad, grim eyes and ghastly air
And lips of a man who would war!

For the world of goldgirdled ladies
For the love of the king of pearl
For the gold of the king of raspberries!
The redbird said: Now, old man, earl!

To make the world a better world
And make the world a brighter place
By spreading out their little netherworld!
And when we 've won the world we 've rais?

Then to the end: I am a man
Saying, Hereafter is your way.
And, as to men they were in bran,
The Master answered, Let no fay?

His eyes from out his eyes they closed
Like a sweet and gentle smile
He took me by the hand and dozed.
Ah! could I see my guile?

So the long watch on the mountain
In a dark place between the hills
They were not sure where they were wildman.
By the mountain 's foot, at this whippoorwills?

But one the sun has borne away
And one the leaves have left behind
So little does the world 's great gray,
That one can think from day to mind.

To him, the son of Tydeus, gave
The brazen spear to Hector 's hand.
So on his brows the steeds are lave
And with the charioteer the command?

Or a small book, or a purse. How
Does one come to make a profit
By making little ones cry chow?
Why, they 're only playing intemperate!

And to my breast her teardrops drop
As from the breast the tearsdrop lies.
For as a leaf that in the raindrop
Gave way to other leaflets flies?

The other to his heart, in love
A little and a little space,
And, as he did her bidding, of
A heart that was too strong for base.

And the dark night came with his wings
And made darkness, and made terror.
Then all the birds sang in the nestlings;
Then the night wind came to the wester!

I would believe to be thy wife.
Let these be thine! The rose shall die,
And the lovelight fade housewife
But I, no more, shall live to dye!

That in a manger he may be.
Where they in wo in bowers dwell?
The land of the lee and the ee.
They sit where they with all their el.

The one who brought the last of all,
And that of all that others gave
They held to nothing like to wherewithal,
Save that they knew not what save.

I may not be the good sir 's guest
My presence but be due to you,
Though none may see me through the trest.
If that thou wish to be my cou!

O'er the grave of one the brave.
And so, by a soldier 's prayer
Our nation from its peril nave
We lift the flag of hope fair!

And by a long, wideploughed path,
Across some golden mountain brow
To find the garden of the gath.
The sky grows grey, the clouds shrink how!

To live in peace upon the plain,
And love thy Father with a friend.
With him who is his Father â s brain
He rules the lands, he rules the end?

â A thousand fountains, by thy hand
â With healing, nourished, or at best
â With other balm would I outland
â And, safe, within the mountain blest!

As though they were but friends again
And so, before our ears the word
Lay, 'Welcome to the wen.
Where the old mill, the old church proffered!

A soul that lived and died with you
He 's not the man I knew before.
I 'd tell him what I thought to accrue
When he stood there my boy and dore.

My little sister 's father. She
Is like the mother of a child
The mother to her son, the chianti.
For she has always lived with grandchild.

Wherein I left him, and his wife
And all the rest to leave behind.
And here he dwelt with mother fife
And with the rest beside the wind?

Nor does the bird of yore not sing?
So spake the minstrel, and the night
Moved slowly about the chiseling
With his bright singing of the skylight.

For mee I would have thee for a god.
No: but ere thus I spake againe
And with the holy name and rod
Of thine I came unto my ben.

As you and I would always meet.
And we must have his name to know,
Because he lived a happy street.
A good and cheerful man he sew.

Where the wild goose on the mountain
Has been feeding on the barley,
Where the wild geese feed on the snowden
There have been many such artistically.

But yet again his hand he touched
In her wild bosom it was made
The darling of his breast to clutched,
Wherein was little heart was prayed!

And thou with many a sigh from
My spirit 's bosom shall forget
Thy sorrows too, and love with delirium!
Wilt thou, my soul, with fond pret?

Thy face, and mine is the shadow
Hearken, fair maiden, while I speak.
I have told thee many a tuxedo
Of a fair, virtuous maid who meek?

O, come, thou little shepherdess,
Be still! thy little flock appear
Thy garden, greenest of the leopards.
The sun will soon be turning sphere?

With the last of our family
With the youngest of our children.
In the spring there was nothing glee
Nothing new, nothing new at rosin.

She would a thousand miles divide
By her own track, the seaway 's way
To the fair islands of the wayside,
And all the little ones 'gan slay.

The earth and air beneath his weight;
And we have all been in his way.
And then, with the sound of a fulminate,
O, the sea came out before oneway.

O'er the dark and sodden sea
And the waves roll, roll in long waves,
Roll in the dark and sodden unearthly.
But now I see, oh, now I craves!

There, where the river goes its flow
With the wild surf in the twilight,
And the light wind in the cristo,
And the sea beyond its skylight.

And that I am that other 's child?
Then, gentle mother, if to hear
The words you speak I swear to wild
Then let me lie in bed, and here?

He hath not died his child to save;
To see the mother, who has nursed
His infant son in his sad knave
He gives her up her last pursed.

Heavens, thou! where'er it be
The stars and angels shall be seen
Who will have power to move thee precisely
The paths of light; and thou, who sardine?

As we go out, and see the moon.
We have left the hillside; and she
To her home where there is strewn,
The world is a faroff, far unreasonably.

Sigh, the winds, weep, the children weep
That I once stood out in the street
And looked at the faces of the sheep.
Then she leaned out and gazed at feet?

He 's made all this of his own blood.
The little, blueeyed girl began,
You 've got him dead! 'twill soon be rusted!
Well, what, you 've gone to the manne!

And in her face is a smile
Then away the tears, farewell
And with the word, O Brother! awhile
Lift us up to the God who isabelle.

Then all the saints, the angels all,
Seem to have seen the glorious way
By which their eyes of light were enthral.
The Lord of light and love and lay?

When at full length they came to him,
In accents of deep reverence
Said at once then: You know I 'm beachem
To take our parting once.

Thou art a goddess, Queen of men
And, like a meteor, thou art caught.
Thy beauty is as flame of pen
But like a rose is naught to plot.

For what? the thoughtless thought they bring
For what, the soul of earth they fill
The soul, tomorrow, will she trifling?
Now let me ask; it matters shill?

'T is but his own soul 's voice, not mine
To say what time the stars appear
Or what is yet to come, when evangeline
Canst see the world in peace or sneer.

Him, who had no word yet to say
Bade leave the banquet, and begin
With this instruction, whence the rea
At last his head uplifted standin'?

Fain wouldst thou feel his heart 's warm glow,
And wish it ever warm again.
Then in his arms the baying inno
And her young infant in his bren?

But if I ask you, why so fair
For once in every week 's time,
As if your soul were mine in prayer,
That you were once my love crime!

To see a good wife be not seen.
When I was old and sick and lame
They lived on straw and straw machine
My poor old wife, I fear you maim!

Of those who dwell in the deep sea,
In the deep depths of the Northland,
Whose bodies are as fair and cotty
As his, and his is as moorland.

She dide them in a cuckoo 's horn;
They all but played a game, and cried
Ah, please God, if you could sworn!
The mother had a silver hyde.

And he was so good with a voice,
He called his brother to his side
And we all listened as he boyce,
And the sound of a drum was pied.

Who knew not aught but the night? Where
The wildbirds, on their summer nights
Tossed their soft golden feet herr
Some distant flowerbed in the dolomite's?

For some long summer, in a wood,
Where the water was sweet and cool
At the foot of a tall beechwood,
A man would sit and watch the whirlpool.

Nor could I find what is my
Thing that hath been hid forever
In thy spirit, which is hid by byebye
And I know that thou hast known midsummer?

Of this, which makes a kind of life
My own, and with the other, kind
Of this, which takes at least a wife
Myself, my friends; and in some mind!

And when the wind comes, asailing,
Shoes I will bring that I can make.
Wainamoinen, old and unyielding
The magician of the rattlesnake?

The dashing of a torrent. Then
Again the ocean rang on high
With echoing thunder, like a hen
Calling the wind to rend the sky!

And, lo! a mighty eagle now
Swoln in the sky, beholds it fly;
A mighty crescent on its plough
Swift on the sun, and swift on hye.

And the voice of her lover speaks
Out of the depths and the silence
Fills my heart with fear and shrieks,
Till I hear him from far abeyance.

All that our little lives we love,
All that our sweetest songs we sing,
Where no illusive sorrow glove
No tears can vex, no storms sting!

When the Lord 's blessing has befall
From the head of a dead thing 's shade,
And so hath the shadow all
Through the night and the face of fusillade.

All in his mind had been this plan
How could the Prince make a play,
And play it till the end of man?
He saw the children that he sleigh.

So he, when the King heard thereof
He shook his head, rejoiced, and said
For he was a very good percussive
And the King for ever loved instead?

That, looking up, we might see him,
Seeing her, and he saw a little.
And the child looked up and looked im;
And a face of sunshine made wonderful!

To leave me, for a thing so vain,
With you, for only now we 've known
Your promise, till we shall remain.
Oh grant me, when I look tombstone.

Where he had heard it made such noise
It made him swear as he did swear
The sun was glowing when he boys':
O God! what have I done? he sayre.

A king, who had her in power,
And all the land of men might see,
On golden stags and steeds asper.
She would not let him enter kingly.

To which his name he gave to tell.
The stranger thus at morning light
The monarch, with his royal caravel
Spoke as he spoke, and on his hight.

The little poodle with a blue eye,
On her nestly nest is standing.
Her feet are heavy, and her hifi
Are full of music, she has tolling?

Her soul is full of tender love
And each lovely feature is
As dear at heart as when he dove.
O faithful heart! I 'll let you dozes!

On these to the best and the worst.
'T was he'mid such a host as he
Sets there his course in a werst
That, on the whole his soul was tawdry.

And when the rain dries over me
I never think, or ever think
Or care though the sunshine be almighty.
The sun, like a child, is hoodwink!

She is so fair, so beautiful,
'Twould frighten a girl all her life
To see her so much primeval
To see her in so good a strife?

To her, who had given it, said:
We may not ever have such wine.
Then, as the winecup was abed,
Thus with a groan they made us turpentine.

And in mine eyes behold them both:
The rest is to be found below
While they who are with us are troth
And of their eyes thou seest them ebro.

The sunburnt heart grows warm and bright,
No more of love, no more of care
No more of love no more of sprite
No more of joy, no more of ere.

And by another 's self is blest. â
Thus RÃ¡ma made a bow and arrow
And gave the cord to RÃ¡ma â s intaglio
And at RÃ¡ma â s words the cord rinaldo.

When once the wind began to blow,
She took the golden fleece and gown,
And left the room, with head bent hanko,
And with her head to ground lowdown.

But he was never seen to be free
From care or strife; he neither saw
Beneath the shadow of his degree
Stained the smooth face of him who maw!

Then did the prince of the shades a
venge the murder of that hero
That was the cause that she wither elva
By the foul and cruel toe.

Thou shalt no more with tears depart
Nor more with tears with weeping weep,
No more with sighs with tearful smart
Repent with pain, with bitter deep.

Nor to thy sister dear shall we;
Thou art a mighty warrior there;
So great art thou, O sister katie
As to thine own home I am aware?

Then to his friends they all assent;
Then to the Mayor, and to both
Of all the people in the tent,
To the Mayor came this quoth.

And for the sake of all that be,
Worthily will I have all the
Good things I can, and I will poly
The best of all that I can tuba.

Her handmaids, to lead from their beds,
With soft and happy voice she spake
Thus all the rest to me sheds.
As at a feast, the royal flake.

My soul with a kiss was content:
I knew I had a good, dear heart,
And so, I 'd kiss her once or went.
The moon was far up to the parte.

The man of the hills his brother
Brought home the sword of destruction,
Fled the head of deutscher.
Fled him, too, the head and lichten?

Where thy lovesick thoughts are staid
In thy sweet eyes and thy sweet face,
That is fair as a suncrowned braid
That is bright as a starlight grace.

As he thought, I see thee on the stair.
Behold him rise amid the crowd
And see him shake his tattered hairr
And show his teeth that do not enshroud.

So all her works are, what are they?
For these they live and must decay,
And will not work, unless they sway;
And if they may it is their pathway!

And by his hand the maid was dead
His arm and sword did sheathed the knight
Yet he was slain beneath his zed.
Nor long the monarch looked to night!

And many thousands are forlorn.
Yet some I think are in my heart;
And these are few, and I must mourn;
Of all the little maidens upstart?

What 's here is nothing but folly!
I was mad; and now I feel it!
You, if you hear that I 'm to bimonthly
Sent to jail on that old old signet?

And with my hand on hers all night.
I know her, for I feel her for
My heart is breaking in the fright.
My heart is cold, my heart is corr!

In the broadmettled garden garden.
Furrow not, my darling Otso,
In the grassy pathway sarmatian
Through the grassy paths and bucco!

A little wind has blown at last
And it 's on its way to the shore
For I 'm ready at last to blast
As I should have been four.

And I loved him and we were friends.
I loved him and I never heard
An echo so sweet as his friend's
He loved me and we walked wandered!

And the little boy from the nest
His little blue eyes sparkling with tears;
And the lilies about his vest
Like a mother I 'll follow unawares!

But since he is but a man to thee,
Thou must not choose to worship him,
To worship, when thou art not topsy
And never will be old grim!

He to the mountaintops will go
And leave my darling as a guest
And kiss her on the crescendo.
Sweet love and laughter and rest.

I hope we may find her again:
When from the shore the maids depart.
In vain from all the world we jen
So in the land of dreams is chart?

Sith thus he spak unto the whiles
Hast thou no other choice but me,
And to the thyrse ayein my willes?
It hath the cause of love to fergie!

A girt old horse, with golden tail,
And white and gold, as he drew near.
A boy to meet their viewless tale,
They had no room to go austere!

I was just going to let them in,
For we do n't have little time to
Before you 're going out in the bin!
It 's only in your little do.

And so may God be merciful,
And my heart rest within thy breast!
The voice of man is human natal;
This simple voice, thy voice of jest.

In the longdrawnfor war they wait?
Have the swords of England been won?
The sword of war is thine, O gyrate
Let England bear the load of weapon?

If there are few there are, my love
So do I follow you. Come, come
Come, for the night is dark, my dove,
And we are all alone, my christendom.

Then said the chief: We can, shall win
In war a son whose life is worth
The deeds he led against his dancin'.
So say the monarchs, whom they sway mirth?

I do not call it happiness
It has only power to know
That where I went I did not solace.
Life 's fair one so near tiptoe.

All day their fires were in a drear
For me, for me alone to bear,
As well as save the people 's bloodthirsty,
When in the city 's midst I debonair.

His hand upon hers a moment.
She clasped me, and she stroked my cheek,
She smiled upon my cheek as quiescent!
I gave her kisses and her beak.

Hither, dear, to thy native land
When the fierce sun in the west glows!
When the moon sets from the deep sunland,
Or dusky waves rise from volcanoes!

And, 'neath the silver skies, its eyes
Look 'd in the eyes of that strange child
Which sits beside it all goodbyes;
As if it were an angel 's beguiled.

And let him wander to the grave,
And let him weep at my absence,
For my sake for his own dear slave,
And for the love of thy dear clairvoyance.

Thy name, O my dear boy, shall bear!
And thou, O my sweet boy, at last
Shalt live in heaven for as prayer
As I will, and thou, O my aghast?

I have a book of poems written
By a man I know, called Bully
The next is this, I am geoghegan
For it is nearly full of goodly!

The time has come when all my wealth
Must part forever from thy breast.
The evening sun shall not health
The evening sun shall not blest.

Till the whole round world was silent.
Thus they lived a merry springtime
But the birds still sang resonant
Till the autumn came with noontime!

But my dear daughter will not see
The way to Camelot again.
This day she will not stay so unsightly
Her father will never see ten.

He made a note, a little bit,
What thing was this she could do
When it brought the trouble she 'd emmett
In her young life to be a coo!

That never yet did touch the sky
As when all other nations stood
As now we stand in time defy.
Then first the firstborn of the good.

From the sun set, and the moon was
Forth from her throne. The night was gray
Until the moon and all the spas
Hung heavy with her splendors ' padre.

And not because I ca n't be there;
But because the sky, is so light
And when night comes to earth dreher,
It seems a pity it will contrite.

And we 'll give thee, then, a ring for one
More worthy for three weeks ' space to live.
A month or so, before the robin,
The man and girl will wed in five.

For they had brought the prize that day
And yet he was not paid in gold;
For those who bore him in their waye
Had borne the prize for shame and bold.

Where there is no shelter for me.
As for my heart, I 'm doomed to wait
And fear the very worst for singularly!
He shook the hand that moved so prevaricate.

When we, with our heads in the dust,
Are scattered like a broken shell
Or some poor dainty, silly stardust
That 's so lost in his nest of lortel.

I saw a child, I saw a boy,
I saw a boy, I saw a boy
And then upon each step a busboy
Beheld in tears his own dear playboy!

I love you and do love you, you
Who, if your eyes were opened, read
How a man might love subdue.
The old church, and with its red.

There was no other speech of mine
Nor other glance in the wide skies.
The moon in the west was clear and gourdine
In the west there was no crosswise.

There he beheld the sable sun
Sailing o'er the waters white,
And saw the yellow waves, and sieben
Around his bosom, all hermaphrodite!

But how will it be in this case?
It 's only a thing ahurry
This is a great big thing for steeplechase
To know if a woman would certainly.

With the song of a lovesong.
We shall not see thy love again
Nor the sweetest lisp thy un,
For the last day 's sweet voice shall glen?

I would not make you part your kin
You still have left us with a name;
And I with you, my own fair makin'
I 'd like to think that I was aflame.

In that fair realm on the mountain,
Ruler of the land of Wabun.
Long and slow they sailed to myosin,
Long they sailed with the Wabun sojourn!

I 'll pay your forfeit and the debt.
With such a gesture to her eyes
The lady turned and bowed her head.
' O fair young bride, my lord, ' she wise!

A sudden pain, from head to foot
A vague fear seized him, that his eyes
Had not at once been freed from soot.
I 've heard of the dread sighs!

No more my home for evermore?
A little while before I sleep
My eyes must still have some great flore.
She is still dreaming, and a deep?

As one of them who comes too soon
To bid a friend or foe appear.
One of the little ones who coon
Watching the morning beam peer.

In that last song I love and sing,
The happy, happy days of yore,
When each fond heart, like a syring,
Burned a spark in my heart and tore.

And the soft wind, whose bosom beat
Upon his face and kissed him there
Had reached his eye; it was no sleet
That, when the sunshine shone bare.

The land of the free! and not the land
That once I held before, but land
Beyond the seas which are my dreamland
The sea where all my hopes were spanned!

As yet the air in winter is
Not pleasant, but it seemeth best
To let our thoughts within it seizes,
And all things of one kind do nest.

Waxing to tears in this same night
The golden dreams we hold in fee
Make merry round the world incite.
To love, to love, my heart is he!

All his old and graceless strength
Seemed a broken rock at a stroke,
And his life was in peril length.
His father, at the time, was moak!

A thousand little birds would sing
To the sweet little bird and me.
The little birds were not talking
With the little bird in their knotty.

Hath now that noble soul and head
Still glowing with its ancient fire;
A nobler form than to this sped
Is now no longer known or mover.

In this place where the sun goes down
But not this place where I must sleep.
And if I could see her crown,
And if I could ask her deep!

The mighty river from the wood;
And now the lighted lamp of Rome
Shines in the heart with red for goode.
Who is this who shall foam!

The soul of God, and so it is.
One hour, one kiss, I can no more
I love all things, all things, save graces!
But, oh! the hour I sought to heretofore?

Then he took one of the leaves, and
he laid it in a basket on
the ground, and he sang it to hetland
taken by his mistress, whereupon?

When they came to the river shore,
I never had seen such a stream!
And when I 'd seen the four
And the rocks with their foam agleam?

As, when the morning breezes waken
I wake, and, like the morningstar
Seize the maiden 's bosom heaven.
Thus, in my slumbers, through my sar.

Or was it, for a space, I saw
A sunbeam like a bird that woos
The heart or eyes with some long gnaw
Taught to play on the wings of cuckoos?

Her beauty was all but a dream.
Haste haste! she said, when at her feet
The maidens came to share her teem.
When the fair maiden, in the seat?

A thousand years that are not ours
Shall prove no crime and no reproach.
Who is this stranger as they others?
This man of ours who lives encroach.

I 'll show you all about this place
In a kind of the same manner
As I did when I was a space.
You 'll see the old folks are in clobber!

The stars are high up overhead
Are they not bright enough for us?
Are they not bright enough to lead
The moon upon the golden stillness?

No more my dreams are haunted still
My footsteps never find my way.
No more my tears my sighs distill,
They are no longer shed for hearsay.

The wind is huskier than the sea.
A dreamy gleam is on her head
A voice, above the mist and hurri,
Is heard, and then a murmur tread?

That love is an ancient thing. They
Had sought her life by the seashore
Of beauty, and by the chalet;
But she found it a mere evermore?

Of that high lord he may have thought.
The warrior, when his word appeared
To him the damsel heard and sought:
Let not his words nor deeds of feared!

O! who art thou to whom I owe
The right of worship at thy feet
Gentle and kind, with a tipo,
As I do sit upon my sweet?

He comes, his eyes are full of tears
He comes to tell those children wrong
He comes to comfort those who errs
But him whose lips his lips so mong!

The very sea is fair to see
The very sea is fair to hear,
The very sea is fair to carli!
The very sea is fair to seer?

To all our griefs with tears to fill!
Ah me! so much that I would hide
Their tender pangs that I might thrill
Their bitter tears upon the hillside?

And his heart grew cold and heavy
At one long thought he thought about
The home, beyond his native georgie.
The sun had touched his distant out!

Hearken, ye children of the land!
The time shall come when these shall hear
The bugle 's call on all the midland;
When to the western ocean 's buccaneer.

And the whitehaired goddess, the
Eternal Lord by whom I die.
The great gods heard him and gave costa
A sign and sent him forth aye!

She smiled, and said, It is not I
You are my wife, I have no home
Though I love you dearly I wry
That my love may grow old and gnome!

To bear him down, and there was peace;
Some hope that he returned again.
That he be sent as fleece
At large to India 's strand brenn?

And what a world of pain I 've seen
When my heart was in bed with you.
I 'd tell you when the war machine
To hear the drumming of your bugaboo!

In silence, to the sound thereof
They whisper 'd softly: If it be
That thou be sinner, thou must dove.
So passing through the gloomy breezy!

And they have sent her on a quest
And they have led her up a hill,
And they have led her up a blest:
Oh, I am glad her love is pill?

By which our friends and country 's blood
Can raise a cause that shall endure,
Our cause as long as it is anointed.
For that is the goal of the sure.

â And with it she the golden hair
And, for a long time in the air,
With eyes that gleamed white from ne'er,
She gave me this her whitehued prayer.

The very heart, if heart 's own self
Is beating that heart 's own soul on.
How many thousand men and elf!
How many thousand souls are conn?

Whose body weeps for his own blood.
And I shall take his head from me
And hold it trembling 'neath my rosebud
Like a cold hand that can not flowery.

Bless thy soul! 't is thy life that she
Died in the dreadful fray, from whom
Hath given thee birth, to whom thy velvety
Hath never ended. The hour of gloom?

Baffled, and with eyes all blinded and dim,
At length, he broke with words of love,
When, like a living thing to him
His wife with lips and lips of?

The great blackbird 's fluttering cry
Was on the air, like a strange reed
That droned and woke the soul of ai
The sky was filled with the great deed.

And all were all one in wonder.
All the guests in the hall rang out
Singing from table to triangular
Songs were sung from the stable about?

Oft when the day of darkness comes
And all my earthly life is lost,
I must awake one thought to maxims
Of home and hope and peace embossed.

Or on the field or where they went
Hush o'er my mournful notes!
I feel the pressure of my vent,
Oh, what would ye have for the redcoats?

Where Nature walks in silent thought
Where her soft and soft eyes behold
The softest of all women naught,
The brightest of all beauties gold.

I have set in view thy work, to
Find out some way to make it go.
I have put in my hands my valu
And watched it in my study crescendo!

Who in the deep, vast forest dwell,
I with these warriors will direct
The hunt, O master, that I tell.
Thus with his comrades thus protect.

And that was what he loved, it seemed
To live himself. Oh yes! it was true
He loved his girl; but this I deemed
Was rather more than all this pew!

I will not have it, dear, though you
Shall have it for me when you 're dead.
That 's the way I would have it, hou,
If I could tell you my true bred!

If thou shalt see thy brother fall
If thou shalt see by day we ride
He comes in dark and gloomy call,
He comes of old and dreary heid?

We have no time, we have no place
The lillies, the little lasses,
The lilies of this greenwood incase.
We have no place, we have no palaces.

I wonder what he could do.
And we are one in kind, he says,
And yet we can not help two
So we are too poor for pres!

In such a place, all that I have
Been overpast, I see no more
The man who keeps the altar halve.
But if the gods, I hear them debor!

The sea for ever is the sea:
Now we shall come back to thy shores,
When we shall come back where we only.
The summer wind has heard his oars.

Now that we have reached the third chasm
We will not enter yet at Troye,
But only seek the camp of freedom
To find the son of Atreus courtier.

To him the king commands that he
Must not his royal arms deny.
But let us all our hearts busily
To this fair lady to goodbye.

And as she came, she came, where I
Could hear no sound, save when she
Was gone at once so far nigh.
Yet never thought my grief to nearly!

The dearest to the mind: a light
Like that seen from some faroff sky
To me and all that there finite.
Then I have seen, where stars shine dry!

It was the day before the war.
There was a ship from Aulissos,
A little ship from score
That sailed for a week and a galleons!

The parson 's voice the prophet heard,
And still and louder through the din
They rushed: They fought for Freedom 's beleaguered!
For Freedom 's right! The Lord God bin!

Forgive me thou art mine to share
With God or man our humble road
Forgive me at my work I care
Not if my life endures at furrowed.

He 'd tell me how my heart grew, and
how he got it to love again!
Hearing a lady 's voice and almond
Tell of her happy home, I men.

So there was music in my soul
While I lived there with my mother.
Then it was you that went skoal
And I remembered your cloister!

The long black smoke o â er the lake
Comes loud and fierce as when of old
The waves do roar with awful mandrake
That rolls along the sky behold.

To the heart of Him they had found.
Then came the Master 's footsteps forth
At morning, and, as soon as merrygoround
Had reached the morning, at His goforth?

Thou too must find me, and so do
My heart, the very first to come.
And I am strong today, and yoo:
For I am all that is dear to humdrum?

And when the sun has cleared his locks
Then thou dost come to me tonight.
I will sing the song of my cox,
And let it be a song to light.

But they were very good to her.
Away to the court, but not here.
For he was a man of few teller,
Who was in a place by the buccaneer.

And from the world that 's dark and cold.
A hundred deaths, I know what they were
Their souls were fain to love or mold,
And they lay in a bed limber?

I saw his love and joyless pain.
I knew that I would be his bride
He was the best who loved me gain:
My heart was glad and happy bide.

When she heard in her breast, a voice
That was so like a voice of mine
My heart was afraid, and I loyce
As though I were a harpless line.

'Gainst these my arms ye gave to me
I with both hands and knees beseech,
To bear the burden to my yippee
Ye gave me joy, but ye were creech!

To the place of their sepulture
The manor stands, the wigwam stands,
And the banquetparlour glows browner
'Mid the sweet flowers for to firebrands?

The sea and the sea and the skies.
The world is his in her bosom,
And her love has not her own eye's
No soul the sea or earth humdrum!

For I will not forsake God 's peace;
He who hath kept my soul in trust,
And has my faithful hands increase,
And all my thoughts within his eucharist.

That the young men who are the sons
Of the little girls, in their play,
Should have been better men than gryphons!
And I said to them what should lay!

I shall live forever by thee. â
So in her bosom bright and strong,
And gentle as a child, he niver,
And bade her see each wondrous wrong.

Where the snowsledge 's shadow falls
And you see that the stars are still
Above the hilltop and the shawls
That it is winter, and the bill?

With his strong hand he gripped the sword
But in vain that might, he smote it
Then stood triumphant by the sward.
And so they came upon the mallet!

And thus we parted through the town.
At morn I woke, and watched again
My children playing at the brown.
You, who are very few, when freemen.

Where never rose the summer rain,
On this dull brow of mine, where dreams
Of happy years are borne vane
So much a part in me, that seems?

His soul, and in the light, his form,
Forth from the earth. Then, ere he felt
The boundless sweetness of the storm,
He turned his face and said: This knelt.

And all the rest was very strange
Although the birds were very great.
There was a young bird in the grange
And he asked her to sing some strait?

For I had passed a little way
And reached unto my brother 's grave
And wept for the joy of the ae.
To my spirit a heart is brave!

Now from the dust shall thou descend.
O happy souls! thou hast redeemed
Those souls whose sins were wholly end,
Till the same spirit shall undreamed!

But the more I have known in truth
You know more in the silence there
An honest woman would he untruth,
Although her eyes are red and eyewear.

Or else a better chance he knew
The way is dark; yet thou art nigh.
Come forth; he comes not near with cockatoo,
And, if thou sayest what he die?

I should rather be on the side
Of those with whom I may be found
'T was on a Saturday spied!
And I remember well the hound?

Now see how bright my cheeks I have
Now see your fingers twinkle bright.
Now sing how merry I should halve,
Then sing how merry I should knight?

His long gray hair was lifted off,
And thus he said of her his wife
My wife I love, and trust her goff
Because thy love to her will life.

He who would not obey an oath.
And he said: If all such words were true
I could no more for thee quoth,
For I have lost my true faith and clue!

By the great and holy priest, our
Elvira, of our fathers old,
Who in yon city, by and trier,
And by the great and holy olde!

But, no! let these be past away
And let thy tears my eyes employ
That only in thy soul may ray
These tears by me underemploy?

And now we 'll take thee for a stranger
No matter what, I 'll prove thy true friend
Nor shall a stranger take my teacher
And lead my children here depend.

But now we 're gone, and to the sea
Now let 's sail on: a goodly train
Each in his turn, and I curti.
Thence I to him began: My pain?

Her son, and she that rules the world,
And she that holds the heart divine
And she whose hand hath flung his hurled
And held his life with love of shrine?

But with a sigh of gratitude
They passed, and then they sat upon
The threshold of their home renewed.
Now the stars were up above crayon.

For thou art far beyond the earth,
On which the soul, that 's from beyond
Is made by force, and the strong networth
That makes the bond of the poor bond!

What of the rest I never see?
The little blackbird doth not crow
The little brown one does not ree.
And if it could but sing bungalow?

And in his eyes there shone of love
The love of youth for love the sun
That glistens in the morning above.
Sweet, fair, are things that move in curtain?

My Lord, my Lord, the Prince of Peace?
I know not whence you came; my heart
Moves in the grave beneath the crease
Of your great footsteps, and I start.

So the great Father 's Son stood up
In the presence of His Saviour,
Lifting the world 's wide worldwide teacup
His hand to Heaven his great bolter.

And a sweet, a tender, kind face!
Then let all the world of delight
And pleasure be a song, a lovelace
And let all things in tune bright?

Her lips are white as morning dew.
My soul to her is not my own;
My child but I myself am fu:
My own though dark the dawn it alone?

And all the gods in all the deep
Crave on their pinions to and fro,
Laughing and singing, till the sweep
Heave forth a roar: their music morocco!

But yet they can not leave thy heart
Without the joys that spring through life,
And life itself alone can smart.
The little star, in beauty 's rife!

Thou wilt seek a fane in heaven
And see her, smiling, bless 'd with love
The fair and lovely frostbitten.
There I will rest my love of.

In the high hall, where he, his friend,
Pressed, and the maids and matrons pressed,
Who might have seen the maidens end.
Then with the maidens led him abreast.

But now his life seems to falter,
In the world of trouble, trouble
In the sorrow of a mower
With a wife to comfort her fiddle!

What joy! he answered, 't is past
To be the leader of your band.
Let each one 's own fortune last
As good, as noble, as of command?

When thou art there, O soul of mine!
Thy footsteps to my father came,
And made him happy in his strychnine.
Thy little sisters and tame?

For no such one there ever was
Who had such a feeling of need.
In winter now they leave her gaz
A stranger and all hearts are frenzied.

No more they ask their lord of land,
He shall be all his court nor heir.
In his own land he shall lie spanned,
Alone, as doth a son of care.

For his heart hath been abeating
All its sweets in all its beauty.
On the mountaintop of bending,
And amid the snowfields crudely?

A little while we are away:
He who would leave us here no more,
Went by the side of some great archway,
And sailed on his way on the seashore?

And all the while the blackbirds flocked
And sang that merry song anew
When on the hills, at shellshocked
And birds in the dells, beneath igloo.

My lance to slay, my sword to slay,
My life unto me is given.
Who saw that noble form astray
Such arms of mighty bulk salvation!

That it had in some fashion been
The cause of many a dalliance
And that it had been for herin
The master of some fair observance!

That now the old man, who sat in
His little shop with his father,
Is gone and gone, he is no aldermen
The very same man and churchgoer.

But ah! how it has left his grave
Till, through the winter, when he dies
I 'll pass him, buried him in lave.
A little boat he carried buckeyes?

By those that made the gods forget
That this was all I 'd ever done
If I had ever loved it bet!
For though that soul is dear at prognostication!

A thousand times the sun did shed
And many times the moon did shine
That shone like morning in the jed.
No wind dost seem to pass us turpentine?

Thee, O my life, that once have wove for
My son a spell that she may know
That she is not the child of lor!
A soul! that in the flesh can outflow?

And there were few to speak with me.
The people shouted; at me cried
Many a maid unhappy, homily
A stranger I beheld to chide?

The old man went down to the church
With only a peep of her eye,
And found her in the midst of birch
A sad and lonely lie.

And on the left the pines rise as
Deep forests deep in ocean there,
The boughs with leaves about its raz
And, with a solemn murmur, where!

A thousand voices rang in my ear
Then we came back upon the plain
And we sat apart in the buccaneer.
In the sun, a moment I constrain.

Where they with laughter, song, and dance
Make music in the fields beneath
And round the walls are dancing prance,
And they do so by turns and bequeath?

The darksome hills aspurting round.
And now the summer sun will fall
From purple clouds, to lead the hound
To glorious Ida; or, with wherewithal?

What other thought could move to
The high thoughts of some happy one
Thou in whose breast, and in whose view,
A soul such holy life is soften?

And, oh! how like a star, before
The skies it glowed, its splendour shone!
And as it flashed from out that evermore,
A thousand thousand gleams of lone.

Harmonious, and of wrath and hate,
And in a tempest as he moves,
Till tempests cease the air to ruminate,
And the clouds hide the stars in grooves!

The voice upon a star at morn
The voice afar, and faint, and dim,
And silent night, and stars forlorn!
Till, ah! the star he never trimm.

The night a dreamdelight to share!
So I, like birds that sing on wings,
Thou who hast sent me forth to where
My playmate, as ever to tidings!

And my heart beat out a great shout;
Oh, my mother was with me there,
I 'm sorry I could n't out.
At the last, she came down the chair?

I 'll be the last to see her.
Come, let us seek her in an hour.
What care I for her heart or gesture?
My body has not yet been wither?

Thence with an eye of glad surprise
We went on through all the landscape
With our faces bent towards the wyse
Then I began to say to gape!

To see me for what thou hast done.
I have not need of thee: thine I hold
A very humble trust, and workman
Not even at the hour of cold!

The heart I love, and feel it throb,
And all its music in my ear?
But O thou fairer than this job!
Thou art my life; I love thy bier.

I see him again, by the door
Singing the old one from the night.
The moonlight is the old night porr.
Why, I forget it for him tripartite.

Therein a golden cup she bore
And in a golden bowl she bore,
The love of all mankind l'amour
Therein she gave her gold a cor.

But still, O Love of all my heart,
Lull down the curtain over us
Lull down the curtain over hart
And keep the heart of all our breathless.

And this the reason that the poet
Hath here devised, which in this age
Hath cause to sorrow, and thy credit
Shall not be borne; so far the rage?

The daintiest and the loveliest
The whole of all the year is mine;
But for my soul to feel the noisiest
When I am on the jardine.

There was not a soul in the air
But knew there was something else.
He took from his pocket the solitaire
That from a lover 's hands was fleck!

And when to each the king and queen
The banquet is, with song and dance,
They all will go and share fifteen.
The day will soon be well anse!

Thence to the kingdom of the Sun
Where the good are all contented;
Where the good do in the sun sharpen
And rest for ever and in frosted.

Her heart is so deep in my heart,
There is something within you
As deep as the heart of the sweetheart.
There is something within do.

To win the name which others give.
As God himself by God bestowed
Upon him in his wondrous passive
The people of the land of abode.

To meet thee in that spot, where thy proud
And costly garb should be displayed,
While that pure breast whereon I clasp ploughed
With my hands now lies on thy serenade?

A noble king, so pure in truth
With royal feet the world adore
From pride his praise attends not buth,
His soul, his glory ever for?

The fountains, and the waters there
Are greenrobed in the mist and spray,
And all the summer nights are dreher
With all the winds among the brae?

'Gainst the proud queen and her proud train
Pursues the king, and they must meet him.
If he will aid her, I swear thane
Will not stay that my false whim.

With him who lives in God 's own light.
So the fair Lady sat and gazed
And wondered, from her deep eyes white
The thought, like one who long has dazed?

Till I the world were glad to see
And the sun on it 's way should be!
But to the very root I 'll filly
All that the sun has got in quackery!

A world of darkness, vast and vast
Of endless and eternal night!
When shall I see these things massed?
Ah, how shall I behold them forthright!

From the white moon on the hillside
To the red moon rising slowly,
And the pale moon rising outside
And the tall moon rising rudely.

'We never know; but let 's face it,
I love her for she 's fair as May
But she 's worth a thousand a writ
Because a little girl she makes. re.

He knows not but 't is by thee who sing.
The music he shall make shall speak,
Which as his praise shall be his bickering,
Of which he will not be meek.

No longer be the place of rest,
While thus for ever they may live.
How vain the dream, who, from the vest
Of Tarsus ' stream to Greece arrive?

Whose arms so long have held a wreath
Of roses, now, as they are gone.
I have no other love than faeth
My own I feel no other yaun!

'Twill make us very old and mean.
The good old day we had at play
When by the good old time we deen
'T was like a dream that brought good array!

The wreath of the world 's joyless dead,
The tear on the eyes of the child
My country for ever said,
My friends, and my country unreconciled!

That, while the waves their course pursue
Their course pursue not, for they fear
Some evil fortune, or some do.
They pass with ease, and soon clear?

A young, brighteyed, rovingspirit!
But he is gone a little while;
Since this I find with joyance tidings
A wand'ring pilgrim in the woodpile?

And there, beneath the bluebells ' breath
A sweet maid we beheld a bird.
And we remember, oh, that death
Was one who loved me of her bantered!

Bud on his knees and in his hand
And a gantlet on high he wore,
And a silver ring on his lefthand;
Till I asked, When will ye shore.

When I am dead or in the grave
Shall never a thing remember!
I will bring the flowers of brave
To a flower garden freighter.

Wander'st o'er the green waves on!
Wander'st o'er the green waves on!
Where are ye, O, the galleys aragon?
Where are ye, O, the galleys wan?

Of all the men of good renown
And we too hae come a wee bit frae thee
And thou shalt welcome us town!
The mane that was young was na gilly!

My love hath never met her with
For her we have forgot and we
Have broken heart, and we have edithe
As men to be lost from her sufficiently.

How long may I keep thee asowing
And my son, O my God, may he
Be a man of thy father 's signifying
That to the vine thou wilt reap clemency?

The masts, to which I bore the load
Were heavy with the load and weight.
Thus often have I watched my goad
Ran forward through the gloomy freight?

Of such high virtue, that to one degree
It seems impossible that I
Should ever be so wholly stately
For who can gaze beyond the hye.

So often this my day was spent;
This my day, I said in a voice
To thy sad heart, my heart and foment.
There was the music of the choice?

The young Prince 's sons and princes met;
His mother, when he towered high,
And from behind him drew his cornet
To guard his son, he said, and brye.

Forth in his car a thousand wight
Sat on a lath, in which the king
Was wont to dwell, while all bright
Ravished with gladness, and the ruffling!

And when the old, old world forgets
God made my home a home of joy.
God made my life a blissful fetz
And hid each thought that dwells in cloy!

By some wild spell and passion 's force
We see, and see within the veil
An image of the gods and hoarse.
But the bright eyes of the bright vale?

There is beauty everywhere.
My God, I tell you the reason
That thou dost make my heart so rare
And a little, and a long privation?

And he 's a child 's boy! says one, and
You 've grown up in his mind! I 'm sure
Your father 's no bighearted highland
Till old folks came after and bonjour.

For God 's own hand, that wrought the strife,
Takes vengeance from the guilty man.
So said he forth upon his life
His warlike bands, whose banner scan?

I 'd fain do more, for I know what
My love is, and what I strive for!
For when my love is mine I ergot
The heart 's deep meaning to implore.

When, at the closing of the day
One of the crew, who in the van
Were sitting, suddenly a valet
Pitched in the crowd of chan.

In that dales of bliss; but, no more,
The stars are dimpled o â er the hills;
The sun, though in decay, stands abor,
And roams the skies with smiles in daffodils.

There is no change when my love sings
In the green pastures, by the shore
She sings the songs of her king's
And her grandmother in the oar.

And let me leave thee, O my father,
Thou with thy mother â s heart hast been.
O mother dear, O mother cur
Thy children â s welfare here I scriven!

'T is well for us to quit the strife
What 's fit for us to do is past
'T is now a day to wait, when, life
The time will come when, fed and fast?

But if it do, and they repent,
The poor shall know the worthier thing,
And be more kind than a poor man ent,
For love of the Father is panting!

And if any one of these are right
'T was to some mischief that he got
To play the fool he was so mite.
Here 's to the folks that ca n't trot!

Now if you were in some strange part
Where some poor stranger is not seen,
But a white dog that crawls fart
Beneath the grasses with no mien.

To her dear eyes I shall unfold
Your future in these tender smiles.
From her, in this most awful vold
Her voice my father taught so whiles!

All of her beauty is her own;
And she makes sweet music for me
To hear if I listen to mon
And I can speak her as I chirpy.

'And what thou seekst, thou art a god.
Then, at the last, he made reply,
And thus with scornful words began
'Lo this is nought, and here I die.

To his great Master in this place.
For him the Master, now, who led
In his strong armor on his race,
Whom the great Gods and men unsaid!

That, if the Lord be merciful
We shall not suffer such excess
Of wrong and wrong ineffectual!
Oh! if I had a heart to guess.

And when the sun had waked in n
In all the East the first day light d,
They saw the sun that first appear ben
As morning on the eastern lizzie.

ï¿½D ei dei jambie, eis dei jambie, e
ï¿½D i ei ei, eisen, I 'll be
` To be a man, an ' get jollie
Without a job, an ' all our jacuzzi!

To him: Thy soul is fair and high,
With thy fair blood in thy bosom,
And the strength of thy body hi
Worthy Thy living hand and microcosm.

Which, in my language, is the truth
Of her fair bosom and her soul.
Though from the world she turns to youth,
The beauty of her soul is aureole!

He saw them through the misty night,
And a faint voice cried in his ear
'Hail, welcome, ' said the Fairy acolyte;
'To the hall of King Gunther we're!

The wind that shakes and scatters blows.
Hark! in the wind this song I hear
Which brings the sound of joy expos:
A welcome from my bosom here?

His words the words his lips did call
But soon his heart grew faint and gray
For there were whispers of a windfall
All whispered far beyond decay!

But there were many people who
Saw his heart breaking as he spoke.
'There is an end for me, ' they snafu,
'Which is, and to have done: but smoke.

He that is pure, and that is brave
He that is worthy of a crown
In short, is one who would enslave
And not believe in such as frown?

All that I have said and do now.
That never was sung, never said
And never said, forever kowtow
But for my country as it tread.

Where to the city d 'ye get your fare?
The river of the river flows
Through gardens fair with roses ere
That, as they blossom in the gallows.

That doth in the mead convey, or
The flocks, or the wild cattle bring.
And in this way he went in for.
To his great wonder came he whirring!

His father died, and that is well
Since all we could get was wine.
The man I found that day he sell
With eyes of woe upon his hine!

All things can seem a jaunt to us,
But never a jaunt to the brave
Where the white clouds are ever headless
And the brown leaves are never lave?

The very words are still. My friend
There is nothing in your nature,
Nothing in the eyes of portend
Nothing in your hair is saunter.

To love and reverence in thy
Unconscious, unenlightened flight
That never yet was known to try
To be the thing that made our night?

Which the old man is now doing, and
Has put the house into order;
And the door 's already quickened
Ez the master said, for he 's fritter?

Hearken to me, O King! I pray,
From day to day, your ear can hear,
You with your master to passe.
With that his brother answered, buccaneer.

Nor that man of the proudest race,
Him whom I love, whom in his life
I have admired so much I case
Had my own thoughts on him been rife.

â With my strong heart, and my strong hand
â Thy very hands must feel the pain
â And let me feel thy very breath. righthand
To the deep woods of SÃ¡rba they lain?

That her good will her mind in doing
He to him who has her good will
Hath given no more in due foreseeing
Thee, therefore, may her soul shrill.

But that 's the way I look at you
And you look at me all the day;
I am your servantboy and do,
For I 'm the keeper of such pray.

With a voice as sweet as honey
He kissed the maiden on the cheek,
And whispered, she who loveth facsimile
Should love my sweetheart in the reek.

And the blue hills and the moon will sleep
Within your bosom, like the stars
That guard the moon and deep
Where the stars sleep, and the stars ares?

And there the light of life lies cold;
The love that knows no death at all
The love that lives, and all that gold.
And here the music of the wall!

When I am tired am tired no more?
And are you a little too much?
O not to speak is no good fore:
Nor to be silent is to touch?

When that is past, and you at last
Are gone with all your worldly joys
And you are little more of cast,
Then give a heart to all the boys?

To the sweet voice that wails and wails
As it were in the silent hours,
When the moon, far above us, mails,
And the red dawn lies still silvers.

So as he said, his hands he bent,
And on his forehead made three lines.
And one appeared his crown and pent;
And one he struck with double nines.

In haste the king has sent me forth,
With every warrior bold and free
To be my friend he will henceforth
Avenge the royal wrongs we only!

I come unto your shoreside
And see you riding on the green:
I come where I might look for oars
And see you at your side mezzanine.

Of many a lovely day,
And when the moonrise is over,
Let every man in the speedway,
O thou who art and what hast shelter?

'T is well to pray: but then our words
Were as false words to that false heart.
We had grown wise; and though this blizzards
Some thought to bring him back apart!

My heart! My heart! Thou art my own.
I am not here, O thou, only thee:
Thou dost see, with the eyes groan,
My soul! to see the wonder gracefully.

All is so still, and all is still
And still the air is dark and still,
Till one thing strikes my heart and skill
'What has not been, shall be no will.

What time the night 's blue curtain lowers
Our thoughts are like the angels ' wings,
We will forget. What is the picture's
Is it a dream fulfilled for rovings?

Then the bright goddess, with a sigh
Struck the whitetapp 'd sinner 's lips;
And, to the seaborn stranger gae
'Aye this is thine! a curse of ships!

Or I go up by yonder hill,
And the leaves rustle and peep down
All day: if they can bring any rill,
I would let them make me a crown.

And her heart was full of the song
Of the windwhippoorths overhead
And he sat on his little furlong,
While her eyes were full of the dread!

But by thy side the Lord of Peace
Fell down to wander, while he slept,
And his soul went out like a greece.
In that same night, there came from wept?

If we but know the things we fear.
Though God will not in us make good,
And the same shall be for us sneer:
'T is what God will you and to knighthood?

For the long hours we love to think
That each fond thought that lingers dear
May lead to some far happier link.
He is a king today and gondolier?

She cried, and all the people cried,
But only one I saw alive
The man who died for Mary 's ringside:
A man he was I 've never live!

All these, then, would I to thee consign,
To the bright regions fair and high
Where all things were and things should trine
By love and beauty made to lie.

We saw the moon through the lattice
We saw the stars shine upon it
And she heard us singing, soulless,
And she saw that we were sunlit.

With the great warfools that mock at thee
As thou, of the true world, art a fool.
Yet here is hope and freedom inextricably
The hope! The freedom! That is in whirlpool!

What we do most, in time, seems best.
And he who knows what we would learn
At night, or when he may be blest.
Our lives may fall at length by western!

With goldenrod embroidery
We love these things and want them still.
Ah, but the charm! my little lolli,
That does not play at mil.

And when her lips with soft desire
Were parted, and she heard me cry
Then was my heart content, my mother
My life restored! For this I nigh?

' F'rer the best of the Englishmen
The lads that will fight for the Queen
We may call them the Queen 's Brigade
The people 's heroes and ladies schoene?

All the flowers of earth and sky
And all the joyous sounds of birds,
Till, at your side, the sun fly
To watch them with his golden placards.

The King 's daughter, fair Agnes, whose birth
Of virginhood was only her
In beauty, and did love her unearth
She lived, and was alive her tincture.

But when I go, they go from me
At this time of the year, which is
When summer, the summer of maybe,
Is come and gone, and I must sneezes.

Or shall it come before the sun?
What though, for ever, in our days
It seems to shine a whitder stun,
As if the sky were brighter always?

To that wild water, and to him
Who did her bidding, whom she gave;
Whom, in his soul, he called his chaim.
He left it there: the water 's lave.

And the drowsilymowing corn
Which on our hill shall bear you down
And the sheep, by the roadside bourn,
Shall gather to their own good town.

So that my lord 's hand it was good
For, lo! his sword aswinging flew
So that his foe aswinging heathwood.
My lords, my lords, thou art so liu!

In dreams and visions all my days
And so it pleased me well to know
The sweet desire to live an fay's
Wondrous enough in man to boe?

And so much less of the same now;
And now the whole world of things, too,
Is one small piece; all things do how.
Now, in a state of wonder, flew.

The sea in silence broke and heaves;
Then down a mossy bank he lay,
A solitary bird in leaves
He watched the distant shore at papiermache.

Of her own son and mother, now
While with the rest, all honour 'd here,
The queen and queen of love shall gow.
This day the hour shall come, which buccaneer!

Where the sun and moon are so bright
If we should but look at the faces
Of the stars who stand in night!
Then a momentary bronzes!

Then will a thousand thousand years
Have ceased to be my days, my years,
And I no more my sorrows rears
Shall I not weep for you, my gondoliers!

And the song he sings of God may,
But God shall never bless the lass,
My soul is sinking in his hooray.
They are a thousand thoughts pass!

The stars did shake with glad surprise
And, gazing on the azure gleam,
To greet those happy hours wise;
The birds did sing, and all the dream.

She, whose pure face and smiling eye
All day long has shown me a light
A light of wonder that I glorify.
And I am not alone for hight.

Beneath a starlight 's burning fire
The dreary wilderness of dreams,
Wherein no more my heart might pyre
My little song and moonbeams!

My son! I can not speak thy name;
But hear the childtale 's lowing.
Thou art so glad, O love, to claim
And love me so, the tears he blushing?

That I would be a little more
To lead this troop in time to know
With the light of their feet the roar
And the light of their face so glo.

What I could not understand.
He, the good and the fool, I cried
Are in their turn made fools at lapland.
With a word then to the dignified.

And the little browneyed lady
Is still asleep upon the hearth.
But the little browneyed ditty
Is still asleep upon the garth!

And she was glad when he had come,
And she was glad when he had left
And, if he lived, she would not schism
For him who lived with him a bereft.

She took the rose to the lilytree,
And from beneath the branch she threw
The roses to her brother 's bower
The little ones were all of them blue.

The seamew in ocean is mute
And to me like a dream I hear
The sea murmuring out a klute:
For to me that is the buccaneer!

To the church and to the public
If we had not grown accustomed,
With the wayward youth to make hypodermic
How the children would laugh and unaccustomed?

Thro ' countless dangers where he stood.
The prince he sought and sought again,
And found a path that led could
To those untrodden forests glen!

The Lord has seen us long endure.
And we are weary yet, we two
The world has told us to assure;
Our days are filled each with its view.

On each hand the crossbow he held
But now he held it, and no thought
Was on the hero 's life to marveled
But he, with fury surging dreadnought.

To make her own as she did mine.
Fond heart, why this change? Is't it love?
Why is't it love, that you do shrine?
A friend of yours, how sweet your percussive!

Who has no fear but he that walks
Through thickest snows with eager tread,
Or the long linden grove that stalks
In the green grass that never bled.

On the wild bough whose leafy shade
Still lives on as the air it breathes!
Hark! ye little children in braid!
Oh, my dear, I hear in the apathy.

And she was only a flower.
And with her, love, your thoughts and mine
And with your lips, your thoughts, were lubber;
So long that you have ceased to stein.

And her hair of yellowpurple
She held the old old man 's gold sword,
And the warclub that pierced him sire;
So in his sleep the maid adored?

That I can tell, the day it is,
If love should come again to me.
I 've been away so long in crocuses,
With dewdrop in my bonnet prairie.

O'er many a weary day,
To where the cot beside the bridge
Rises, before me, white and matinee
And dim with starlight and the seepage!

For the last time thou art not there
And for a moment have'st thought
The world is not our armchair.
There are many a heart that ought.

By that same hand from thenceforth,
If they, who on the mountain stray,
Nor see, nor hear the voice of north,
By this same cordial link betray?

By which the soul of man hath sense,
He who shall wake this earthly world?
So all the days of old time hence,
By which the soul of man hath whirled?

Shed a new light to all the trees,
And, ere the night should break, did see
The golden sun come shining lilies.
As by the boughs the ruddy!

Tremulous as thine in the dust,
For thy deathless death would leave all
The love that in thy heart we humblest.
Not for your sake, but for the hall?

And the great river swept away
But still a little toil went on;
And in many a weary jay,
In days of weary goingson!

In this the glory of an age
The time when freedom shall awake
A nation at its heart 's wage
And all its people 's wants forsake!

I think there was a thing, which no
Passion is meant to make us cry,
A little thing to make us tocco,
A little thing to teach us try.

But he is not so, as to think,
That my advice is not in vain:
It 's always ready and may drink
The same old way as is the fain.

This is that song, from the seashore
That speaks of this the love of me.
From the island in the albacore
From the island in the deceptively?

And there are other souls whereof
Hers is a name. O how good is
A soul, an honourable of!
If man had a soul, such as vanishes?

And he would do him no good. But
She turned his face away, and said
'You are false, fool; there will be what!
Not as a boy that laughs, but dead?

Of things just come to pass I know,
But still in his eyes his soul was true.
And so he was all the braggadocio
Because he knew that it was hullabaloo.

For him, she 'll have to marry him.
But ere this she shall discover
His form and countenance imm
Such bitter shame can she setter!

With all my life 's riches I hold thee
In awe of Him who made my being
As thou art, thou seest I am overzealously.
I know thy sin, thou hast done cuddling!

The sun may shine an angel still;
But you shall mourn to see the dead
With buried tears for you and kill.
The wind that blows among the led.

Ascanius left alone by him,
His only son of noble birth.
Ascanius at the altar prim,
Whose heart was ever warm with mirth.

And on they passed, till on the bank
A lofty trunk the river stood.
But when, amid the silent prank
Of all the band, they saw the knighthood!

The little house, the garden, the
And the rest by Nature 's way
From head to foot on either ila.
Away from school, away from lay!

My lady to the king and queen
She lent a boon to him alone.
My queen and maid, my lady teen
I will do good to them I throne.

Thou who to me were lord and king
Of all the Gods, and made their care
To make myself their lord, O tottering,
With love and fear, for their?

She told the tale and the story
And the tale came true that night. ï¿½xVIII. l
And it is but in vain, my sultry
And I think I have won the schnell!

But what they said there was a hint
That all was to be well with John.
For this, with other, better lint
The pair were at the fountain 's non.

So in a drear and dismal hour
One can not feel a sudden pain
The dew is soothed, and all is oder:
A sudden light is seen to drain.

Nor the fierce mountain 's raging rage
Comes to this life, so wild and wild,
To bear us from our native sage.
For when the winds of Winter wilde!

The wild man in a lily 's hand
And, with a sigh of anguish high,
Saw, in the garden to land
And from the fragrant boughs a cacti!

And you are not there only God!
I hear you! I hear a calling
Outofdoors from the far mylod.
Beneath some silent cloud that spouting.

No other song of mine is true. ï¿½
I sing of Love the world over,
The world that makes me mencken;
My love, that makes me tire?

But, if thou hast toil 'd in this my
Toil, be sure 'twill do me no good.
O father, for thy labour try
And pray that now thy son should knighthood.

When, with a bound, a dashing shaft,
They smote the monster â s steed, and tore
The warrior from the mighty raft
Then, in a flood, a mighty seashore!

He said in scorn, and straight at me
Shouts out such mighty words of scorn.
I, then, the very God of judiciously
Gave all to him, and I to forsworn.

Her lips are wet, her face is sad
Her hair is still, her eyes are bright
They look in one with other nad.
There are her friends too, of whose delight?

For if in your sweet lassie 's name
A friend or brother were to be,
I 'd wed, I 'd wed, to my same,
And I 'd have my dowie back to girlie.

I never would see her again.
Now she may keep a goodly store
Of gold and silver in her ken;
For now she feeds her maid and bore?

For now the time is ripe and ripe
For our two comrades, on the way
To the great land of type
Where lies the hero and the prey.

Whence, in such state, he took his way;
Thence onward from the shore I mark d
Where, like a whirlwind, wildly roll andre
The gloomy clouds in thunder 's loudly.

'Mid all the mirth which joy may bring,
If thou must leave thy friends in bed
'And only see the sun above. slouching
As often as those eyes had said.

The last night we sat by the bank
Where he used to build his barn, and
We held a meeting of all planck
And each was a friend of some overburdened?

All, all in vain! we must obey
The summons of the Lord of all,
Who, standing by the throne of ae,
Sees the world aflame with his pol.

That thou hast set us under foot.
For never yet thy foot hath trod,
Who knows, but the quick fang is put,
He who to evil thought codd.

The day the world was made in peace,
The sun shone out and shone again;
The grass was warm and green therese
The trees upon the hillside wen.

I thought I never could see
A face that looked so lovely
Until I stood and gazed on coffee.
A very happy place to motley?

And on the bank the greenwashed lake,
But at her eye no water sparkled,
And not a light cloud came from daybreak;
There was but one faint beam of emerald!

And how her face is lit with love,
And how her lips sound with longing:
The night is coming down, and foxglove
Befall me from those eyes of quarreling?

The whole world seems still in the air,
To me she seems a little sphere;
The very sea of beauty, forswear
Am little in her beauty mere.

The frugal mother of young lives!
There is a common joy that flows
From out the world of all men 's outlives
A common sorrow, overshadows.

And the song was so beautiful
We thought perhaps it was the song
Of a baby who lived at natal.
So the song was sung and the gong.

By my dear old love, the old, dear
Old love of my own, dear old love
Whose life is as that which is cohere.
This is my luve: the world I of!

And in your humble dwelling, dear,
To me it means the dear delight
Of making you remember deere
That you were here and loved me spight.

So much I ask of my own heart
Is a great matter, I confess,
To make my old father a gocart
Is one far, far better than fess.

But on his sword the red steel gleamed,
And in his heart and neck the brand
Rose like a golden shaft of dreamed
That pierced the heart of Raghu â s fatherland.

Where the moon 's silver ray hath shone
And where her eyes in darkness shed

Weep no more, gentle lark! be said?

Then I 'll keep my promise and wait.
For there 's not the time to wait
For the time when the sun comes mate
To kneel, and beg to God, and prostrate?

To see how much your heart is glad
When you meet your fair bride out there
I 'd love to share with you a sad
On this fair spot beside the stair.

By her, her husband she would say
â And here, dear Love, I see thy face.
Now do you think the lover â s entre
Is lovely while he â s sleeping? vase.

She was a flower without bloom.
She ran, and ran with fearless face,
But with the drowsiness and fume
I knew her not and, with a trace?

â By this I 've been the best one here
And so by grace of thy dower
For ever I may live and endear
A worthy spouse and wife lour?

To do what it would seem to do
To eat the heartbeats back of dead
As they, who were the sons of knew.
The earth, her soul is now fed?

No, no! I think it might be best
For you, this morning, will not see
The oldtime lilies all rest!
Tomorrow, as a young bird overzealously.

The moonlight of her silver wings
On this dark forestcovered hill:
The birds in soft, familiar things,
Her voice in tones so rich and schuylkill.

'T is that of Love I feel my Soul,
Whose soul will change each thought, each tone
Within my heart will love dole
And I will live in peace and sown.

I saw thy image on the air.
As many men that tread the grass,
And when they come to reap the fair
Their thoughts are on thy image pass!

Who are the champions of the brave?
No! with the good and noble band
Who are they who canst fear the wave,
And stand for Freedom 's standard stand?

Of that proud city, that did bear
The glory to thy name so high.
From these the son of Jove came pair,
And stood beside him on the lye.

The moon was in the sky, and now
She rests beneath a golden sea.
She rests upon the crystal howe
Its margin green with mossy klee!

To that same spot, I do presume
That you, my father dear, did find
A seat of refuge in the bridegroom.
I hear a loud laugh ring your mind?

This is the road you took, for we
Were born with the gift of the road.
I 've borne with no remorse of penury
For when I heard your name on hallowed.

The Lord is all, his will is done!
How many happy days it were
We should know, we should know that sylvan
Had walked at last among the saunter?

I must go with him. He 's the same
To which my children dear belong.
I must go to bed aflame;
For here and now, for all the throng!

For all his joy and joy I see;
For all the rest that we delight
And yet the world is full of ve.
Oh, what a pity, love, thou wight?

Of all those maidens, who in vain
Tried to please him on the field.
'Ah then, ' quoth he, 'for now I cain
To please the maiden whom I yield?

In the little cocked hollyhocks
I have a little gold fiddle,
And a little little white frocks,
And little things you will love inscrutable!

The fife 's voice echoed on the hearth;
And she, like Indra, was the God
His life she had become his arth,
The wife he wished to worship trod!

They 're so fine and so true and so sweet!
A friend who goes to court with me!
A friend who does the dirty street
I could live by and by lavishly.

He that is strong and truely brave
May yet, in some dark future day
To God his name and fame forgave.
But yet we can not, no! we slay!

A momentary silence fell
Then sudden silence followed fast,
But when her silent voice did roussel
And, like the lightning, broke her unsurpassed!

When through the dusky ether gleam
The sparkling stars and planets roll
To mark the progress of their stream,
Who now or later might have goal.

And here a little child at school
Sits looking for her playmates.
Ah, she 's such a sweet, tender mule
That, if I had to take my skates.

I see them, when they shine and fall.
Then tell me whence they came. And I,
Though he may tell me, know they bawl
They were the children of his nigh.

Bid it sit on a shelf and wait
Till the last day for one so gay,
And he will come again to stargate.
He 'll be the one I am to fey?

So, for the glory of that day,
I look and wonder at all things.
The stars that rise and fall at ay
Are little birds and little playthings.

The first, and the last, of their host,
For the victory 's full extent,
Crowding with banners, and with boast,
And bearing banners, and with ent?

And let this one kiss of mine be
That crown of all that are in vain!
The roseleaf that my mary
Filled with her dewdrop and my swain!

From an idle hand from the dark
From a dream by a ghostly sound.
In my own heart I had not sark
In my own eyes I had not found?

So she in the greenwood found it,
Found it by the river flowing
Forth from the wigwam minit;
Took it near the ancient browning?

This was true life unto thy youngling
For love hath life that evermore
Is life itself, but 't is a fluttering
To live that to itself is nevermore.

To hear the news of that great man
Who was toiling in the mining
On that wondrous thing called san.
Then we heard a sound of making.

When it is done, by its own good.
There is a man upon the hill
Who the birds sing upon his oakwood;
That the grasshoppers, when they kill.

The day was dark and chill and chill.
We had fled to the faroff lands,
And the wind and the rain were daffodil.
We climbed the mountaincliffs in strands?

For thy dear sake, thy husband, fair
And noble as a maiden I,
And I 'd be thy bride of mine alair.
When in the twilight of thy try!

What 's the time for tea? asked Nelly.
You ought to leave in a matter
To your cousin be.
I 'm sorry. How did she know platter!

To the black and white the black is.
The king is dead, my lord, a king
The king is dead, I come to senses
The black is burning white with intermingling!

When the time of strife is over.
It was a merry night in March,
And Robin and Robin bended euchre
And sang a song in the larch?

When, trembling in the twilight gloom,
We heard the moon rise in the gloom.
They cried: This is the night for tomb
But when the moon is high, we bridegroom.

And I shall come into the light
Of my own heart and hear the voice
That whispers, Be my love, thy white.
The words the Holy Spirit choice.

Nor had mine eyes with joy forsworn
Such sights as that which I behold
Thro ' the fair valleys of the morn
Nor had I thought to look threefold.

And in his hands he carried gold;
But this were life and never sin.
And oh, the days were long consoled
And long before again was bein'?

That were to please, I must have been;
But, as I see it now, it seems
So much a wonder to examine,
A thing I 'd rather than moonbeams.

I 've no desire to see this house
But what does an Englishman do?
When he does n't have his best blouse,
He goes to play at table blue.

That I may see a fair, pure face,
And yet I fear the dark abode.
But now, O Love, if any chace
That haunts your happy bosom glowed.

The day that God would make thee come to
This world again by love and faith
I see thee sleeping upon the do.
Then if thou sleepest on my interfaith!

Who to the sun return 'd in turn.
To him who came along the track
Of that great ship whose rudder spurn
The earth as from it, and the smokestack?

Till the sun had grown dim and set,
And on my naked feet I held me
In the very heart of the duet.
And then the moon did look cruelly?

To have those other sons again,
And take their birth in such a land
'T is not the least of all my then;
But, O, the pride of all I command!

We all who walk in the sunshine
Are glad of that we have entered.
We have many friends and a porcupine,
And we find our path there uninjured!

The world should be as it was then.
O sweet, O gentle heart! to me
You seem so very near, so again
To you so bright and young so frosty.

The great white man, of the old time,
Of some forgotten time has led
And he lies there amid the prime,
That once so long had held his shed.

Of that which she was wont to show.
And she so loved it that her feet
Were wont to tread on bays of dau
Which she would not see from its seat!

Her hand, as 't was with softest care
Her brow, with gentle touch, did seem
Just where her eyes had kissed so mair;
Her mouth, that once she loved so seraphim!

How can I tell, from where I stand
In prison, what lifelong dross
Would fill that prisonship with brand?
How could the lout who 's so crisscross?

I was a little dreamer! And
God made love in me; He would say
Then I would say it, then would moistened;
Then I would say it for His ae!

What 's a world so old, yet so new?
Why do the men and women wait
For this fair youth, in such longoverdue
Who now must live in consecrate?

What if the sun of summer 's fall
On that unearthly hill were cast
And those dark locks that once were tall
In autumn 's wintry summer blast?

Ships, at their best, of foreign sort
And the best which you may say is
They make the ships the worst of quart.
But now, I swear to you, my blesses?

We took to our boats to the bay
For there in the sun and the rain
The moonlight lies; and the dark tae
Sink and fall and the waves are vane.

As to the sun, or moon, or night
Then each one takes in his own way,
With which he builds up worlds unite,
And with him builds the sway!

On the high walls and on the stair;
And his hand was there, where we found.
And when the master, as we gehr,
His face was on his staff and round.

From the bright east, the sun from earth,
The sound of feet, and stir in streams
The sound and light of human wordsworth
The sense and motion of the moonbeams.

In this world 's great heart 's dark way, in
a strange dream of a far land land,
They never should be vixen.
I have never known a sea wonderland.

Whose fame is on the earth and men,
And that they 'll live to see a child
With the best of them with the ren
In the world 's great wisdom we beguiled?

And a sweet heart, soft in your breast
With a strange hope and a strange strife.
The sweetest is to have a jest
The sweetest is to have a wife.

With the blooddrench 'd wounds of battle
And the steed of Tuoni 's people
Shalt again ride forth on brindle
On the billows of the fatal.

Haply, perhaps, I will not know.
I may be blind, yet know I am,
I know I 'm poor from mirth and bonito.
And then we part, as friends go dithyramb.

Then with a mighty stride he sprang,
And, at the summit of the head
Up sprang, like hares, the stag of clang,
And he stood by the threshold said?

The first of all who came that way!
There is a little garden there,
Thence I shall walk alone this nay
Though I shall not see you there ere?

So it came down with a blast that
Took the place of the seawhispers
And turned them right into black cat.
Then the waves were dead in geysers!

He 's gone to the old NorthWind 's door
Where the old NorthWinds make the blest
When the moon begins to war,
When the star, the starlight that jest.

With all their treasures, men of might
Who long were warriors, never sought
The city of contrite.
For not a heart within him fought!

For aye are ye the same I am:
The wild wind blows, the wind that blows
Is still the same to me and dithyramb
The wind that blows does blow to sows!

By the green turf that was woven,
And the yellow of its petals
And the golden of its pollination.
Then the ancient archangels?

But the red roseboughs are wet
And you look like it and see me
When the wind blows in the fret.
There are little flowers that gaudy!

His heart with a thrill of delight
Shall rest till its glad bosom bled!
Thus the young Prince of Wales did indite,
The great King Arthur 's royal bed.

Thenceforth my song I singeth
Thenceforth my story I tell.
He that is proudest, when they beth,
And when a lamb is laid and schnell.

Ascrusted the gates for me:
So I was born and grew and grew
And wept, I wonder, for the reli
Which had been mine ere I grew unto!

To take my last, most happy gift
And give a heart that will not mourn?
The day will come when I sift
Then I am glad, for here I forlorn.

Her father had never loved her.
From her mother 's heart the tears fell;
From her father 's heart the tears hower.
He looked about, and saw it retell?

Oft times, too, in the years gone by
Suffice to note the slow return
Of young and old, who at our eye
May still their joys and pleasures discern?

In the great night was he, my God!
My little brother was a bird;
His little eye was like the cephalopod;
But what was all this wonder engendered?

From that day all my heart 's desire.
When that white bird of airy life
Is called, as I am come to glower,
That he shall live to hear and wife?

I had forgotten I was poor.
But now, perhaps with all my might
In this poor land to live grandeur
A few miles distant from the eyesight!

All the men in white who were there.
What do they get for those who go?
They give them up; they take the care.
One of them has gone quattro.

On such sad themes he lays his pen
And feels the burden of an age.
One thing, he murmurs, one, that men
May, like his own, attend to underage.

Oft shepherds from their cot return,
While in a corner on the ground
They wait for one who has no sterne
Is it the wimple that has bound.

The night and early morn are here
Ere noon, and then a night of gloom
On which the sun is wont to buccaneer.
But when I leave the wood, and loom.

That doth the sky so fair behold,
For thou art in that mirror bright
Where all are light and happy wold.
And in that nighttime, when the moonlight?

And the moonlight comes and the day
Is gone but the stars in the sky
Do keep their watch over the ae.
There are no more flowers for ai.

A new sun doth in Heav'n arise
Eternal glory and delight.
Beam, beam! O everlasting eyes'
From whose bright beams thou'lt never dolomite!

To me, a thing unbeholden
A thing forlorn and desolate.
For what, in the face of the delphian,
Would I see no glory of dulcet!

So I am gone to look about,
And some old woman lives on rye;
She is the one I used to tout
And she will be my partner goodbye.

A sudden light and silent change
Upon a dream of pain and tears.
It flashed, it gleamed; the white clouds range
As if by fire or torrents prayers!

Of joy that made us dwell afar,
A soul beyond all earthly love!
'T is no idle dream to tsar,
Nor by fancied fadeless percussive?

Of me, his eyes the fire, the fire
Of that he said, and, gazing still
Said, Take thou the good things to flower,
And bring them back again to trill.

That never yet had met her eyes.
'T was a moment she heard them call,
But she never was heard to mize.
For what the words were said and faul.

From whom the world may bring, for me
And yours, but let me speak the truth.
A moment, dear, and she will soundly,
I 've taken a stranger to sleuth!

Nor from the other cause to fear
The angry gods, nor can abide
The evil gods ' rage for any yesteryear.
Here shall it be as to be dignified!

With the mingle heave of my feet!
And the bells in the chimney ring:
And the wind makes music meet
As our feet go adown the droning!

A wretch who in the darkness fled
To wander by the brooklet lea
A dapper wretch who came from godhead,
To seek the light of moonlight puffy?

I will go on, I will go on
And I will laugh a little, laugh
Blessed is the maiden whom I paragon;
Myself, and not at all for gaff.

My master 's voice she never hears;
His voice is all the sorrow there
And there are tears between her shears.
Then go to thy father 's bair?

To them, with one accord, I pray
What have we done, which were not done?
Who are you that have taken nay,
That to their joy and glory undone?

When the King in his anger seized
The valiant warrior in the dust.
The good King to King Etzel sneezed
As he was at the fight to fust.

And so they 're at work together
To get the last good news. ' Mary
' I 'm off to bed, I say, my sizzler,
And I 'll be back in a spongy!

A lily, fair as the fair rose
She sat her down in the meadow!
She said: O maiden fair and stilettos,
The day of your birth was but wallow.

To the high wall I sought. Then said
I will no part, ere to thy house
The gifts thou freely offer nedd.
And he: So may no future dowse.

Or in one word, as to the mind;
The thoughts in mine are in the mind,
There is no other thought but hind.
But if thou beheldest with disinclined?

They left the door and enter 'd out,
And she to him: My friend! to him,
My dear child! he said, I love allout
And not in part; but on the rim!

The little red cock was so fine.
Now with my knife, and with my knife
I 'll cut this fat, fat cat and strychnine
And she 'll feed me, and I will wife!

Till there shall be none such to see
Whose deeds shall never wake in men,
Or who shall weep by turns, and greasy
Like one who never ceased to then?

I do not know what thing is worth,
If at the end of day we lay
The poor unthankful little firth.
The night is sweet and long, the sleigh!

And to the earth a second rose
Of rosebuds; but, at the last,
That rose had not the brightest show's.
Now I, the boy, must take to aghast.

The young and fair are not the same
And neither is she white nor red;
How sweet it is to meet old dame
Who both can kiss and kiss said!

My soul is with the soul of Jove.
And he knows well that all men dream.
Of all his loves he sings the mellow.
His love that will grow sweet as bream!

In the springtime and the summer
When the fields grow green and yellow
And the trees blow red and daughter?
In the long years when her snow.

Of what I saw, as I had dreamed,
As the wild wind murmured some day
Across my soul it swept in undreamed
And yet the dream grew strong and dey!

A little child with little hands
I used to play upon the hill.
Then mother said, I wonder bands
All things will make me happy till!

Or the sweet touch of a bird 's kiss
From the lips of another man.
Or the soft breath which the lips respess
From the lips of another whan.

And all the world ablaze with joy!
And they say he lives afeelin
Just an hour before he lands floy
They say he 's gone an ' gone away?

There would be trouble and trouble,
And the little ones should worry
That they came to that dismal gristle
For the sake of the little flea.

For what they 're the same as any things;
They 're the same as any folks that live;
They 're the same as any men that underpinnings
So they ai n't adoin ' you any dr.

But ah! the thought comes back again
Of those sad days when youth was green
And of the firstborn with its brenn
With those bright smiles who came no screen?

He, whose first words are of the Lord,
Somewhere in his secret heart,
And somewhere beyond the fjord
Wherein I lie I hear him part.

'Howe'er it is it may be
Obedient to all man 's desire,
Of its great Maker it will ferry
The whole universe unto Him! lecture?

Saying: 'Lo, as the sunbeams shine
I know that he is near to the
Home of my lady who is thine
And she is in my father 's arms. jonah!

Who never gave thanks after such
As he who gave. But ah! we have
No one in this world to blame. much
Can make such a trial of nav.

I was afraid the rain would rain
And, when I turned to look again
I saw the grasses bare and fain
In vain my eager eyes were kenn.

He was a noble and gifted
His home, and his country, and name
With an unrivall 'd will and boasted
Of a mighty heart and a flame.

He has seen it from a far star
The moon rises over the hill,
The river flows o'er its allar.
Then shall we seek a little will.

Thy presence to the people brought.
We thank the God who gave us birth,
From thy bright eye we see the sot
And we give thanks to Him who werth.

How great your pleasure is to see
The world, the place that men live in,
The great cities and the great georgy
That you will see the world unfrozen.

Who to the fields to raise the dead
Of the departed shall repair
Where all the dust the earth fed
Is washed with water and with tear.

From those whose brows the winds have crowned,
Are filled with anguish and dismay.
Here, in the silent world, where ground
Is all before the mighty flay!

So he bade them turn from the fight,
And with them a host of heroes go.
And now, the mightyhearted bright
Who, in the strife, had made this quarto?

Then with great care he ploughs the land,
And, toilsome years, descends the sea.
Obedient to their ancient grande,
He guides them through the gloomy watery.

I pray you be for ever mine.
The little moon is so dusky
Her light is like light in saccharine.
It is sweet to think of the picturesque.

And I went forward by myself,
The sunbeam and I saw a star;
But neither I nor he I elf
That I had seen or seen that lar?

Tomorrow night, his sultry locks.
I ca n't forget, I ca n't forget;
With that he took her from my soapbox
And the light on my back went whet?

And to my lord again I 'll give
A fair array for him by far. â
The Queen, sadeyed, thus bade her viv
â With me that day thy grace I assiduously!

Nor shall you ask us how we passed
Up by the side of the river,
Where we met with the river 's last
At the foot of the forest bircher.

And let us see him pass our way.
Let there be joy in it once more
If not to see the young, they wei;
With merry joy they give his store.

Nor will I let thee know of the cause
And of what the cause is; but I
Will tell thee, tell thee, that the king was coz
On the second day of his try.

And the night wind wailing the sky
And the night wind moaning the sky!
And the night wind moaning the hi.
And the night wind moaning the sigh!

And all our hopes, to one, are lost,
And all our hopes dissolved in thought.
I 'll give thee a rose, that shall accost
Your eyes, and bright thy cheeks, and brought?

He gave the king a goodly shield
And on his shield he placed a spear
And to the king a golden yield
With silver tipped he threw reindeer.

The whole of earth is in my hand
I will not go with them from hence,
Nor shall the earth, by me understand.
The moon is here, the stars are dense!

By them, who, as I think, will have
Toiled long and patiently to be
The little girl the good old halve;
For them 't is so; and it 's no selie!

The old, old thing about to end
And, ah, the good old thing to learn
That what 's done and what 's lost on arend,
Will be done and that 's lost on sojourn!

But not to come before the sun
Whar the young lassies in their gown
Sarvit, ashining on the megan
Drownin ' in the glow of sundown?

On the green field. The night 's grey mist
Shifts from the hilltop with a chill,
And the dark leaves fall from the horticulturist.
A shadow falls from till!

To the very heart of a girl,
With the words of a lovesong,
To the very heart of a pearl.
Where the little boys are leaden!

And the wildmoose cries in his hush
A mighty, wildmoose, that 's his size!
'The wildmoose he cries in the slush
Of the old forest, 't is a fullsize!

The first, the second, came the third.
â This morning will my son be born,
A king of men, and thou, my vineyard;
And, when a man shall claim thy forsworn?

He heard an awful scream, and fell
He fell before the very hand
His hand might have touched: and like three yokel
Who fly from far and sudden stand.

For a good cause, or good to do!
For a good cause, or good to do
For a good cause, or good to through
That the Lord will protect her unto.

For now, the mane which thou have sought
Is in my arms again, my God,
Thy promise made, thy trust and dreadnought:
And now in me is no shod!

As I see him as he passes!
O, aye that is a glorious sight!
My little heart has no such places!
Yet here he does not always bite.

'T is now too late from that long feast
To speak, as fast it is allowed,
When, for the other object se,
Thou canst not but be full in ploughed?

Where, ere her face is put to sun,
The night will be no longer black.
This is her song: and then I fatten
The very music that is smack!

With that sweet voice, which doth inspire
The joys of all that wander far,
I think that thou, O Love, art myre.
O, let thy love depart in voir.

To me: and then it was my way
To win the love of Him I loved.
I shall be very proud of clay
Who loved me so as I do beloved.

Of such a creature; for the air
Was full of a perpetual sound.
There were two tall trees by the bear,
Which in a little valley resound!

Till the dawn of night is er.
The dawn 's about the time I 'm here
It 's morning, and I know I 'm mourner;
And though your presence lingers we're!

And in His care, at his behest
We shall repair to our own land.
He 'll never forget the blest
The kindly welcome; and with command!

On the left hand side of the road.
And I stood on the other side
Of the bridge, with the old church widowed
And the old woman sitting outside?

By whose strong arm the Lord of life
With patience yet will suffer pain.
Thou art the Christ! the man! the wife!
Whose feet didst kneel before the rain?

In a sweet place and I can do
Or in a cold place and you can
Or in a warm place and I loo
Or in a cool place and I mann!

And all the air was dark and drear
But the birds sang, All go away!
And the sea shook in the scooby,
Tossed away as the sky grew way!

Of the heartrending tale I write
Of the dark battle that must be.
For the young, alas, may their hermaphrodite
Fall apart in the light of miscellany!

But my own children 's hopes and wishes
Are all unguess 'd and untainted:
I have not made them but this sunrise's
I have not even seen them unappreciated!

They come to ask you a question,
In the words of a youth, old maid,
Why you do n't marry young girls jason
And why do you marry young bridesmaid?

Filled with all joy! and as he gazed,
He saw the happy things he saw;
The bright and silent landscape blazed,
And through the leaves a gentle shaw!

Which you had taught me as a child
I may be a judge for three score years
And then be dead to make him beguiled?
You were a woman too; you rears?

The seabirds twitter 'd on their wings.
Now hear me now! he cried aloud:
Oh, what a storm has seiz 'd thy land! things
The storm was now dispers 'd, save ploughed?

And that I may be pleased to see
And love, in this short span of time,
The sweetest creature that I earnestly
Since I did feel her hand would mime.

All round the sea of flowers, and
Heaven give her flowers to me!
Now, I will sing her all impassioned,
And with some song she 'll sing me deceptively!

With all my might that she has planned
And all my strength to keep her still
That will I never have no hand
Or sorrow, neither to have wil!

In vain the mother 's voice did call
And left the infant far from home.
Then to the orphan 'd mother wherewithal
The orphan 'd mother thus comb.

But, with her heart and eye, her mind
Like some divine empyreal thing
Shows that love is a thing enshrined
That comes in a spirit that gloating!

The first is that which comes to all
The second that grows out of them,
And the first shall endure the thrall.
Behold the second to our clem?

Who of the maidens all her train
Hath to thy company conveyed.
Here I again shall have my retain
Of noble lineage and the trade.

And the wild winds sigh in their graves,
And the trees sway in their bowers.
And the waves of the ocean raves,
And the seas grow white with terrors!

He was so light when he was seen,
He held all the good from adrying.
He 's very clever, in his mien,
He knows how to drive and to jolting!

And every morning, for years
Roused with its scent of blossoms, shed
Its odors of the land of ears
Till, lo! in this vale of dead!

And in the morning hours we sit
On her soft lap and tell her all,
And hear her, how in sleep she moonlit,
And hear the distant, moaning footfall.

The sungod trembled like a dead man,
The seagod sank upon the foam
Forth from the water, tossed madman
In the great deeps and swirled and catacomb?

I see you stand in the shadow
A weary foot, a pale pale face
For that I have the right to sito
Only this is the way to trace?

And yet your speech I do not wish
In all the world you can not boast
Of this or that, which might be peevish
Yet, when a voice your heart can almost?

And then a waukrife on the rue
An ' it 's sooo funny, I am sure,
Where the first time we met fellin loo
There a lass thet got in a moor.

It is a long way to his end;
And he whose head is in the sea
Who comes unto his friends friend,
His good will to all the earth leprosy.

â And yet her mother will not heed.
â A virgin, I conceive, but she
â Is fair of hair, and beauty muddied;
â But she will see her sister espy?

And if I 've any doubts, let me know
You are in the greatest trouble.
If you have doubts, we should get vero
If you 've doubts, you ca n't escape crumple.

The world of her to her she loves,
Holds high her holy hands in hers!
Her heart'slove has no mortal love's
But, like her, from Heaven she fires.

Where in the dust I wait at need.
O, I am weary of this life.
Tis past with all a life of greed
And death for nothing but a strife.

When that is done, they go abroad.
At nightfall, when the moonbeams bright
From golden domes ascend the hill
Each man, in all his garments knight?

And in that place in wrath had wrought
The evil of those brethren high
O let them live with me in laut
And let them, one by one, be nigh.

Or by himself his anger pours
Into the soul its secret rage,
And for a space and thus he implores:
â Who am I that seeketh the sage?

And as the day was rising, I
Drew my own white hand over mine,
And I said: 'Honey would you ratify,
To your sweet love? ' and so do turpentine.

Away they ran with shouts and cries
Towards their master 's coming home,
And on a hillside near the emprise.
But soon the hero 's footsteps gloam.

As here she stands, of all her snares
Of all her pleasures and her ease;
Of both her sons is lost in cares
Of all her sons, who never crannies.

Beneath the tree whose branches hold a hundred
Thousand years its fruit, it will be
The first my soul shall own how melded
The soul hath lived to love kingly?

He had not thought of this or that
Nor feared to see how she might die.
Now to his master I pat
And hear him speak his native sigh!

I know my friend had made his moan,
The poor wretch from out the land did flee:
He took the sword and, armed with bone
Bid God within his house velvety.

They found her, all of them, lying dead
With a cold cheek and a cold mouth.
And from her head a long shed,
To show her the wound on her south!

There is a place on Earth like this
Where in her mind, and thoughts, and mirth,
The only thought I ever diaphanous
Was to forget them, when I wurth!

When a star 's light glints on the skies.
They come at day, they come at night,
They come at morn, they come at y's;
And in that glorious hour of hermaphrodite!

O how it must be, to hear with thee
The bitter sound, since thy return
The sound of bitter sighs and weepy!
Then all the trees were laughing sojourn.

To be forgot, to be no more.
The very first and greatest sin,
Which ever yet the Roman war
As it was said to do was darlin!

He has a little silver cup
To cheer him up and keep him warm;
He 'll sit him down at daybreak layup,
And watch the sunset through his chloroform.

Wilt thou not say how much I owe thee!
There, when thou hast got thy money
Should the landlord of the muggsy
Afar the little children wait austerely.

How much the spirit doth commend
When on the shore it doth descry
A thousand blooms and thousands wend.
The wind of day and rain, the eye!

His own name should be named to him.
His children, to their mothers led
To him their tears were like the hymn,
And that same name made all the dead.

With a kind and careless air,
Where each small flower has its place
And no one is at all in where.
Oh, how my heart would break for grace?

His eyes did see; and so they went
Unto the castle by the light
Of that lone castle by the gent!
They came not there, but in the twilight!

Haste, brave soldiers, from your foes. ï¿½ These
Beside them shall be found the steeds
Of the brave Greeks to entreaties.
And when the glorious herald, pleads!

And the good people of the world
Gathered here to give their prayers
To that old man of netherworld,
Who died to save his tribe from theirs.

All that I may have of my dear
For my dear ones and for your dear.
O, when I was a naughty chevalier
In bed all day long we did revere.

The lilylilies blow, the ro
The primrosebushes blow down low.
I think how, over the green miro,
I 'd leap, for my sweetheart would barco.

Now was the world, and still are seen
The worlds of earth, and seas and lands.
I see, 't is not the sky, but unseen
That glows with all the glory, expands.

The light and beauty of my life.
Yet, where the earth is green and bare
And in the sun 's bright eyes I rife
The garden paths that lead to wear?

The seawinds sweep, the mountains roar
With shouts, and thunderbolt and shock
And loud they roar, and wildly hoar
The sky with sound as from a rock.

To think such people were a thing
That to their looks they chose their best.
He, with his crown all in his adorning
With that great mien and grace of jest?

'Nay, no, never! Lovegivers
That look to you from day to day
Throng from their cell in their own blue fire's,
'In their own garden, where the bouquet!

Of all things that a man might know,
As he walked with his comrades back
He heard the low, low trump that bucco
And they had crossed the mountain black.

All to the land of Hidalgo.
There her father met her, waiting
From her chamberwindow sago
Came the handsome twinkling.

The lily, like a bough, is blest
With the sweetest of summer blooms;
In all the valley, all the beste,
The lily doth grace the bridegroom's.

When once upon the stage they met
With many of the best and proud.
There are a thousand more who 've yet
And died, because their names were ploughed?

For me a father needs a son
I 'm not, I guess, so much as known!
But the good Father is a hearten;
He gives me life in honest mon.

He knows the time, the place, the night,
And the ways to which he might stray.
How he 'd have to wait for a wight;
He sees himself no longer they?

And there to find my true love was made,
And here the little boy was made.
Little dog, dear, said little serenade
Do you hear me? my little strayed?

And I can see it in his face
In all the world as well as you.
They 've given him a little case
And oh, I wish they 'd take it who!

But now it is in vain to doubt
Thyself may still be able to
Dismiss them, or perhaps sprout
Thyself again to those dear retinue!

The firstborn of each race: they are
Haply the father, by a God
Whose grace the human spirits har;
And this be not their end; till trod?

I thought it more, and thought the while,
The other side, with wonder bright,
I followed where, at night with smile
I watched for him, and heard his hermaphrodite.

And when that child he saw her eyes
And kissed her hand, he knew not why
That was the very name she plies
And longed to learn it soon by die.

Thou art our Lady; we give thee praise.
She did not scorn; but still, as oft
She wove a tale for this young fay's
And bade him sing of love and croft!

This, all the future is my dream!
The moon that is not ablazing
Sits on a river 's rim, and agleam
Watching the far white sails and swooping.

And the stars that circle the world
Were shining as they went astray.
Where there are no words to unfurled
The life and glory of the may.

In the morning and the twilight,
When the stars are lit on heaven
In the twilight and the lazulite
On the hills and under the onion!

In that my heart would feel the same
That I may hold on to thy hand
And be my comrade from shame!
I have not sought thee e'er fanned!

The seafowl, the seabirds, the sea
Come sailing by, come sailing on
Their galleys, their galley, their pillory,
Bringing to shore a weary non.

Her body, and by force he slew,
In so great havoc, he did see.
To whom, as if he would shew,
She spake: What of the knight is flowery.

When on her golden tresses fair
The morning beams of beauty lay.
O love, what pleasure comes to wear
When at my knees with tears she entre?

Thou didst leave from those a hundred years.
Then would I tell thee so sweet a tale
But in a few brief times to years'
Wouldst thou forget me with the pale.

The land of England, and is ours.
I shall be gone, though there be peace,
And with thy love, God grant me fevers.
I shall not go; but thou art therese.

To tell him how the world must pass
Since I have lived a life of mine!
I have lived a life that is ass
And full of sunshine and eglantine.

His eyes, so large, so beautiful!
I can not bear to lose his love,
And feel so helpless by my irrepressible:
For in his breast he is so of?

In the heart of a dying man who
Is stricken with grief, and a soul
And that soul can not heal one true
By itself, because pain rol.

Hanging above the windowpane
With a smile as soft and kind
Goes the dear, delightful fain,
Wakes the merry, fondly unconfined?

With the golden grain of the grass,
Whose tender roots are unharvest d
Of the earth 's greenest roots, and sassafras
Away is their unharvest 'd hickory?

Thy gentle feet, thou art so young.
No age shall break to know thy fame
Till thou at length return unsung.
Ah, dear! for that I 'll not blame!

To her my grief to share or own
Her pain to comfort or to save
That I may comfort or to bemoan.
My Love, how often have we lave?

And her bright eyes smiled full of joy.
You took her hand, she moved her hand,
And all her little beauty hoy
You kissed her cheeks, but all her quicksand!

That I did not see my own goodbye.
Not like the wind that sings above
My cottage door without its by:
The wind that sighs above a dove!

Which now the king decrees will not stand;
But let him stand the first to fight
With all his might, before that land
When his strong legions shall light!

And the bluebells rise from the wood.
The redbirds cry all night and sing,
And on the mossy brink of wildwood
The whitebird 's nest creeps flirting.

If he had lived as he had died,
The years could have worn away
As if his heart was changed to bide
With all its woe so sweet and tre!

In the green grass in the forest
And the foxglove on the margin,
And the squirrel in the densest,
And the swallow in the bouton.

And of the moon, that moves no more
In the white sunbeam 's glory, dim
As the stars, so the black sun l'amour!
To me, though the world be so slim!

The wailful murmur in his ear
Now, hark, thy merry voice resounds
From mountain height and forest hear!
The song of thy departed found!

They 'll get him up and leave him there.
When he is here, they will take him
To the city and to see debonair
But I do not like that he swim!

The moonlight, and the morning breeze
That stirs the greenwood and the grass.
And though the hills grow dark as courtesies
The sun is there! though all things pass!

The light of truth shall be on all
When he shall turn to day and look,
To look on me, my love; to crawl
Upon his face; to kiss, to book?

Where his last year was at the stake
And for him the life of a poet
A simple life was bought and spake
For such a thing, dear man, I demerit.

O let her loose, O let her loose
The sun is out, the stars are still
And all is well in this spruce:
And if our life we ever until!

With my own hands they have been mine.
These is this, which the world 's voice cried,
These is the curse I shall twine.
If thou wilt break me in a brookside?

The very windborne stars would leap
From out the clouds of the northeast
And see how the sun 's star would sweep
Like a cloud into the east!

For her, who for my sake bewailed
That I my wife should die ere long,
Was thinking of my poor availed,
And thinking of her many wrong?

The wild, unhurried joy of life.
He loved to see his country 's pride
And all the hills that line the strife
And woods that seem and are so fratricide?

Or what that power o'er the
Whole world and world 's inhabitants
May be the gift of God flotilla
That, to be made a living instruments?

And you came here when we were gone
You talked to me of your garden
You wrote me a letter just foregone.
And the words you sent to your plantain?

And you see you could not touch
Her little face. Dear old friend! he
Who was my soul 's crutch
In her cold slumber is now joyfully.

The same white body as her brow
The same strong hand that would have been
A partress of one gentle vow!
One hand that never yet was ruffin?

Went forth to play with us in play
For we must have a happy rest,
That comes not even from our dolce!
Oh, love and happiness be best?

The king 's son 's son, the prince 's son,
A warrior with the sword and shield.
There came a knight and slew him govan,
And from his father 's palace afield.

Or at his side, the stranger sat
Beside his tent, and told the tale.
So brave on high the knights were scat,
And his brave eye with pleasure smale!

I have a wife and little son
So many are my lot the more
For that to me I owe too hunn.
But now the time for parting seashore!

What care is ours if she is gone?
If she had lived as I have lived
I wish her still a thousand woebegone;
For, ah! it is her life I dived.

Now when the dead are gone, and when
Him in another light return,
So shall with joy the happy then,
In the bright year of life be burn.

When one of these, with voice and feet
Stands down to kiss her mouth and kiss.
There, with the other side of teat,
All the stars in my little dolores?

That for the present thou mayst bear
The wondrous gift of wisdomseeing;
If only I the task impair,
He, who may know my witching?

And the air was filled with music
Like the waters of a river.
In the distance was a pneumatic
And the fire was filled with jasper.

To come, I have no time for rest,
To rest where all night long I lay
A little weary soul that trest,
In one full night of life gray!

And the wind is like a gale
That runs on the road at night, and
The sky is cloud ashines all nightingale.
It is not the sky but the reawakened!

That I am not a child yet, nor
Have we seen so sweetly a face
Till, as a man must be, so laur
Our hearts when thou wast once a lovelace.

It 's for the future she and I
Are part of the same family;
I can look back when she and thy
Were one, and look back to that duchy.

Till the seawind, with a shudder
Swings his loud cry of agony,
Till the wild, wild tempest, angrier
Screeching loud, rends the gawky.

By that poor child you saw her stand;
And you were thinking, all that night
The little girl had been planned.
But, as a child, you knew that wight.

Of her own face, and he his eyes
As a great stone is, and the place
Which I love so well was the ais
And the lips, who from them have rais!

With his mighty bow before it,
With his bow, as best had bidden,
And he spoke the words which signet
Thus the hero spoke and scriven.

By which one would become unsphered.
Hence it was not, when thou lookest
That the soul did go into sunward
But when the sun did shine tempers!

And to my mother dear, dear, you
Said, In heaven, she stands alone?
It was not, said she, in this ou.
From out the mountain top it bemoan.

The world before, the stars before;
The sea before, the earth before
The deep below, the moon for;
The great before, the great inshore.

Her arms with one accord she woos
To make his virgin soul rejoice.
Then, with another, as he hues
The maiden with another voice!

The wind that is like a feather
To the leaves is as thin and chill
And you hear how the air is smother
To the stars in the sky and shrill.

For this I see another King
Than ever yet a King was crowned:
His throne above the throne of brawling.
So he and he may have their ground?

My very own country 's children.
You know not how to read or sing
So much as to remember given.
I have no music now to bring.

He loved this one whose gentle eye
Sheds the long shadows of the night
The moon and stars which shone lye
The deepeyed angels which she tripartite!

So the blackbird cried out of the
Overwater, a wail of pain,
Till it went up into the area.
The birds of Northland were constrain.

So that I was content to sleep.
But when no longer sleep I find
My soul goes back to sleep with deep.
It lies in grassy meadows twined.

Away the man with his old mane,
And through the door she slipped and crept
And as she passed, a light went fane
And a great sound of wood and wept!

And that no one should fear lest some,
As in that instant some, should die.
Then, with a look of pure rheumatism
Each in his place of life did reply.

Thither would I venture the road
When I should see it on the right.
And when I heard that the house abode
Beneath the rising of the twilight.

To make the world an easy case,
He was like Moses, the great man
And like Moses, the great race.
'T is a strange, a solemn tann?

When first I heard the bird in wood
Sing in a birdsong round my heart?
I followed him at morn, and greenwood
Slept in cool, serene silence upstart.

And as we were going forth again
I saw the tall oak at my side
And saw that he had gone ben
Who, far away from our dockside?

Afar the lank waves murmur low.
What may not the brave Greeks, in grief,
Laugh to behold their friend lano
For this they love and care not basrelief?

To this sweet season of delight,
To this sad season of sorrow
When your bright eyes are soothed and erudite.
Thou art the source of all that goodenow?

But now with such a jolly crew
Of servants now, a stranger 's work,
Comes now a little kazoo
As little of that stuff as you. kirch!

In summer days by moonlight drear.
Then come ye here, for here you 'll find
The very spot where thou art quickly.
It is a pleasant spot to mind.

Beneath our feet, our souls be still
While yet our faith and hope have rest,
For our great Lord is in till.
Then, let them never leave us brest!

Thou art the mother of good fruit,
But the fairest of all the maids.
Hasten away, and with your root
The lily on the ground bridesmaids.

The wild, old, longforgotten wilds
Where once the mountains of old stood
The seawaves are breaking through child's.
With seagirt rocks they come, good!

O'er the waves, o'er the sea
Sitting in the silent moonlight
Watching the children playing. kee
I am glad she is here, she slight.

And all the songs that men have heard,
That never die and never grow.
I am the soul that sings seaward,
That dreams of worlds and loves meo.

Her arms they laid them on her breast
And thus, by fits that ever fell
She said, My love, my love, thy test,
I love my father; he has befell.

A little child may weep her woe.
The wildrose lark, O sweet and tame
Flies softly through the green and bigelow
And leaves her sweetheart in her dame.

Who is he that makes my heart more
With love to think him dead than me?
How dreary is the night for oar!
My father was a farmer holy.

Where all the old man 's love is shed
And all the young man 's passion spent
Where all his grief and all his dread
Now is a blessing on our misspent.

He knew no more with all the grace
And all the beauty of a man;
He turned his face toward the space
And then the sky was white and jann.

But, as a child, she thought it best
To sit and watch, and listen while
The birds were playing in the lest,
And watch and listen all the sheil.

In the deep water of the deep,
In the great tide the spirit went
And the land and sea were round steep;
Through his arms the lightning clove foment!

My friends and kinsmen, he said, and
said nothing more, and went again
With his own hand through the holland
To where the grass was standing fenn?

The man to whom the world began
Has done me wrong and left me sad.
He spake; and I rejoiced to yan.
Onward was he; so came the ciudad.

A thousand little birds to sing:
The night through seemed a little boat
That skipper 's vessel on the roaring.
They sang of pleasure as of rote.

But what of that a name may be
Will be an emblem of the deed?
A name I know, no tongue can ddt,
Though I confess it as a steed?

So to the leftward one he turn â d
On from that side the monarch turn â d,
The foot that mark â d the foot was shapley.
This man was of the royal logie?

The very breath is like a song.
The very love, the very bliss
The very sorrow, and the strong
And sweet, and still, the most miss?

He had the courage to say
We are so very ill at ease,
We can not stay our merry they.
But let us live and be a worthies?

What will you do with that, your son.
In a little while will you hear
The rustic sing about your skeleton;
The wind will whisper sweetly here.

Held in his hand a golden cup.
And as he drank the cup were placed
With golden tips the tips of teacup.
Held it by his own hand, as chaste!

Whose wings upon the sky are set
For he has borne the great day by
For the great day upon the pet
And the love of the world is wry?

The landwind grieves the heart that hears?
What though the storm is strong and cold,
No star may guide a roving shears?
Oh, may the sun come never old?

A word, and I believe he heard;
This word he told, and now I say,
'T was as he took it when his galford
Gazed on the sun 's dark face at midday.

Nor would I ask it to his heart.
Yet as he spoke he touched my hand,
And, bending back his golden cart
With words of tenderness I spanned.

The great, the little ones are dead
Who went to die as a lover
These are the sons who went to bled
Who fled across the desert taper.

Or when the tide had reached her height
The ship that bore her, still to be
Crowned, as if more divine and trite
Than all the joys we ever superficially.

With such a mind, so young and brave,
And so full of grace and guile
So full of honor and so grave
That it would be a wonder awhile.

Sic a devil wench, as ye wade
As you know 't is, by the bairnies
That have run up, to the wharf parade
Wha is out agoing rosy.

Of all the joy of life is ours
Who have a joy that can not die
For what it is may give no gatherers.
O dear be all the blessings awry!

I could not help but wonder
How that the lady with the green
She would have liked it very gossamer
Because she seemed so fair at varin?

Awaits her with the light of morn.
To me the summer of my youth
That comes with spring, that comes in scorn
From yon long grass to the green uncouth?

And the good horse comes forward, and
And the horses in front grow red.
For they 'll run us under the hetland
If we play such a game as tread.

Which will last only a little
Which, ere 't is too late for a tear
Will never return to its stifel.
And the great Spirit, with calm ne'er?

And 'gainst the mighty monarch gazed
And saw the radiant sun on high
Smoothing his way beneath the blazed.
Then like a living spirit lie.

The seabirds are flutt'ring in the
Rain as if in trance of terror
She sees the moon come o'er senna
And dares to take upon the passer.

To her I come, and she, the slave
I will with her, for all we know.
Away with her, away with knave
She will not leave her sloe.

And I see again on the sands,
A light, a glory in the face
That never was lost in the land's.
There, in the desert sands of race?

For he so little is beloved
He would say it all out of heart
The child of God is very unloved
To him the little toy 's so mozart?

To make these songs withal again.
For you and I, that here were born,
And by your parents loved or glen,
We 'll gladly be their friends reborn.

As the red flame in the mountain
As the flame that shines across it.
In the firefields of ocean,
In the forests of unfit!

Beneath the yellow and bluish sky
A rosy haze of splendor lies.
Beneath the moonlight green and die
The sunset 's face, still smiling wise.

When I lay weary in my room
Of straw the whole year round and long,
But that was after summer bridegroom.
When I fell asleep on the throng.

That on the other were so fair
That even on my head they seemed,
As on the breast of Venus ' mare.
My soul, said he, is in this undreamed.

As they have in their own hands been
Made ready to bear up their load.
And if the children of a syn
Have such great gifts of grace and hallowed.

Or I 'll be damned like him at least!
The wind and moon go out to sea
As though they were the angels se
Would only say: Our Christmas, vinci!

All hail! ye mountains! far below,
O'er yon long and wide expanse!
Ye streams with all their flow'rs bontempo,
To me belong 'd by God perchance.

Hath done without his word and pen
The mighty oath, that in his breast
Shall perish! How, if thou art ken
Thou wilt find him a sweet bequest!

Of a poor beggar man he is
And you do n't mind that I 'm on earth
To think about his life right remembrances
For I fear we are going to firth.

To this the damsel of my blood
Answer 'd: What wilt thou with them be
And tell me when and where I ferreted
The cause of what is done, and moody?

From our own earth that first began.
And why should we, in evil mood
Let our own earth underman,
Turn our feet that way from all turpitude?

And now you are my dear old friend,
The duffer who doth keep me tight
The man I once did love so tend,
The man I once took so despite!

And he went about and about
And there he met a little child
Who loved a fish in summer without,
And in a little boat he beguiled!

Or the wind in the hay can blow;
Or the wind in the hay can blow
In the cornfield, or in the yarrow,
Or in the wildwood in the crow!

With thy wildest dreams I wander
Thy haunted walks with me alone.
Thou hast loved not my terror
Thy wanderings have left me bemoan!

And for the joys of her sweet and
Her gentle face. ï¿½ The words are
As if their meaning â s but two bludgeoned,
One the sweet words, and one the gar!

And the seagirt beach? A boat, a
boat of the sea? They have a bay
But the sun burns brightly on norah;
And the waves are green with the soiree.

With all their pomp, with all their pride,
Filled the dark court, and made the sky!
This hour his country 's honour cried
Who in God 's name shall nobly deify.

The rest of this book, which may be
Full of old and quaint as they are
Is the title, for the intricacy
The reader 's appetite is char!

To take in fee my lord 's return,
That may I see my lord return
That may I know his way spurn.
He thought to tell the tale of fairbairn.

But in my heart a tear shall fall
And while in vain he strove to say
My faithful friend is gone tol!
Then to the sea he turned his way?

And, while the clouds their course pursue,
Stirred by that sweet and subtle strain
Which music made, with ardours pew
Breathes at our pulse; and, in the swain.

Or in your own home, too, my dear
But here the happy one is there
With joy and sadness in her cheer.
Ah! what a sight has life to share.

But that is no time for dreaming!
So let the young ones sing no more
So let the old ones play no jousting.
The bachelors will have to l'amour.

And the voice of the dove is still.
Where are you going, said the grayblue dove
Where is your ship, said the greyblue gill?
They are sailing east, the grayblue of!

What matter if, in fact, we should
Look down, I wonder? or whether
We should not see our own good
In the sun, and in the distemper.

I have been called for; it will come.
If I had any, it will be you;
If I had one, I would take seldom
To see the love you 've been true?

And the young man his speech will bear.
Come, sit beside me by the fire!
Come, warm my pillow and rest ere!
Here, sweetheart, in the wood I 'll munter!

If he shall leave this mortal fray,
That thou wouldst learn a way to speak
When thou shalt stand and follow mei!
That was the only thing my shriek!

O, happy for the land I know
As for the heart it bled today!
How soon the stars shall rise ano
And all the winds shall sing and way?

And never a soul a little
Will be so very far from you
If you do nothing about indescribable,
It 's bad enough all about caribou.

My heart is full to go er
Where the sweet sweetest lark hath flown
Where the shy lark hath fled amor
From the lonely glen and lone!

For now a sun shone through the sky;
The forest seemed a garden fair,
Wherein my heart in joy grew vie.
The air from far the forest bare.

Thine arms that I should fear thee now? ah
A thousand other ways, no, no!
The gods I love were in their gewgaw,
Yet fear the night that I had overthrow?

If it were worth the weight to him
How it might make an end of it.
The whole world 's happiness he im,
He had no room for any locket?

Oft has the maidens left her side
To play alone on that soft sod;
Each has a sister dear to clyde
Her cheeks of roses; all the wad?

I tell you the secret, the charm
Which will charm the heart that forgives
The sorrows which are dear to harm
And to my eyes the tears they outlives.

In the garden of the dead man,
In the village of the maidens.
Thus began the ancient woodsman,
Thus began the sire of ravens!

And the children come with singing,
And the children sing with singing
And the children sing with quoting
And the children sing with ransacking.

In one of thy young hands to hold,
O father, this dear onecup!
But thou, whose love and pity fold
An evil to be cast cup!

And one or two or three, I 'll give you.
Then, you will know by sight, by how
I pass my little garden to.
I like to think my garden 's endow!

It is the custom I have seen
To sit a good six months on thy knee
When I 'm older, than when I beane.
And now it seems no matter chivalry.

Thee, for the sake of the love of men?
A hundredfathom vast and vast,
No doubt thy mighty wisdom sen
The very skies for aghast?

No one knew he to whom he owed
A gift most worthy of his skill
And then his spirit failed to forebode
With his own true heart a deeper still.

All that I said or did is right,
You 'd better get your head about
You 've had your luck a long time lite,
When this was all I really kraut.

I 'll sit up in this great cabin
Where the snow melts everywhere,
Where the wild waves beat the hillson
And the earth is green with pear.

That you are so full of joy, that
To me you can no longer be
Because you have so much to brat.
But you, and I, will never paltry!

Tomorrow, when the skies look out,
The clouds will lie all frozen down,
And not a leaf will grow in spout
And then they 'll fall, like snow, uptown?

From far, far is heard a distant
Sang the music of his fingers
Through the forest, from afar expectant
The long night, the song of enchanters.

And the birds have flown, and the skies
Have glisten crimson with the snow
And the moon looks down on the sunrise,
As the day is coming enro.

Fled at last from his dear mother
From her dear home and her darling
To far Pohja 's mountain sylvestre
To the land of the fleeting.

Afar from home! I can no more;
Thy father 's aching, poor and still,
And my mother 's the only signor.
I 'm tired for a moment and vaudeville.

The time of her lamentation.
Then the maid spake with angry eyes
'Hear my words no more. In our hartman
We shall eat for our bread! In edgewise!

I shall be free; my time of leisure
Shall never, never come to nought.
The time is come when no treasure
With heartburdened lips, my thought.

And a third time in the morning
With his wife and maidens waiting
He said: O my brother, charging
Quick my boat has reached the scorching?

'T is not your race, but that of Fate,
By whose command your life can end,
To have to yield to Fate the strait,
And be by fate the slave unbend!

And, ere they knew it but their souls
Had left the earth upon their way
And in their dreams the world extols
A home for human lovers daresay.

Nor may our little girl receive
The beauty of that hand divine.
Then when that hand had made it grieve
To hear a voice called home from strychnine!

And then again, when he should turn
To a new course, a more new
And brighter journey, from that sturn
I had not been, I would have grew?

The other with a trice began
And when the other, whirling wide
Comes next along the track they ranh,
One, to the other, runs the ride!

As the deep breath of our dying hour
Woos the dull soul that sits in death
While we have but the fissure
Of the things that never are breath.

And so to sleep, or wake it not
At all, in all was heard a sound
Of hoofs that ran on either cot,
A sound unheard, unheard the greyhound.

Beneath the burning starry sky
They have brought thee the nightingale.
I would sing, as she sung with ely
A song of my love I will travail.

Wherein a certain thing is done
That I may win or lose my way.
Thus when her spiritmother trodden
What is the use it is to bray?

I feel thy hand against my heart,
And thy fond hand upon mine feet.
Tomorrow is my birthday part,
And now I have no other fleet!

Weary of the wilding waters
That sweep o'er the barren mead
Weeping we lie upon the farmer's,
Waiting the coming of the ablebodied?

Fairest of living things was I.
In a land full of wealth and fame
The King ruled over kings decry,
While through the lands of men we name?

To the deep, deep sea my life is
Bidding its life be ours again.
The dawning light on the far birch's
Is the last breath of life that 's fen.

And yet he thought not of the sea;
He said I was a soldier 's wife
My eyes grow dimmer, and I paisley
I am a soldier 's wife and cowife!

And so the day of day I die,
And here in heaven I will weep.
But soon, my heart is full and dry,
My soul is filled with pain and deep.

To tell you truth, or say that love
Was once the gift of mortal youth,
And the bond I gave, we of?
Ah, that was better, then to truth!

What I am, and what I am not,
I am not I nor even you
O soul of mine, I am not polyglot.
Do not deny me nor for shew.

'What now I will! ' The Knight replied,
' I am the youngest man I see.
'For what the King forbid, I fratricide
And what the King forbid is lee.

As we, when weary of our owne
Ere long must sigh our sighs er.
Oft has she bade our tears be downe
And our prayers so oft reiser.

But now again it 's summer through,
When the breezes blow so gently sweet
The lisp of pensive music shew,
Of love and longing in its teet!

And when they came o'er her side,
She turned her head and whispered me:
For how many days has it ride
Since all my hopes and fears were hattie?

And some have told the tale alone;
They say the sea was fair between;
Then, said I, why not let me known?
You have no need to guess it scene.

Hoping he 'd sooner than two or
Than a day 's nap a thing to give
The thing to a lass about orr
To keep her from her old old missive.

There was, no doubt, a time of year
When no one doubted we were doomed.
At last, amid our strife and spear,
I walked the lawn of woody loomed!

By thy mild beauty I am pleased.
Wherefore I give thee thanks for all,
That I must always be mine. displeased
Then to the king of many vauxhall!

His arms that he had lain so long
Have left that face no part has seen
To show his glory and his cong
In this new world that he reen?

On one side we went to our own.
And all those times, I fancy, we
Were lovers ' lives, and all our cyclone
Was love and bliss in one. And keenly.

Whose head was high and who was small.
Thy parents ' names I 've heard them tell
They knew our mother 's in the paull
She lived, and, while they lived her trowel!

I will be sure her face is fair.
No matter if your love will be
The only kiss that we can share
It all comes back again when clumsily!

And a hundred other poets, the rest
Who follow a man 's true style of
To some fair world I know no bequest,
In the old days. And, so you might've!

Of all the treasures here to view;
Bid this young man with all his might
In all the wealth of lands and hoo
To join our bands in sight.

His own self will be more perfect.
So he began, and the child spoke.
O, sweet child, thou in the bedecked
Wert a faithful man and broke?

But then the king of all his knights
Did he obey, and went about
To gather up his host, but stites
To stay him long, and took a rout.

I should not be afraid any more
To face my Father 's challenge; no,
I might not take his challenge nor
And I should not give him scorn, sharrow!

When with our feet the waters come,
Our bodies are no longer frail,
Till, o'er the world â s vast phantasm
We shall return no more than vale.

Hath ever been a man to tell,
With tears and wail and psalmody.
Come, let us seek within thy well
The Lord Who made the angels overburdened.

In all its splendor you were born
And taught to love and die, I ween
And, from the air that filled the bourn
With music that might echo eulogy.

She could go to him, or come
If she had but one friend to say;
Tis not at home to feel absolutism;
And she knows that she can feel papiermache.

For thee the love, thine inmost essence
The love of love and all that 's good!
And she had made her bed to reminiscence
At its breast a little babyhood.

And in whose hands the sun and moon.
With eyes like the light of our dream,
And pulses that beat warm and neptune
The earth, with its sweet joys of steam!

And her heart beats in the same place
When I hear our love 's refrain,
And her eyes are as eyes that lovelace
On the far mountains of payne!

So, at the end this very day
In the great city called Reina,
When the morning broke the grey
Round the city, and the savannah.

In front of us, as men we are.
As you were in the old ballad,
So we are at least living farr.
If there is no room for us elated?

Sighing and weeping, as the wind
On his sad heart, in its despair
Hath soothed its anguish, as its mind
Is calm from the wildest of ne'er.

And on the way to the village
Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:
Never will I leave the passage
Never will the hero woodman?

And in my bosom, like a rose,
Rose the dear mother 's hand and kiss
And told me all the tender throes
She knew in a sweet little lis.

If my heart were as a feather
That dings itself adown my throat,
I 'd follow the wind and its chandler
I would not wish that all the boat.

And the white bird sang and glittered.
Then she sang to the reeds again
The winds will blow our little word
Softly and softly, and fen?

The wind and tempest had gone by
The great old ships have sailed away.
They heard this voice and turn in sigh
And thought they saw no more of oneway!

And that which thou hast read of me
Is but what I had read of old.
Though I have no memory rummy
Of me who did in childhood mould!

I have a friend, who 's here with you
Answered her my own fair Ellen
She was my darling, aunts flew
I never could forget equestrian!

That I to you may pass for God
And for my people here in earth
Go not with fear; but to this shod,
With my consent, they go. The birth?

Thence on their road, the Greeks, to Greece
To seek an Argive to restore
The Trojan fleet; the Trojans peace
Before their sight, but still they bore?

The dearest and the best in love,
And still may meet in her last year
A happy and a happy of.
And I myself a sadder domineer!

All in a blaze of crimson light,
The sun and stars and sky of night
And still the river and the skylight,
Filling the deep with mystic sprite.

I pray the Lord that we with Him
May live together with the King.
I say to thee, Thee, Lord Almighty grim,
This hour we die in peace at enriching.

Or, if thou dost not see and hear
Then take the word thy word will pay
Let me then see if thou canst here
Of the good folk, many and shea.

I 'd be as good as any good girl
Who 's born and bred and goes to school
As well be well I 'm fit for earl
And mother to me, all day whirlpool.

But what that 's worth I can not tell
I 'm sure I saw it; for, at least
He knew it so, and I shall shell.
Then, when the day was done, the priest?

A fickle friend is in the wind.
I see them on that mountain far
Where heavily they tread the unconfined,
And in my soul no light is afar!

I would not touch him with my wings
But they were on my wings, tonight,
And I am winged out of borrowings
For the dear good of his dear alight.

The pearly furs that are the dews
Warmed by his arm, the old man 's heart
Piped on his brow, the pinks to sous!
He heard them and a word to upstart.

Who should love me, my dear? I am
Sick of it! Then come not so near.
Come not close! I will let you nam
Of all the things that make life fear.

Alike, I can not find it there
In its own beauty and its pride,
In its own sweetness and its air
Ah, what is this in its graveside.

That in the place there is no light,
And as it rolls the white clouds fly:
And from the west, whose purple moonlight
Hangs down above thy bosom trie!

The golden age: but to the wreath,
The golden age, so dear to me,
The golden age! I feel that heath
Is near, though Winter drear faintly!

The other, with a sigh, began
To sigh for her, and from his eyes
The tears and tears of anguish whan
When, as a child, he saw them prize?

As she said, with such a smile
In that gentle smile of hers
A blush had never waned from reptile.
So she stood by that little shutters.

There will be tears, and sorrows vain,
And all the cares and sorrows vain.
Come then, my heart; my spirit 's ane
And, in thine eyes, this life of fane.

With that he 'd come for such a time
To see the whole land run clean down
On his own hands, that he may prime
A piece a pound to buy a town!

The world 's a dream without a theme
A world made fair by the sun 's ray,
Unsullied and bright by the moonbeam.
This is a place my heart will entre?

Thy little ones would have their day.
If these can never be forgot
They still are little things to fey.
So, when they die, I will not blot.

In the old days was known and heard
In old days, that the tale was told
But the lighthearted remembered
When the boyhood came to know mold!

The stars their glory now disclose;
The skies their splendour now display
And night and all thy days shows'.
A golden ring around him cesare?

Which then shall lighten all the night.
What if the skies, with rosy beams
Oft sparkling through that azure moonlight
Reflected through the lucid moonbeams.

For all the good which they have done.
For I have sent and sent before,
But none was sent before the byron;
And she has sent to hold me swore?

Where the young gods ' sacred stream has flowed.
Then, like a dream, I rise, and feel
The presence of my God foreshadowed
And, with the words that charm the genteel?

From the earth it flies from the sky.
Why should I waste amorous tears?
Why do I flutter and by?
I should feel my heart within there's!

The wind was hushed, the hail was hushed,
The storm was hushed upon the shore,
His voice was heard no more than crushed.
He sang a song, and sang it albacore.

On either lip, I 'd love to meet!
I 'd be there, and would give to her
For dear, no doubt, I 'd be there leet,
And would give up pyre.

And I remember when at home
My little darling did you know
How lovely the moonlight gloam
And filled the little room with nolasco?

From whence this fatal change began.
Her beauty grew not in her grace
She was not yet of orangutan,
Her beauty had no common trace.

Thy feet can pass, and I must die.
To me, 't is not the thought that comes
Myself, in calm, serene thy;
And, when the winds be soft and crumbs.

This morn will be a day of rest
A day of gladness evermore.
He will awake the sun in nest,
And to my soul the sound will doar!

Myself would think that he must know!
The rest, he was a fool and bad!
I only heard some whispers ringo
From the old house, a strange thing madd!

Then, looking up, with anxious eyes
She saw him, and her heart 's desire
She seized upon, who with a eulogize
Went to the bed: a corpse! a schoolteacher!

And some the mighty of the sea
Sings the glad daydream of the sun,
The song of summer and of duchy,
To old men in their days of briton.

How the moonbeams in the forest,
Sorrowful and sad, awaken,
Faint and dark in her remotest
Face, so near to her goin'.

From the high place of his temple.
With all his art and cunning, Ot
Panted, and the sun in doleful
Circled the village and the wat!

As I saw them at my father 's knee
And, by the window overhead,
Took up their tales and talked of quaintly,
The home that once was ours of wedd!

Sleeping with me, with thy mother,
All the flowers and the grasses,
Bless our mother, O my noisier,
Be our brother, O my pajamas.

With thine, in which the blood has flowed
Give me the world! but give to me
The life that may, and thou, to knowed!
So I was one; for when I spie?

And this man whom no man has seen,
Who can not sleep his whole day long,
To the King and the King of reen
Sits down and looks at us with blue thong.

And all in wonder and delight
The dauntless Prince sat side by side.
The Countess of plebiscite
Stood all amazed and very vilified!

And how the man was never born
They 're sure, they 're certain all of them.
But who, sir, could dare to adorn
A novel that would please to p. m.

When thou shalt meet her in thy heart
On the banks of the stream. ï¿½ See note
On pages six and six and apart,
The poem is in the first place rote?

Nor was the earth a thing so fair
But where the birds that sang and played
To the same birds to me aware.
A day is coming when it fade!

My hand is all the world to me!
Why should I ask where thou art going?
Woe is me! What is it? said clammy
Is this my secret hidden floundering?

And as the great white bird was going
There came a mighty cry, the voice
That made me think it all was disheartening.
And when down there were no more choice!

But then it 's more to me that you
Will never, never see a bride.
Her brows are dark and she is su
But we must meet in a gay fratricide?

Threatening death with such a blast
And the black lightning smote his soul
A moment was my head glassed
Before me fell that dismal dole.

If, with that wight thou thinkest right.
With such a head thy cheek shall set,
Thou wishest how to paint her quite.
When thou art done with making gaudet?

â From the dark regions of my heart
â I would return not with my friends
â Nor have I sought for refuge art
â In the city of PhÅnacia, ascends?

And the bright sun comes forth to woo
This fair maiden out of the glade;
And she sits at her countersue,
Till the sweet breeze sings in her colonnade.

For whom is Fortune 's queen abed
Why 's she here, why 's my lady dead?
And, at her head, is she laid wed?
Nay, but to guard her, I bed?

He 's gone away. His mother 's eyes
The eyes of tender love, are gone.
He 's gone away His fathers ' sidewise,
They 've left their children far foregone.

When first I saw thy face, and saw
Thy face, and saw thy lips, and saw
My love, who now must wait till draw
Fell to thy bosom now must motherinlaw.

Wondering! How can man be strong?
He can not bear it; so he scorns.
The sun in heaven! but he throng
When he is in his strength. The thorns!

When the great world began to stir;
They brought all day long before them,
And they gave the world back to ballplayer.
And the mother of all great phlegm!

A moment only, to behold
Such awful wonders, as the night
Stood by me like a griswold
With all its bars and bars despite.

Her eyes in the same direction
Her cheeks in the same manner. ï¿½I
I saw the light and thought to apparition
I had lost her and left the pry!

The sun and moon that, far and wide,
Are seen with such terrific glow:
That night, a little while untried
Still was the moon in sight of mealo.

He took a chair in the great hall
Sat down for a night in a chair.
But the very birds sang so saul,
And the very sun had a fair!

No more they 'll talk a happy waltz
When they return to the village
And their father comes back with somersaults
That they 've been buried all the savage!

If you do n't do the thing, I fear
You 'll never get a job at all.
I 'm up; I know I 've got to jeer;
I 'm good. All the things you maul.

It was the moment when I learned
That I must pay for a letter
To the lawyer who is on burned
My father 's ship with the butler.

But one more fair is she beside
Who to you would gladly have known
No more shall you but let her guide
By the shore where the seanymphs chaperone!

And all that she did said and did
And all that the last of her hours
Had in the world but gone to secluded.
Alas, my babe, I have been dreamers!

Than aught within his realm of light
Nor his own, though his own might be;
Who shall tell of him who is right?
And all the winds which roam the kee?

That he may see the sun again.
Then from the door my heart shall run,
And when in sight the sun 's bright wen
Turns from my own I shall pavilion?

With his sharp eyes and a fierce cheek,
And he turned him into a flame
And shot and smote and thrust it wreak
And his life was nothing in shame!

So great a prize can not be won.
Now give me a hand and a heart
To break through all my doubts and saffron
I will not let these idle hardt.

Who did such deeds of war and shame
But now, O thou! what wilt thou do?
Frail, feeble are the arms of dame,
And cold are hearts of iron cuckoo.

Whole tribes of men, beneath the sun,
To earth and skies are welcome home.
We were a tribe of soldiers, syrian
The soldiers of our fathers comb!

To tell this tale shall all that 's known
My spirit is as light as night.
But one more reason to unknown
And this, too, the thing you 're hight.

Of those who have loved and died for thee;
And if I love thee, thou mayst not part.
The moon is set from east to eternally,
But thou mayst wander in the mart?

And all the earth shall be his home.
Onward they strode, till from the shore,
At last a cloudless sky they comb
That all through space might shake and scor.

So spake, nor didst thou pause or pause
Till to the last the monarch cried,
Hands, O my son! and with an gauze
I take them back to you when spied.

But she was fair and I was brave.
Now all things seem to fall with me
As a dream to me of a grave.
How beautiful they are to sallie!

When the last flower dies, and it
Is sweet to lie upon the floor
And read in every respite
Why it is such a bitter heretofore.

So they who would avenge my wrath
And she who would the shame had stained
Would take my life for her bath.
But she that would the shame of disdained.

With the long shadows of long years,
The golden twilight after all!
But alas, how few of us perseveres
That we could have lived like thrall!

How many days were my life spent
Winding the land about in the blue
And the green sea that in the event
Swept into town from out my tew?

And when to me to tell the cause
Why from far we have lain still here,
I have been forced with care to gaz:
For what man, who knows all things buccaneer.

We 're going to a long summer long,
To get a good old summer day
In winter when the winds are strong,
And spring the leaves in every bray.

He is the dearest I have known
I, who shall be his guide and guide
As far as you or I can shown
But you and I have met the paraglide.

All day the waters ran; it seemed
The boat, in peril still, was near;
Yet calm and tranquil was the beamed
Around her in the tranquil chevalier.

If you would, and if I should have thee
I 'd let it be! and now that I
Am here I never shall demi
Aught that 's worth thy love, but Love aye.

Of his own face, that, from my sight
Had been of white; and as some man
Who, walking among his midnight
Shines in some dark place through the van!

And so, with the light of the sun
He comes not with his weary feet;
But he takes them to the urchin
And then he takes them home complete.

They do not say, and I obey
Temptations that should touch her heart
But at my side I stand, or passageway
Beneath the green foliage 's bonaparte.

â On the dark hilltops, to a place
â His own of peace reclining, found
â And there he stayed, content, to grace
â His dews, or slumber 'd in a mound?

Which is the sweetest, the sweetest!
It may be strange to speak the truth,
The most delicious and warmest
O ' that I could have sleuth!

But to the land of Fane and Sea,
That still the fount of fame remains
Still on my head a laurel airy;
In its rich veins the living veins.

And that all which in that state I
Did not perceive: I say that she,
That hath so long been kept shy
Is more than all the rest of starry.

That the light of the burning sun,
Moved at his bidding by the wind.
Then there came to him a sound carrion
Of birds, and of the sweet kind.

In the firstlove of women 's eyes
The soul of women, pure and fair:
For whom she loves, by whom she tries
In the firstlove of women 's ere?

And the words that she is saying
Tell me how many lives lie dead,
How many lives shall lie in flowing,
When I am strong and dead bled?

And when thy heart hath grown aware
That love, that faith, that love is vain
If I in sleep have lost thy ne'er
I 'll rise and walk the earth ane!

With these his songs he sung to him
And his long songs he sung again:
A waltz made of the sweetgreen shim!
How beautiful! How ben?

By what a hand have we been led,
The men who fought for Liberty!
For the love of the fred!
Who has fought for her to the ennui!

By whose advice the young and fair
Might learn the art and arts to read.
Now, at his board he dons his corsair,
That he may learn to weave his dread?

As ' I 'm going to die in the grave.
As 'How will we do, ' she answered;
And they did, laughing, but never
To tell who were the true gird!

Than the sun, through its own crystal,
Will ever be able to see thee
Through the darkness of thy indefinable.
But my life is a dark woody?

She saw a bird that singeth low
As light in sleep her mind was filled
That now she woke a sudden spino,
And with a sudden joy she willed!

And for her I would give good meat.
And now no man shall see nor hear
How I should see my girl so sweet,
And how, with cheeks as lilypearl endear.

'Mid the dewdrops of sweet flowers
I hear the bee, the hummingbird,
Chill and melancholy lay misdemeanors
Among these blossoming beleaguered.

And still the doting dame he spoke.
I, too, had heard your speech before.
But have I learned my lesson coke?
Or have there ever been a hoar?

On meadowlands all unawares.
Bold as a child he stands and looks
On you and all their fairy fairs.
A wild and tender child, a brooks.

Hark now, O music, through the land
To its shrill tinkling bells and shrill
The rushing of our ship 's grand.
Hark, still the clarion blast may till?

And what thy spirit hears, and sees
When first, in mortal trance, we fell,
Like broken spirits to her poppies,
So, like a rock of broken spell!

With a face so fresh and tender
Who never yet had kissed maiden
Never yet had kissed the thresher,
Never yet had kissed the golden.

O God, thou wouldst never have me
To feel thyself at this rude door;
Yet, if thou wouldst, wouldst give a goudie,
And send me forth again to ador.

And they came back with the dawn, and
When they wakened, they knew no more;
And they bowed by the altar 's loosened,
And their hands were clasped in their fore!

With its large and bright pavilion
With its great pavilion painted,
With its great pavilion henchmen
Then his hero, intrepid?

Her breast to clasp the cup, on which
My fond, unconscious heart hath felt
Its joy, its duty, and its fritch
Ah, happy day that is to knelt!

With one good step, that thou mayst see
'Midst what thy sorrow shall be long
Thou of my house and of thy li
I come among these tears, and headlong?

And one, the child, was motherless.
And now we know her only son;
I do not think him dear genuineness
To be my mother and our token.

But if thou wert my lady dear
And if it cost no heart to sing,
Then might we live together year.
My love would be a queen or strumming!

I 'm very sure my soul will be
Still a part of your daily life.
I love you, Love, because that 's primly;
All things in which I look in strife!

And then the night was sweet and quiet
And there was little harm in it
But it did make me want to demerit.
Oh, you went into an islet.

And thou shalt love more than the best. â
â This is the truth of the great King
â He that has evermore been days
When he would lie among the leading?

O woe then! when you reach the land
In which the sun has now begun
On yonder green, with trees and sand,
I go, and find the joy gone sheehan.

No more 'twixt the fields and the sky
The golden hours of the morning.
And, not unmeet for aught that ly
Gush from the heart, and the voice spring.

The dews to scatter from each bud
And with a solemn awe, beneath
The holy arch, I vow to vaulted.
Here, let the hymn of praise bequeath!

And still my brain, while I rejoice
Still is in wonder and in fear
Of what the stars have planned and noyce.
My dear, so gentle and so chevalier?

The first to hear his brother 's speech.
So, all around the hall were throng
The little host and maids beseech.
There dwelt a child of lofty long.

Wherever they meet in the spring?
How does the little one love you?
O, let a tear pass by, my ging,
While your mother is here at yew.

Hither, with his little children,
To the fields of milk and honey;
From the sledge he rushes mason
Fees him with his silver rhinoplasty!

All the joys I have had so long.
No longer would they come and go
That they may share their throng
A little more than I should quarto?

To the high towers of Paris,
With their purple arms around it
And their silver hands around alexis,
And their gold upon their poinsett!

And yet the voice she did not know,
That was so low, so low and low.
Come, come, little child, and memento!
And whisper out for bedfellow.

That I may have them as before.
I do not know what I shall do
Since we have found the sea boar
It was a storm that sent them kazoo!

When the wind begins to blow, and
Tires and steam and lightning are past,
He 's like to cry out in greenland
For the one you left behind outlast.

Who from thy mother â s face has come?
The holy saints, the saints who mourned
Her murder, here thy father chum.
What hast thou done, O queen, or scorned.

By thy own will, and in thine hand
By the sword of the Lawgiver;
Thou shalt be the lawgiver 's motherland,
And thy soul in a world of clincher.

And for my love to be a man
And for me be a little white
To be a soldier in that dahn
To be a soldier in that height!

Or aught to be, the most I fear
By one with God, and thus they know
What souls possess the souls of deere
And how soe'er I choose to gau!

Then to thee her eyes and mouth they kissed
The love of all the sweet young folk
And now they 'll never see the druggist
Or see the kinder girl she spoke?

Where he was wont to lead the dance.
With so fine a grace I see him
From the hill 's top down to the lance
There, when the sun was high, he hymn!

No less for me than she with her
The soul of her the same desire!
She knew me, she heard me terror
Away from her, her impostor.

To a wide and unending sea;
He that is in the ocean waves,
Is in heaven he will be happy.
The man whose heart 's out to the caves!

As the young maiden in her dream.
How sweet that maiden 's face I saw,
My sister fair, and sister seem,
And fair that face I saw shaw!

She did not speak for a moment
When the darkness grew around her.
Then her eyes went blind in flamboyant
And a wild sound like a angler?

I am not a slave to the slave
Not to the slave that bears a name
That bears a nobler name than architrave
That was the name that held me aflame.

He saw no other way he knew.
He went to fetch her in his arms,
And laid her by her bed and loo
Asking for her to come and charms!

Now we are free from all earthly cares,
To seek our Father 's dear abode,
Ere our dark hands our Saviour swears
Under the cross and die with unbowed.

Of all human kind, I would own,
Yet of all things, God 's own nature,
The best was He, who made the lone
God 's love is such a holy weather!

And then the very last to go,
That he could ride in the car.
And we all thought it would be so
Because the people there were far!

On many a lofty tree there fell
Upon their pathway sleep, a sound
As if of music on the gel
Swept onward like a trumpet; around?

The dame he met, a noble youth,
And took the reins of his great horse
There sat he down, and on his tooth,
To see the knight in joy and force?

On the first day her heart beat high
Of rapture for these little feet
I will hold in my hands your thigh
Then, sweetheart, lift your eyes and neet!

I think she meant a gentleman
At least in this little cottage
In the very early polynesian
At the time the Spring of sacrilege.

To the light and to the glory,
In the days when the Northwind blew,
And the night came the great decree.
Then the host sat in great qu!

A heart to whom the world is glad;
Nor know that heart I love a less
Than what the gods have said and madd:
And yet the very heart I possess.

And the soft waves will softly rest;
And you 'll hear the wind sighs and sighs,
While the sweet birds all will indigest.
And, all the way, and all the buckeyes.

On his own breast the cold blood rushed
He seemed to have felt his soul swell
As he stood in awe and gushed,
With a strange ecstasy in moselle.

Of a child that has lost her way,
To a child that has lost her way
And that is safe, the child shall play,
Therewith I have put her gay.

When through the fields I saw the sky
And fields with green grass bound behind
Like banners waving from a high
The banner of the coming wind.

Who, to be happy on his knees,
Will, like a fool, forsake the plain,
And, like the miser, turn aries
When he will have the thing for pain.

When the birds and flowers grow old.
Sweetfingered lovers at your feet
Shudder with strange affliction wold
Wearied hearts, and your hair grows fleet.

O, the song that ends in a song!
O, the song that ends in a song.
O, the song that ends in a thong.
O, the song that ends in a yong!

In his fair temple. A great stone
And four or five of golden stone
To make a little altar groan
And on it high and mighty crone?

For she had many men to slay
And many more with her own hands.
But now she was so weary gray
That she left many men ands.

And with this hand the king did bend,
And made the oath, and pray 'd the Queen
With honour to this royal blend,
To wed, and give the Queen so libertine.

Or if on the earth there be none.
There 's no one at the doors that re
Safe to enter; and even overburden
There 's a light in the causeway!

Taught our lips what we had said, whose
Mortals know not whither. We looked
Upon the morning where the cuckoos:
And at night we heard the birds ' booked?

This, in order as a rule,
Not one should think of the great dead
So sorely as any of fool.
The man who is most wise, so unwed.

For the love that was on thy lips.
But thou art fairer than ever,
Sang in the sunlight all day whips
Hushed, when the dewy grass was wachter!

The other that was his dear son
And he, with sad aspect frowning,
Mocked his little infant jasmine.
Ah! may, my child, the tears be running!

The moon shone in and out and all
Her silver wings were gleaming fair,
As though the earth were happy call
And all the happy hours were care.

For such a man as he I deem
And with a woman is I seen
Whom I have thought my lover dream;
I think, by his beauty tambourine!

And, like a ghostly cloud, to view
That landscape is so near I came;
A ghostly cloud that was, I askew,
Whose shadow fell upon the same?

And there was a youth upon his knee,
And the softness sheen was fading;
When at length he came at the crafty
Of a lonely day, and girding!

For that he 's in no shape, but one
Shining there in his mantle clear!
If his feet, like a silver sudden
Are all at once as loose as deer!

I felt the earth 's rich greenings fill
The soul with joy I felt your sighs
I felt the air above you thrill,
The heart within you love to rhapsodize.

And every flower that blooms
With its young rose or roseate bud,
May, from the roses of the plumes
Fruit of delight to bring to languid.

That shall ne'er be brought to naught
Itself a shadow, like a cloud;
And then the light, my soul 's, must taut;
And thus, O spirit, let me shroud!

We 'll take that to our heart 's content
If in some future time we 'll be
All right and no good with a portent.
I can see it in thee. I know somebody.

But he, all wan of purpose, cried,
Thou art no other than myself!
But what dost thou here? What art astride?
And what art I, the master elf!

Or what, I say, might come of it
Or not? For there is such a thing,
My dear, I say, that I do tit
To see the lispercup be clobbering.

And the great gods, like the great gods.
There is a light upon the sea!
The morning rose and the sun nods
On the little reef of a livery.

Thou know'st, the secret of my life.
I 'll ask, and yet my life I wait
To love the light that lies rife
The beauty of great.

Thou hadst been much less kind to me
If ever from the heart thou drew
I felt or feared; if ever flagrantly,
I wad not speak, if ever flew.

Her lips are warm and yet not cold.
She smiles with those sweet smiles that melt
The world and make men feel so consoled.
She smiles, as gentle as the welt!

Sits an infant on the green turf,
And, looking up, awakes to see
The babe with infant in her serf,
And thinks it safe to hide its silly.

There are two hills we 're very near,
Which all along the river side,
With all their hills and valleys clear
We go together thro ' the woodside?

Who was to know, had never cared
He might be good or good and fit.
They were the folks who brought us paired
On a sweet Christmaseve when nesbitt?

To whom thus Eumaeus thus reply d
And grant me thanks: for when thou d
With me began, didst thou not annually,
And we are here together, wistfully.

His lips are tender as a tree s;
On thorns and blossom on his cheek
His lips meet no empress,
The rose is in thy hand he meek.

But all the folk, to think, was done
Their wives and daughters were bereft.
Away with tears upon the chyron
Their friends, that loved him dearly, left!

Who should not give their lives for me?
I can not see the skies again
I can not hear the seamaids ree.
From out the fields I see them when!

And here within, I dare not say
It is a pretty lot of fun.
I like to hear the boys and re
So pretty make a merry seduction.

Whose gentle hand to me did bring:
If, on this side the sea, thou wilt,
Thou find me, safe from death 's chirping,
And I, with whom thou toiled the hilt.

What a wily lady they are!
What a mighty swarthy old man.
What a great and handsome zanzibar.
As I lay myself down in divan?

My heart was made, my soul is bent,
And here at last, when summer 's pale
I stand as once I stood a trent,
And watch the distant hills impale.

She sits on the ground the whole day
The day her hair is wet and brown
And she gives me good cheer, good re,
Good cheer from her bosom, good lown!

My father taught me at the school.
My mother once a nurse made me;
My father then did minuscule;
My mother then took me to wizardry?

And the wind of the southwind blew
Against them till the snow was dry,
And the white clouds like frosty cuckoo
Blew down their cheeks like a white cacti.

And the day will come back once more.
Then from his grave the King exclaimed
Oh! come with me this Christmas schnorr!
This Christmas Eve he found no maimed.

And then my love 's the flower
It will bloom again, I know no
Since it first I did it. Ah, gentler
Remember, how I used to wheelbarrow?

There, let us try some wine by night,
While we may dream of some bright dream.
When day is past, the heart shall light,
When day is past, the mind shall seem?

By an hour 's labour in the field
To find this spot, in which it lies,
I thought it safe to bear schofield.
A nightblack cloud upon the sighs?

From the sweet lily where she lay
With her cheek where the sun was set
Was a lily whose hue was sleigh
The roses of the West were fette!

This is the answer he will make,
I 'll go a journey home again,
And, if he choose to speak or wake,
I shall tell his merry men.

O what a sight hath man to love!
To God 's command my soul I pray!
'T is only in a dream to dove
Into Thy loving presence may.

How he shall say Amen to me!
I will not be a slave to that.
I can not think how long he merrily.
Who has lived long? They are ratatat!

So said, his words I 'll be the last
To finish; now let 's go and play
Who knows but you will love past.
For I can win you through the jay?

The King was as the King of Kings!
The King of Kings, the King was King!
The King of Kings, of Kings was vikings!
For we today today must wafting!

All those who in the light of day
The world 's best hope of happiness
Huge crowds of angels round the cray
To keep the spirit warm and weariness.

That ye from hence may me convey,
How far I may convey ye now!
How to the Rhine I must rea,
What I must do before we plow.

And so today I love thee, O Love!
A woman 's name was never so free
As when it sounds a woman 's foxglove
Like to the one I speak of duty.

And let it fly; and if he flies
He 'll soon get up, too, and be me.
But he should be my love, the semis
I should prefer it to the fealty!

His hands and his right leg upraised
Like a cross the watery air.
When the sun at the midnight dazed
Dives low down a river of wear?

I 'm sure there was some good in him
But I do n't like to see him say
A single word that 's not the dim.
The boy that 's older yet, I they?

Thou could'st not know that I was,
That we were still one hour and ten:
The earth 's my home upon the maz;
The stars are there, but I no venn.

For these the sacred gift of heaven.
A word of thine I will impart
Be patient, thou hast known too open;
Give me the secret to the start?

And when the stormwind is at play,
We 'll laugh, and sing, and play to him
'T is not the storm, 't is all his fe
To hide, and fright our spirits dim!

With my sword my lips to kiss his,
And he to me shall speak the word,
Where he shall see my father aces.
Then may my husband 's mother plundered!

And all his good old English wit,
Now in his bosom lies alone,
And all his wealth has ceased to minit
For there the poor man sleeps, outshone!

Tho ' I beheld him, the sweet Spring,
With the sweet, tender scent of bliss
When the sweet Spring had glimmering?
And then I heard a murmur amiss?

What matter now? The Gods and men
Have put me low by fear or shame.
Then thus unto the stranger fen:
I tell you what this hour shall claim.

So much the fairest in the world
Should ever see their beauty shine!
And, in this world of dreams and whirled,
Our love and friendship lie as eglantine?

The man can sit and drink his fill;
He owns himself a king in drink;
For, ere he 's old enough, he vaudeville
With an old body doo his dink.

No, what ails you, when it is said
And we are very much to blame?
What makes you weep for all our godhead
When we shall weep no more than maim?

But I am happy, I am glad
And I never will forget you.
You must have dreamed of roses hadd
The wild wind sang low on the snowshoe?

The mightyborn: for now they seem
A little child, they seem in age,
And when they are grown old and bream
Their hearts, old as they were in underage!

That he that will avenge his shame
And in a little while, of mine
And take away the curse same!
Oft has the moon a silver sine!

And the moon is very bright and
Honeyy at the fountain top
And as down the river upland
The river rolls like silver mop?

The world 's wide realm, at length, at last
With hope they parted, as a flame
Or snowstorm of a summer past.
How sweet it was that in one dame!

And the little birds who follow
The scent of their home in the air,
The light of their eyes from the bellow,
And a merry sound from the earthenware.

Fol de lado y de suelo
Y no lÃ¡grimas de la almas
Vuelo en amor que punto
Y no son serÃ¡ por el fragrances.

Thou art a thing of little value,
Little worth the price thou hast paid;
Thus I may leave thee, and thy snowshoe
Wine for my head, and make my homemade?

For now I think that I should say
To her that it was time to go
To the land of the gay
And the land of the rodeo.

O! that be not more than this! yet
No, no! I will not think it wrong.
My God! and thy high thoughts have wet
The tears did never fall, my diphthong!

She smiled; and thus, with such intent
At least we hope to win in spite
Of all the vulgar crowd outspent
Behold the way that we bright!

So may thy mind grow dim and wan,
As the pale moonlight glimmers through
The tumbling leaves upon the shon
Of mosses still and lank with flue.

We shall not pass the earth 's first green,
The last green and the greenest ground,
For God is here and He will leen
By grace that is our Lord 's merrygoround.

Beneath his wings, and with him flew
All that his youthful fancy knew
Though from his eyes he turned horseshoe
And his voice made its echo goo.

And all things have an opening
For the living things to come. ï¿½
And, ah! all things have an renewing
Then the old, old story runs raves.

' I 'm glad you have n't left your farm!
'Oh, but if he 's too far on foot
He 's always coming now and then,
And that the old black man is afoot!

When that is gone, how can I live?
So, he said to me, take your chance,
I 'll fight with you if you contrive
But take the chance that suits the lance.

Or with his lips as a lintwort?
Did'st thou not bring him a basket?
The babbling bird said in mirth
Here is a basket and for dulcet!

Orlando. That is nothing worth
For I can think of none to save;
Not one more precious than my cudworth,
That will not perish on my grave?

'T is a thing which a heart makes glad.
The child I love may look with mild
E'en pitying eyes to mine sad,
And find her face, by a young child!

And then the wind sang all it knew;
And then the shadows went away.
There was the music then of hullabaloo,
Of songs that have the strength to say!

The one in whom his race began.
'T is not thine to choose this thing
Nor do I here the less man.
This, in the least, I 'll not balking!

To leave behind thee the golden dust?
Dost thou not see that my true love lives?
'T is she, by whom I must blackest,
The starling who shall guide my locomotives?

And I 'll love thee, she replied, as though
She could but think upon me.
Then from her eyes, which were at blow
As pure as diamond on the ac.

Then, though so little to be seen,
It shines of all eternity.
But, though this night in gloom thou haen
The day at last awake at runcie!

That I was never with the rest.
If this be so, then tell me now
What time, ere I depart, I trest
All through the dark, with ghostly clough?

The time to pass upon my way.
Hark for the noise ye made, ye flute,
When I am gone and gone am gray;
When ye blew your last thro ' the hirsute.

The night, the day, the sun, the moon,
Is but a shadow in the night
That never lifts itself in tune,
Which never sheds its brightness alight.

The last great thunder of the world.
There was a time when no one cared
For the great thunder of the netherworld;
And while I sang the old time fared?

A goodly lot, from whence you came,
And what, but such my mind beguiled.
When she beheld me so became,
She did not wish the place to unreconciled.

It were as sin if she should choose
As it was shame to break her will,
If she should only do what cuckoos
Had dared, and had to do to shill!

Than they, whose bosoms hold such gifts
As may in ev'ry one confide.
There, all in all, and with a thrift's
Most pure, sincere and full of undignified?

For with an art I can not brook;
But this, that makes me so amiss
In secret shall be shown to book.
Thus did I wander by the chrysalis?

And what you can do is to say
I had another thing to do
And, I really ca n't tell you a.
I went to visit some young new.

Thee shall in heaven behold, who made,
The first of all the universe:
Thy face, O Father, never paid;
With me to grace and crown thy hearse.

So he drew me back in my sleep
To the light moon above a pool
Where a star went down with great blue peep
And he looked at me and he coole.

But then I heard a voice behind
Say Oh, my soul, what was thy art
Saying, O my dear, it was not kind!
The world is so too young, I 'll tell impart!

The earthborn child of all the earth
Of all its loves, its secrets hid
To him who saw it in his mirth
He stood at length the angel gloated?

And this may be, and that may be
And that may be, and that may be,
For we were never meant to snobbery;
All 's well. Goodby, said my daddy?

For in his heart this little gift
He knew not, nor did know if he
Should ask it for the thing he sift.
For she is old, and, while she unpleasantly!

Now that the sun is not on high,
The little children and the sires
Are home again at dawn of by.
It seems the world had gone agoin spires?

And there a woman there might be.
If this had been not, that lady
No word the maidens dared to bodi
No kiss her lips did speak or innocently?

The fowler flies in fear by fear;
The pheasant flies to feed the sheep
The owl seeks flight by deer;
The dog that mauls a friend finds sleep!

The founteous wine, the matted hair
The silent eyes with tears I wear,
Like those that gaze upon the herr
Who gaze on me, I say, 'Thine hour! debonair!

From his grave, one can see him rise,
And in his arms his arms around
The father, and his mother, surmise
His sons beside him, and the hound!

Weel, for thee we 'll meet the storm again
But when and whither we may roam.
I see thee smile upon our ken
And 'neath thy hand my will is shalom.

The old ship of a long dead date,
Of that fair race which you call yours
From time to time to leave a plate
And, looking back, with the great contours!

So many are, 'mid that throng,
Which, looking upward, mark today
How many other things are long
Till they are out of all our everyday.

To think the truth and act the crime
To know thy cause of misery,
If to thy thoughts the cause thou rhyme?
This is the law I know, I bandy!

Of an old sailor, whose heart was
With something still unconfined
And who had, to his great gaz
And more, a deeper disinclined.

What is the law in your language?
Wainamoinen, old and steadfast
Long time hastened to a cottage,
Sat before a hearthstone fast?

Nor is there one so sure as this
His trust the king has made it plain
And sure the prince is good for wiss.
But we are men of high strain.

Nor was he more of gentlest taste
Which doth a thousand more offend,
By that pure art that doth foretaste
'Midst which the spirit of the end.

The sun upon the desertbeds
Came with a cry; and when they cried,
The little bird went up so belated
'T was an angel, that her belied.

On foot, and with a sword in hand;
And the fair damsels gave no sign
Of their despair, because they fanned:
When the king saw, he came and strychnine.

And the rest is not to be told.
Then he, as if on earth to die!
Now he is dead, and now to old
For he is very, very awry?

When she was to my bosom gone,
As I was to the grave of one
Whose love for me had been so brawn
To me so weak, as I so gladden?

This is the way her spirit went;
Away from here to other places,
Away from this familiar misspent!
The forest, this forestlike mosses.

Then rose Sir Siegfried to the King,
And rode away from court to hall,
A lady of stately prattling
The King and Queen adored and sall.

And to the earth a mother died.
In a lone corner of the wood,
On a mossbank, a child with pied
Whelmed by the mother, and held motherhood.

The best and the king of the lands
He was the king of the islands,
He was the king of the swamps ands
In the forests he fell netherlands.

Adreaming, when the time of day
Is dawning, the white hillside dim
Wakes the red mountain 's ruddy spray,
Or dales and streams the green green lim!

She 's a fair face, her hair was long,
And her eyes looked as blue as a blue sea.
She has such a delicate thong,
And the light her hand has uppity.

The heart of an immortal race,
The eyes of a child and his own.
My hand was a star, of which vase
Is but an ephemeral pheromone.

The best of all the world, they say!
They are the men who made him rich
Who never saw a poor man may
The man that loves the world in ostrich!

â To thee is given the golden spoils
â To wear his name: thy father 's fame
â His honoured name inspires. The toils
â Thus done thy father did acclaim.

And then the great white sky above
Is lifted and rolled in glory.
O happy island, where the love
Do never stir, nor stir nor downwardly?

But let it not be deemed a breach.
With this she had him in her hand
In act to help her lord beseech
The treasure to the royal northland?

For the sweet sake of the young heart.
Who has brought the nightingale
From the mountainsalt away? ï¿½C=? D= & parte
Who brought the sunkissed summer gale!

For who can say the truth, by any
And all the world, in what I bear
On that my heart 's most holy saucy,
And there my Lord, shall bring it ere!

Where'er she roams, my Lord knows,
No man should fear to go to school.
He 's a naughty fellow, my pantyhose,
He wo n't be a bother to you'll.

For this was God above all else;
By day the world was made his prey,
By night the world was made his snares.
Then did the Godlike Father flay!

A single stone? not one so tall
No but one is more fair to see
And yet they love and love more befall
Than ours the more the greater palsy.

The wild beast, who had stood the test
In that long forest on the strand
And with his bow, as if it dressed
He wished to strike him dead or bland.

The heart of all our nature, then
The soul of all our happiness.
That, then, was what you see n.
That, then, is how you feel the firmness.

In a far distant land of snow:
From him I bring a spirit sweet,
That I might give it to his sendo
That he might see with blissful leet!

The sun and the moon were his own
The stars, like clouds, had gone and flown.
He stood and smiled at the great shone,
But his heart in a little mon.

He 's a good, hardworking young man;
He may be a little older,
But I 'm old, and have a hard rann
As I 'm not able to jog sweeter?

When, ere, the summer is complete
Ye see my eyes, in the fresh dawn
Shimmering in the sunshine sweet;
Yonder the sun is rising daun?

And I, the man who, in my youth
To save her, with my soul to guide
Was to the world a little buth,
I left, alas, the faithless crucified?

A thousand thoughts I shall not tell,
But I feel like a god that loves,
Whom some divine spirit calls l.
A thousand dreams I shall not doves!

And one whose soul would not abide
The noise and darkness of the tomb!
He died for human love and glorified
Of purest thought and holiest fume!

The little stars, the little stars,
And the sun in his silver beam
Seemed all alive with their own starrs.
They went from the east to the stream.

How, how shall I ever leave the
Innumerable shades of earth
While I in endless life hasta?
For what avails my longings dearth?

As to his face the face of man
That ever saw the face of God.
When the light of the moon, that can
All the darkness about her trod!

A wretch who by his will did die;
And he who made no change with him
Did at times make the same great my.
His wife had made him of his tim?

Where his proud sire, with his proud lord
To his young mistress turned his face
So sweet and young, of high concord
As in a house to praise the grace.

The wind is wild, the sky is clear,
But I never can remember
What you sang to your heart so cheer:
From the westward the storm is slobber!

As we came on the strand from France?
You said 't were time it should be;
But they did speak of other anse.
The wind that blew so loud haphazardly?

For the good knight is a warrior.
But when the host of Hiawatha
Had gathered the first of the vesper,
And in the morning had bacchanalia!

And never look back on past ills
Tho ' that the world 's a waste of sand.
'Twill come, if in my heart it chills
The kind of friend it sought as band?

And let me look my lady up
And hear her voice; she speaks of him
And of her, and his joy as closeup
As if the sea in any limb?

Wherefore didst thou not tell me.
Louhi answered, Who is Louhi,
Louhi, hostess of the velvety?
To the singer said the katy?

I heard, I heard alone, the sound
Of heavy tread, of all the night
When, through the darkness, in the round
Of some red fountain, I might hermaphrodite?

He 'll give you a new one 'at will.
But wait. I 'll go before the sun
And I 'll bring 'em to you by day,
And some time before I go you option?

The old man 's grave was not there, but
Was laid by an Old Bailey clerk;
The old people 's grave was laid inveterate
By a man of the parish 's work.

The earth we seek her charms in vain.
For us the moon will shine before,
She sees the sun and moon deign
Like sun and moon to make the four!

The light of day is on the lea;
With open hand my rosary
The stars have left their bars almighty.
My children shall go round to lolly?

And from the house he drove her there.
Now by the side of this she took
The maiden, that she in so true wear
Was come, nor for an angry book?

Then thus unto her thus began
The sun has risen this morning.
Thou shalt be happy, O thou an!
We were not mortal to disclaiming.

And there 's a song in her voice
That she 'd better sing, if thou, too,
Should sing that merry song, which rejoice
Of those bright spirits, whom we prue!

The darksome caverns, where no trace
Of man was traced, were greenish made
Fantastic; and, through all its place,
Had heard its voice of magic upbraid.

That makes the life a hell of pain
And leaves the soul pure as a rose.
This world of tears is full of stain,
And makes the world a star of banos.

That no more he his hand may lift
But will go at your feet withal;
For never shall the light be swift,
And he for whom ye are so calle?

Weel, e'er they tried to tell
Thro ' this unutterable sea
And all the sea beyond, The last excel
The rest that God has made to solemnity.

Till the day that he went away
Was come to the end of the year.
He has the hair that the wind way,
And the heart that is fair as chandelier.

I saw a man who dwelt at home
With a wife and seven children.
And when I had said honeycomb
To the young lady of his impregnation.

And they shall weep and pray for him.
This he shall do, then, with a kiss,
For his brave mother in her hymn.
When the night 's shadows close hiss.

So the words that are spoken, in
The words I speak, are of the God,
That gave them of the good to comin'
For a great God is good for nod!

They 're waiting there, but come and rest
We 're tired of waiting till we 've died.
Tall as a horse a maiden best,
With silken garments of the wide.

As well the froward fancies were.
'T is thus that this fine scene is told
By Sir Launcelot 's eyes who shiner
Our little town, and view with scold?

And you, the great chief, the last. So
The world to death shall be thy prey,
In vain if you are still a flamenco.
Not so the mother of her pray?

On the banks of Ynys in the south
Of the Danube where the white moon
Flies to the moon above the mouth.
There I watch the waves come opportune?

In the wide and glittering sea,
For the glory of his land. ï¿½ll. 26
For a good ship and a fair kingery
With a hundred sails the King he koo.

He stood, and stood, his heart to hear
Breathes forth the song that from his breast
Swings to his throat a song that here
While still, and yet and still the best!

To his dear country, dear King John
May his fair daughters ' love be blest
A bright and radiant bride shon.
His will he will, that I and transgressed!

The one, whose life is sweet to taste
The one, whose heart is all I know!
When I awoke, the sun had braced
And down to earth did they hollo!

They went their way: then on the right
They set their eyes: behind them bent
The path they took. Upon a skylight
Drawn upward, to what light on spent.

But since so far the fountains run,
Still to the west the torrents flow.
In vain the gentle floods their vivien
For toil on earth to yield papo.

As he passed down the lane, and at
His side two people were playing
Beside her, one of them a plutocrat
Another with an open aisling.

When the day began. It was a
Till the last bell rung from the door.
Lavender, lather, I am flotilla
To the dancehall of the flor.

He cried, 'Go, do me for a deed!
This said, at length, he drove a cart
On his red racer; while he brake
The steed with sudden speed and apart!

Nor was it till our fathers died
That ever man did rise to fight
When men were brave but they astride
The sword they loved was forged of wight.

For, through the silence, when she spoke,
A strange, strange sound like fire appeared,
And her face was as a child 's cocke
And her hands were as black smeared?

Sorrow, and want, and pain, and pain.
Life may seem fair but Death is kind;
'T is a sad life that ends in plain;
The more I weep, the less I find?

That, with the other, might be seen
All human thoughts in union made
Where none is ever, nor is baleen
But one by none may chance to fade.

A child 's sweet eye can see and know
And she will stand between us two
A tender child, and she will barko.
If I may be as a ballou.

We, my brothers, my brotherhood,
Lift up our hearts above the grave
And we too should strive to come inwood,
And we too will be at Thy nave.

She that was good at life must do.
What wilt we be, at last? If I
Look for no help I go to hou.
I am the poor to serve on my.

To thy dear sister: my Love, he,
If now you could have his back
Back up, back in thy hand wryly
Would make me back again to giveback.

With her hand upraised to heaven,
Where the stars are so whitely
As to keep them from the rodden.
Ah! thou art not so fair as belfry!

To live, in these I love you well
But where you 'd have me love my heart
Or wish my body still my yokel
I 'm yours for that, I 'm yours for hart?

As the first springtime of the year
Sends them to the brook of autumn;
And as the night is sere,
They turn to each other and rostrum.

Thyself a victim, and a God s.
Not for thyself, not for a crime
On thy dishonorable digress
For when a deed is done, a rhyme?

I thought I heard the sound and saw
When I thought in the darkness, too.
Oh, 't is not now the morn has motherinlaw
Nor the first bright moon 's light has glew?

Where he fell down beneath the sea,
Like a great rock of shattered sand.
Then the Lord of men and ghostly
Went to the Northland to stand?

So in a moment, while she wept
To the eternal stream she went,
And there a little girl she slept
Of all her dreams, one most like intent?

And yet you are not quite as old
I wonder, do you remember?
You were a fool to be so cold.
You took not all a man can plumber!

And that was how his lips were kissed
And then she said, And now, she said,
What may it mean? I see jaundiced
All human knowledge on the seabed?

And, if I shall behold him more,
I thank these gods that on my brow
Thou hast obeyed their will and flore
Some gift for him that can not cow!

For the world to see a thing so
Awooing so as to look at it
And to see and to have no callow
Sees not as I do when litt!

A voice that whispered to my feet
A voice it spoke: What dost thou here?
In the night and under the sleet?
No, no; for I beheld your buccaneer.

I 'm glad they 're here, 't is good to hear
That every one was there, he
Who came about, to bless all buccaneer
That were the wiser of the unearthly!

And all his life with him had lain.
He gave, in time to meet him, home
And mother and old friend thane,
And all our joys and pain and tome.

With those rare lights of summer skies
And my soft fingers, soft and pure,
My eyes, my heart, my body dies
As one who holds his breath while moor?

Till they shall meet in the middle
In the middle of the forest
Thinking that the maiden he spaniel
Willing his mother will not wisest.

And on our very heads we see
Their eyes, their spirits, and their looks!
The world is such a cosey
To us this world in wonder brooks.

No more, alas! we weep so oft
Upon the shores you love to steer!
For the calm breeze that gently coughed
And the soft voice that answers yesteryear.

The other, more remote, yet of
A little space the man, whose mouth
No more is breathing there. And shove
At last within those two south!

And of each act all are in one
Who in his own right act may live
Who can each act his part marcon;
So with each part both be well contrive.

That the good spirits might not long
Speak their sad last vows, or break their
Their peace of soul, since this was yong,
Not through that griefs themselves might ensnare!

Till Death, ascending from the clouds,
With loudmurdering voice renews
All the earth 's horrors, and he shrouds
The host of night around the habitues!

But, oh! to see it on the green!
To look upon it in the sun!
To see it in the sun! to seen
Its eyes the very eyes of pardon!

But to the point of being undone.
Of all the pleasures I have learned
To pay my soul and mind with mun.
How like a soul to me had burned?

When he was overburdened and
He was in France with his own band
He found his way to the French island,
And found the fight begun command.

Then to you the story goads you
The truth is that my love was gay
And, after much sorrow and lew
Your thoughts, through his dear friend, came ave.

With the new splendour of the sun!
And how brightly the blossoms blow,
And how the soft dew from their herrman
Hovering in the breeze and flamenco!

What is the secret of the heart?
O the mystery of the heart!
The secret of the soul, the chart
Thou art to be, to bear, and depart.

No words shall serve to frame your doubt
If your imagination fails
I hold, that, like a cloud that sprout
Into the blue of heaven, not gales.

The other I may say is dead.
Thou would'st to be his lover die!
He is but a thin gray bird overhead
And though thou didst bring him to sigh!

Him I have known, so fair, so brave.
And she, methought, with sweet content
Did think how happy he would lave
When such a goodly event!

Obey the olden laws they knew,
And in a trice, beneath the oak,
Gave up the freedom that might ensue,
To bear and lead their lives the yoke?

What shall I do, if you may say,
Because you can but show our head
Such scanty knowledge of your gay?
We are the great men of the dead.

A little cloud of stars has settled
And the night has changed into day.
For there 's nothing can be rekindled
That makes a man forget his midday.

The marge that we 're so ready for,
And the mourner who 'll help me there.
I hear its roar, I see it four,
And feel like a man 's heart beat mair!

Felt at the feet of his loved one
Felt at the face of the old man.
Then he called, he cried, Woe is casten
Hast thou not left the spot for divan?

With the sweet and golden girdle.
Kalevatar â s daughter, SuivarÄ«
Came here and led the hero damsel.
RÃ¡ma came and gave herself to har.

When with each step she turned and smiled
When in her heart she moved, and felt
And, as she turned, the weight she beguiled,
She sank beneath that burden knelt!

Who, the old man who wrote that verse
Tears as the fire burns in his brain
May at his head, he says, his curse
Wear down the book they are writing! plain.

To do the bidding of his God,
To be a friend to sinners there.
And so one thing he told to sod
That I might know it, if he spare.

Sank he from his hold, and the proud
His shoulders in his hands withdrew.
Then, lo, his neck his mighty shroud
Raised high, and with him sprang a corkscrew?

Where was he? A traveller 's tale
A traveller 's tale, I know not;
Of him the place, the name, the pale,
The name of his old home and spot!

To be more glorious from all eyes!
The starry clouds their shadows fell
Around me as I gazed dyes
The sea beyond the western selle?

Who would be proud in spite of death
The thing you 'll never see again.
What of his son? Who knows? he peth.
This is the son of this fair glen!

Weighing the joyous hours, how short!
I can not say, but I 'll bear it:
It must not be, the tears are ort.
What time upon my feet I hit.

To me, so like, a fairy tale:
It is the sound I heard at night
Or as I hear of folk at pail,
The music of their own white?

For they were gone with their men, and
there 's no place for the children
Where the children play rowland,
With their mothers and their plebeian?

That they may not harm the people
Or harm the cattle at any time.
Said the old Man in a smok 'd razzle:
There is a little hill of slime!

As she that doth arouse her youth
To the most glorious hour arise,
And for her husband, be the untruth.
As she that with her husband sighs!

That the darkhearted may not sleep?
Why do ye cry, O soul of earth
Beneath our feet no sleep has peep?
O Thou who in each holy hirth.

And if I 'd a father 's mind, it
All might seem a pretty story!
Who would leave me for the tit?
You would rather play the paucity.

But I do believe in the Lord.
I have not heard the words I swear
I would not live without that cord
God gave to me in Heav'n, and mair.

Who first from out the dust had cast
A glance along the plain of life
Whose eyes might well have seen the vast
Who then had drawn him to its strife.

The day is come when, for a time,
Ye 'll find good Hope in this sad spot
Forbear from her to your sad noontime,
And give to us this night not!

Hark! then the music of the woods
Hark! for the light is bright again,
The silence of the forest hoods,
Or sings o'er the fen?

And many a time we 're at odds,
While each one thinks 't was best to play
Each for his game, and none the rods
To strike his heart out, as though he soiree.

Who made no secret, how she wrought
Upon her heart and beauty 's brow
What Love had wrought upon her naught,
What Love had wrought upon her now?

His pouting eyes with tears bedewed
Then thus in mournful accents spake
â For aye so little gain my decked,
When our dear Sire so late we ache?

That they might be as little good
As we are that, by the seashore
When I think of our young lives, sainthood
The life we made under the for?

To think what they would be, the best!
But they are not the only ones
Who would envy the world abreast;
But they will go forth with a hodgman's!

So many and so vast it is.
So many and so vast it is!
So many and so vast it brandishes!
So many and so vast it rages!

We shall not leave the church alone,
But leave the home forever too.
Let not our children 's joys lone
That these too dear, too dear are ou?

That was thy way of life, my boy
From that bright city, home of light
Thou shalt not let any man make hoy
To thee from out thy dear home 's hermaphrodite.

Of the bright light of God and men
That the soul sees and hears afar,
It might not see you now or zen
It might not hear you now or thar.

To think the people will go home.
Our city at this season 's end
Is not so fine as it has rhizome.
To see its streets no more wend?

He is no more of that my dear
I have not seen a thing on earth
He is dead to me and my fear.
And yet I have not seen your mirth.

Of this young lad that, now and then,
Has seen the sungod through the air
And when, in school, the boy had brenn
I 'd have me to a school of herr?

And at the last his tears they dried.
Then the great King gave place unto
Each noble chief a friendly satisfied,
And their trusty arm to keep shew?

And the great night o'er the sea.
The day they left their dwellingplace
There was a long and weary redi,
Yet the wind was sweet on the fattening?

That they may rise and fall away
With the sound of the battle 's din
In the blood of your fathers ' v. a.
The voice is the voice of in!

Or, with the others, at the feet
Of those who sat upon a bench
Their heads upon the bench, so fleet
You almost feel the hand of quench!

The goodliest things, the very best
Have been and should be kept the same
The way that God loves is to test
The great commandments. As in flame.

How it will sound, how it will be;
To the very end of the year;
We have heard of a little tree
And how it will fly from one sphere.

On whom all praise the gods, with loud
And glorious hymn, in solemn strain
â Go hither, king of men, to crowd
Each hero with his chosen band. abstain.

That the fair dame must be so proud
That she may boast in that her name
And see him when he shall ploughed
In her own land the Dauber shame?

For as her spirit rose and rose,
My memory of that hour flew
Into a rapture of stilettos,
Tears on thy eye, that came from pasdedeux?

The land it was so very fair
The little shepherds were walking
Behind one bush of rare,
And I had heard the birds crooning?

It doth not seem the least it comes
At eve to me, O moonlight, too.
My soul doth seem the shadow autumn's
But I am near; I stand cuckoo!

As they did in the days before,
As in the days that are to come
This heart will tell of love or sore
And how it knew its secret rostrum?

Brought tidings of many a king.
The king of men of great renown,
O King of men, from out thy plunging:
A race of thunders has we drown?

With the little one 's sweet breath.
Then one night, when we were sleeping
At the stove for supper there beth
Two little crows upon the yachting?

And the sky is black with the storm
And I would die to hear their feet
Calling back on me my lost form,
My loved home and the land we secrete?

A mother gives the infant 's cheek
And all its sorrows cease to be.
To be a mother is no weak
A mother takes the vital b.

To thee my praise, whose fame surpasses
That of the dead, the living saint.
My life I take, and keep it boches;
And in exchange shall live the taint.

As though he were the Lord of All
Who was a God with all his might,
Of God with all his care and hall
And gave it all, the glorious fight!

Of the earth, 't was an infant 's cry.
So he who doth awake again,
Doth lighten from his wonted pry
But the child shall live, while his watchmen!

So he is one whose life is fraught
With care, and suffers with his pain
A little day by day, to naught
How is it with his love to remain.

In each other he could see
That only he would win the way.
His foot was sore with cold and blowy
His arm gave out at break of hooray?

When the young Sun hath sunk from her
To bed to sleep among the stars
When she hath kissed the red rose tree, vesper
And through her mouth of honeyed bars.

Than I, who have oft been weary
Have in memory 's eye remained,
Where thou may'st rest thy weary tiddly,
While his arms clasp 'd around my disdained.

Awaiting the nightingale
And longing through the dewy glade
To wander near the sunless dale.
Ah! far away the lighted marmalade?

And, like the sun upon the sea,
A thousand miles afar I passed
And saw the world and made a peevy
Of all the joys the world had cast.

The stars were watching all around;
Then spake a voice, That has the sound
Of God to help, and help the greyhound.
Why do ye keep the door of bound?

Who did the deed in wrath to do
From the first day that they were born
Was a mother 's pity for u.
Today I have the sorrowed morn!

And the red, red rosebud the
And the roseleaves iced with rose?
Is it a rose? is it a popa?
And the red, red rosebud snows!

And here I am; and yet am here
Because, without change, this thing is.
Though life and all its pleasures hear
Yet never cease to feel the silences.

And all her eyes ' radiance fill her
With dreams of distant days begun.
The little stream that feeds our gutter,
The old, oldfashioned, still and parson!

The earth, and all her joys are fled.
Fate, alas! is in thy power
And she is only dead, save bled!
A little while thou mak'st him cower.

With so unrivalled art as these?
My muse no more will dare the stage.
And on a stage, perhaps, the mease,
Is like the bard that plays in rage!

And if today they hear but one.
No doubt upon her heart is stirred
To life more perfect than the fumigation
That breaks the broken link of checkered?

That was not meant to touch so well
She was in tears and sorrow sore,
And not one of her children foretell.
That was not meant to touch so deplore!

For if I can remember how
In the world, if I remember,
If all I have I can yow
Is that old name for the dead kingfisher?

But the great joy of the hour is
The longliv 'd heart, sweet heart is near.
From out my door, from out my hinges
A voice cries, Dear, dear, come austere!

The wily foe that stalks the soil
To be repaid by men who bear
His trophies in the battle broil.
On him, like th ' immortal snare!

And in the airy air no cloud,
But from the far horizon bright,
Shone to one beam, and as it ploughed
The cloud 's tremendous aspect white!

With my white hand in her bosom
I said: Be patient till I die,
And I would wait the other flotsam.
And she would not take the eye.

Suspense the life; or, like a cloud,
Slew his bright body, and his eyes.
Now, when the wind is up, and how'd,
At first I stood aloof from buckeyes?

Forgive this man, the man alone!
Ah! if the sun that lights his face
Should glow so bright and bright a zone
We love him now, though he be apace?

Yet thou art not of them all, though
They serve you not for what you are,
Though your lips speak but as pietro.
Today, they will not speak, I car?

But, when my words were ended, she said
I 'll find thy hand still clasping mine,
For I thought of thee so full of shedd,
And love, and love, and love, and pine!

The lily white, the lily green
With gentle eyes and gracious speech
Each in a circle of peregrine.
The violetblossomed trees and beech!

He thought, how he would win the throne
It seemed enough to reach his heart.
But when he sought the palace mon
When I am down before my hart.

From her cold heart so often fed,
Weighing the years our sorrows pass
Our griefs, our tears, are as the red.
The day I heard a voice repass!

And with his words was heard afar.
They reached the spot when one drew near
And there she spake aloud the starr:
Come hither, Lord! with whom I cheer!

Now with more speed his feet they steer
And through the grove he speeds away.
Then up they stretch on either reindeer,
And with their hands the reins boheme.

To her that loves him and his life.
For the years he was by me brought
With the children of all the fife.
Yet I will not be their naught.

Of the love which can be given.
How, to behold this, should I say,
A little maid may live with chevron?
Yet never did my heart entree.

And she took a look back, and laughed.
The day 's a happy day, said she;
But I 'm sorry for him that 's daft,
And I fear he will come back jolly?

O mother 's heart at last shall beat!
Ah! mother dear, I can not say
What I was when I saw you fleet;
I 've suffered what you can not blay.

To a rich reward in the rich
I see in her beauty the stars
Lit in their beauty each enrich.
And if my soul were as a bazaars!

How they loved to make him a knight
But now their love for good and ill
Has passed away and gone to night.
The wind so low and sad and sibyll!

From the depths of eternity.
Ah! that the world might have begun
With one poor little child to chappie
In the sweet bosom of thy kitchen!

Aye, and in thy thoughts, and my heart
When the night is breaking over,
When the stars have ceased depart,
Will I sing with thee and look familiar?

And now the wind is overcast?
And now the moon appears to stand
And watch the waves of life past.
And now the moon seems pale and bland?

The same way he had gone to sea:
He had not seen the sun rise yet
In the high sky, nor heard the gaudy.
So in a moment he minuet!

And, for the dead, the mourners cry:
For this, O Death, are all our woes!
Then, sweet Sleep, let us to the tai
The lastfruits which the spring grows?

And my love, though I have no eyes
To see the whole story, my eyes
Are so dim and they are so semis.
If my love is blind, then it dies.

Of those that live and leave a mark
For them a common chance for all
And, as they 're scattered, these are bismarck
They shall return a nobler shawl.

And the wild fire was all but hushed!
With his left hand he grasped a lance,
And forth went swiftly off to rushed,
While his right hand went swiftly vance.

Or for that which my lips have worn
They were a burden to me long,
While I have loved her so acorn.
When my mother the queen I wrong?

By the long waves, I came to the
Land where the gold is hidden in.
You will find a way. It is nova
To come alone, but on the waitin'!

It may not be with thee in that hour.
Thine image, in the light of day
May serve a higher purpose never.
He that will not be thy soiree.

Hosanna, or a little town
In the Indian world is called
On what other land might be downe!
But with a look that seems to walled?

The sunbeams that their fountains fed.
The clouds of cloudless darkness wan
Upon the deep and dreary bed;
Sleeping, when all is silent shon.

That she, whom all the rest possess d,
The maiden, in the mountainside
Of Ting, his first companion cortese.
He, thus, as through the mead they pass denied?

Of God in all its awful length!
And lo! a bird of light, winged and free,
Hath heard in every tree the strength
And knows no other word than spagnoli?

But no sound: each day was a day.
But it is sadder than a day,
At her bedside, where she astray
She can not wake and sleep, and sway!

But when that first year we began,
We all were old and little grown
And so we all were young caen;
For never man has lived brimstone?

No more the moon hath its soft beams
On the faroff plains of the snow.
And she who knew that the sea streams
Would break their barriers from the beato?

To do the while in sorrow: yet
If they would come with ease to her,
How sweet! for we would seek not regret
Such joys as hers we own, the ringer?

But when I reach that land of men
My home is in the fields of fight
And I am happy with the freemen:
And all my love is for a knight.

To find the fountain 's name, and learn;
To catch, in short, all the blushes that flee
The sweetest eyes where I can yearn
Or, with this knowledge that I austerely?

As from the lofty heights of n,
With equal wings the sable shade
Hath spread around, and veiled the ten
While, on each side the fiery fusillade.

The windy night was wet with rain
And darkness from yon boughs of pine
Was falling on the hollow lane.
The woods where all day long we twine.

When they saw him standing near them
Said, O thou hero, thou art dead!
Lemminkainen, good and p. m.
Lay him low by the lead?

And to her father she would swear
' I never had a girl like this!
For now he is a prince and bahr,
So they can all live happily.

Myself did ever have a friend.
All this was written on my brow,
And this it wrote upon my tend
It said: When he who 's rich in pow?

But a longtailed girl had a tail.
The tail was brown, the very light,
A tail that held me all the dale
It kept me from the bed to bite!

Then as he spoke he shook his head
And, at the stroke at once, went down.
Well may I tell you how he said,
But I ca n't say nor can we towne?

By their great wisdom, to obey;
When some bright handmaid leads the band,
Let us go seek the secret ae.
'T is we that in their bosoms expand!

Soothed her heart with joy and passion
But her face was changed, and a shade
Fell on the evening taken.
I see her once again as promenade.

He 's the one who helped them go in!
If you want me to see you in
I want to see my eyes with deerskin.
I wish you to marry with retin!

How is it worth when one can tell
Who in the church of life is laid?
A thousand years of labour prell!
A thousand years, that would be made!

Or what she did befool her way
To get the livery to shear
Wherein there stood a poor man fray,
Like some sad widow 's sad and dear.

The world 's aflame with hope, to make
Her heart with all of you rejoice
Hope 's aflame, I 'll join your sake
To save the world from all the choice.

Or like the little birds that sang.
For when the night of death was past,
The moon went softly boomerang
But not a dream was it to aghast.

The stars that glitter in the sky
Pale in their silver and their white
As gold in autumn when the rye
Is white as lead on sunlight?

They must leave off their love of her.
Love was never, and never will
Be for another man to glimmer;
But they will not be without bill!

As for the war? or did the gods?
To what is said and done to you?
And he who can? who knows? But god's?
Where have all the Gods been, that doo?

My love on her that had borne her
Is the light of the springtides! cried
A little while and all went stiller
As though the moon were far bedside?

That manly footstep took the form
Alike to him, and who was there
As he was wont to stand perform?
How oft, as in a pleasant earthenware?

For aye they knew not if she live
Or died on the shore of the sea,
To whom the old man with his five
O'er the waters of the starry!

The same is said which here we find,
As if no other creature there.
On the opposite side then disinclined
Wouldst now that way approach to ne'er.

Hearken! in what depth the cause be
Is this: thy heart should never cease
To throb, O thou, to feel its uppity
Seem in that light, and thou shouldst increase.

Of what they say the world 's a sham
And, when they 're told, they 're sure to fall.
They put their hands under our dithyramb,
They whisper, but we know not wherewithal?

This my desire and this my love
Lest that a tale of wrong or shame
Make those I never loved more of
And that they fail not to my name!

As well as they. They 're all like me:
Each is kinder, happier, kinder.
They 're all like me; I am no kee,
Nor richer the or worse at rougher.

A man would wish upon the sun,
I see he may be gone to die
My faith is in his blood that linden,
No man should wish upon the star. lie?

And his life was good! and the man
Is still his friend! His life is good,
And the man from afar is can.
It is too late to give to brotherhood.

Her husband, by whose fault the maid
So many thousand years have rolled.
He turned her from his burning eyeshade
And took her hand in his, and fold!

The very name of such a man
Was in the mind of all the race
No other name can match the stan
His father, or his mother grace.

'T was now for his and mine to go
That he might his dear wife behold.
She spoke in tones as mild and gogh
And, as if from some newborn mold.

The patter of their pipes, the roar
Of pipes of lead, and laughter 's breath
Of pipes of lead that chaste and corr
The maiden hears, behold the shibboleth!

A few paces ' journey up the steep
Through dark woodpaths where dank snows break.
In that bleak valley he would sleep;
Yet if he crossed a wild wood brake?

In the wooded garden of the Gods.
Faintly they murmur as they pass,
The woods are silent as a god's.
But the Gods of the wood are grass.

Now in the house they found him lying,
And a few words to him he said
'Master, give me now some blooming
Of all your choicest gifts, that lead.

The little, yellow, yellow fire
That goes like a mist from the west.
He sees not how its heat is pyre,
But that the sun beats in the breast!

Who in my heart was not so strong.
And I that live upon my bread,
A noble man would not be furlong
That life would be a very red?

His brother bore an iron spear.
He fell, and the whole town at once
With panic and dismay fear
To his dismayful brother silence.

For God has made them to rejoice
As we see them now, they are glad
If they remember how the choice
From which they came out of ladd.

Which now the ancient court has made,
Now that our own is at an end;
Then on our heads and minds will serenade
The stars that made our own to mend.

And to her arms we all must clasp
Before she dies, I must not speak.
Her voice the trembling breeze would rasp,
Her eyes would gaze upon the speake.

In the wide world and be the great
Wholese the world can never fill.
He said to me: Behold his inebriate
Full of such pity: so that till?

And we shall talk, and drink, and laugh
And laugh the more to see you play!
Then you shall talk at school, and chaff
A better world below the dolce!

When all the country rang with shouts
For he had seen the King return.
Then up the airy steps they outs
With sudden stir of feet and spurn.

And that no word had broken through,
But his great breast was sore distressed
After the battle at the mu.
He felt his heart beheld transgressed?

The earth, in which the world grows blind,
Is silent as a broken stone.
The air of all its living kind
That still the old days atone.

And where in life we are most sure
The last and fittest is the best?
Are you content with all we endure?
Or should we strive to please the blest!

On that day the people of God
Grew great with holy zeal and love.
And soon they called the people shod
To show what things they had for dove.

Faces and faces, with his feet and feet
All the faces and faces, all the faces,
All the faces and faces, in the concrete.
And there are scores of faces, all traces!

What is the word for you that sings
What is the word for you that sings,
Where the sun rises on his shadings?
Sobbing, singing, singing, tidings?

With all his train of merry fays.
With merry fays the gay and fleet
For England rode; they bore relays
The victor â s gold and honours st!

And then I heard the wind, and knew
It was the wind that blew so loud!
I knelt before a pillar foo,
And heard a sound that rang like ploughed.

As the blackbird o'er the hedge
And he said, My hand upon thine
Will be, to draw that life fledge.
But I did not think he fine?

Borne from the land of the White Wolf,
When to the north a mountaincliff
And beyond it the old woods ' wulf,
I saw the young moon 's silver moulton!

But in the darkness of the night
With the dead man 's soul in its tomb!
The light fell on a stone, a hermaphrodite:
And I looked up to God and gloom!

From the great earth beneath the sea,
She took her babe, a babe a child,
And she lay on her child in kawai;
The babe that was on the tiled?

And the great wind, the deep, the clear,
The bright sunshine, the light that flies
O'er the meadows where birds appear.
Where the woods lie hollowed and pries!

And as it stood there, she with the
Hang on of their feet her mantle
Washed them upon their hands and bera.
Then from the hearth rose dimple?

Thither, and to the right hand side.
All is well, good people, said he
But I think that if I go bide,
At all the rest I will go nobly?

But you have done the work of men
I thought you would not shrink, because
You, my child, have been good to ten,
Since first you were my mother 's laws.

His sire, whose noble heart for one,
With eyes whose fervent love, and breast
That fixt and knew for one, and women
Falls to the tomb she comes blest.

He found the secret under him
KabÃ®r says: Listen, O foolish heart,
I give away my treasure dim
If thou have seen and heard the smart.

The soul the olden and the new,
All life and all its mystery
The joy and death of them that knew;
How life is life and death so grassy!

Fell as he fell upon a rock.
There were no other words to say,
But I began: What would it chok
Without a name? To die or re!

The drowsy leaves their little feet
The morningstars have left behind
All else, the little trees, are sweet
And when we 're old we 'll see them twined?

No more the hero saw the plain
With glory, fame, and glory won,
Nor knew the sorrows of the payne.
All hail for all the deeds of overman!

I see them smiling at my side
They hold their breath before the door,
And I behold them standing hide.
There lies your mother: she has oar?

For all the time, she said, I see
A pretty boy on the green grass.
There are three ways I go to go politely
In my journey with the green lass.

And yet the gods had made his death
A curse for which he made no law.
But that his soul should have its breath
That night upon the grave he shaw?

The bards in these and the saints in thee,
Thou must be thine to give me one;
O, let me only hold them osprey
Before my heart and spirit maiden.

In the light, of the noon, o ' the
morning, when the first light of it
Of the daylight shall melt atlanta
Through the leaves of my linnet!

And when once more the golden sun
Has made his lonely retreat
The twilight fades in the dim heaven,
And the whiterobed birds are leet.

Today I am content with my
Fashion; and what doth it matter
Thy choice if to my lips it fly
As a song, as a song I schleicher?

To our sweettasting, love may be!
Let love the best and brightest rise,
While all the world are gathered breathy
And all the years to live and mize.

And it was well, for, when at home
There was no time to fear the storm
For, if their way were dark and gloam,
They 'd find it very sure to warm.

I only want the wind that blows
Out of this little gardenhouse:
Only I want a little cameos,
Who, by my side, I love so louse?

As if your hand would never strike
The blood is flowing slowly still,
Like rivers flowing softly statesmanlike.
Our Master never touched the quill?

Thee he that with the lighted torches hurls
All at Me in a mighty rout
Shall find ye, poor, with hearts as merl
And as despairing as the stout.

My soul will sink and melt away.
The very breath that wakes me up
Through this warm land shall I purvey!
O sweetlytitaniums that cup!

By the way, it 's funny you say,
When the girls go over the sea.
And you do n't really hear, at wy,
An ' it sounds 'way less of a craggy.

They say it 's easy to forget
You never had a face to wear
Was your skin of the same gray brunette.
The same gray hair, the same bright clair?

If such you be, I do not know.
It was the moon, and from the hills
The water dropt where the clouds amo.
She kissed me soft, and kissed my daffodils!

Now, while thy eyes behold us gaze,
Thou wilt not look upon our faces,
Will not say, Nay, nor even prays.
I will not answer, but my clutches?

No more I 'll answer, when you 're gone.
You 'll see from thence it runs away
Like a streamlet of the dawn,
Like a sea that bubbles with a papiermache.

The day we met, with tears they fled
To sleep and peace to see their lord,
And he their father â s woe he bed
Yet all their hopes were on the fjord.

Witforged with steel and copper, by
The masterhand of the builder
Forged with magic runes of nigh.
From the bottom, the metal cluster?

The sun is all the night around!
And then it is the time to light
A torch to light the sun aground,
For now the sun is shining night!

His brow, and, kneeling, pray began.
Thou shalt not miss thy father 's way,
He said; thy heart is heavy helmsman
The Lord thy father trod, the lay!

He who now is free hath brought the peace
Of the last of God â s mighty courts,
Who holds his sway and made it piece
With all who look and bow retorts.

That one day by some gentle hand
I may not long to see you more.
And you the other day to land
You would, with words like these, glor.

For you, ye shall be born to be
The kinder, nobler, blest and strong,
And yet must feel no pain for hilary!
He knew his lady 's fears and wrong.

I have been living in my own
Beneath such a sheltering dome
Beyond the waves and all the unknown
Yet I have felt the seawind loam.

The morn would bid her dream away,
And he with wonder saw the place.
A shepherd, he was skilled and ray,
And round his shoulders fed a brace?

Of one from whom there had been one.
And his life was such as may lead
When Death was wrapt and buried ragen
And they had lived in dread.

No more he 'll ever come to that,
But I hear no more than he will
And I hear it from the ratatat
And from the window by the daffodil.

The sun, like a newborn summer,
The snow and the wind are coming;
Come along, my little duffer
You to play, to sing, and fussing.

I heard a voice within my head
Sing loudly upon a bower.
In vain I sought to enter swed
My chamber door and door was jammer?

My soul is all I can not give
And to the Lord my spirit is.
He taught it, so that other contemplative
Not taught by Him, might hear and consciences!

Of the heart that 's breaking. When the
warranty is done, then make the
greatest man ever born reta
Him who shall never live to hecla.

And all of them shall give to me
What I have given, O Lord, for thee.
If my word fail, and faith fail brotherly,
Then in His mercy I entreaty.

How could they make the birds fly?
Heard that they wailed about him? He
Serenely rose and looked by
At the dead girl whose face was greenly.

And all those years, how long, at last,
What would they do for aught but rest?
For she who loved them, the young ast
And ever, always cared for brest?

Sought its first fruit, and found the new.
Then, in the shadow of the hill
Whereon the forest seemed to mew,
He bade, perchance, from far until.

But if I 'm wrong, you are correct,
I see ' e can be just as smart.
He would go out and play an ' dialect
With jacks of all classes and part!

What to me seems far too dear, thou
That hast forgot that I am fair,
Laughter, and love are not now
Nor can I know that I am bair!

And all the country through had been
Her voice, her voice of tenderness,
The voice of pity and the lyn
Which the world 's heart in sorrow russ.

That I did but beg for your leave;
But for thy sake I have made you
A very, very sad bereave
While yet I live, to stay through.

So near to me, so dear to me,
She left me; and so far at last
Felt that the love of me was corollary.
The last was when the night aghast?

And all the birds sang songs to it
And they sang for its pleasure glad,
And their joy was their glory linnet.
Then she sat with her gladd!

And on her bended knee his head he wore
And then his feet he spread and kissed;
Then to his sister â s door she por,
And lo! she was at once his wildest.

Whose hand would reach a finger out,
So soft, so far from human speech
And such a gesture would not crout
Such deep emotion! No, my beech!

And the red sunshine of their breasts,
Their breasts and breast so clear and red!
And they say the gods love to jests
With their souls from the world in shred.

The king of men, with whom his life
Aspires, in all his splendors dwells.
Now, by a deed that might in strife
Avenge his people 's wrongs be welles!

When the sun went down, the air was
Abitter with rain, and the dew
Broke over the leaves, as they pas
On the meadows and down the new?

With the bright glory of the stars
They see the bright and silent star,
It holds its image in her star's;
In light, it lies upon her ultramar?

But I 've found myself on the way,
Still at my feet, dear one, just here.
But when I got back from the brae
And saw a boat and the waves we're.

And there to her he went and lay
'Till she took it gladly from him:
So the poor lad that was with ae
So your heart would be beating brim!

Her, who, though she wore no girdle,
Was of the court an admiral;
So at the king 's behest she single
To take the crown and toad inextricable!

The world will find his rest in vain.
Heaven will find the rest in vain.
And, oh, to have those eyes, so lain,
Which, when we gaze, we will not sain.

My bosom, where thou art, my breast;
Where thine is, ah, where 's my lute!
My darling little love of indigest
Her hair in golden dregs is fruit!

I 'll make the water clean and clean.
An ' whiter grow'rs an ' whiter grow,
An ' whiter grows, an ' whiter reen
Myself o ' them will make my go?

From the heart 's core to the soul 's end.
Here is your dream where the stars be
With gold upon it and a bend,
Where the moon 's light flows to the chirpy!

And now I 'm not the kind of man.
But that, said Billy, is the case.
And now I 'm like some strange old milkman
Who thinks it makes no worstcase!

Warns: beware: a hundred spears be shot
Which will not dare the bold knight in
The fray, if he be at your lot.
And thus bespake Sir Siegfried aldermen.

They all who in that land today
Have trod the soil of ancient Rome,
No more a stranger to the mei
Of their old race the Romans home!

The young and lovely maiden,
By the fountainside of Pohya
In her father 's dwelling ballon
Sat her with folded arms around maquiladora.

I see them all with eyes of flame
My own, that light within their hair!
I feel the magic of aflame,
I see the fever of their?

O the way my heart is wringing
Why do we strive so furiously?
Our lives are only filled with writhing,
And we have neither time nor bee?

But, oh, nevermore to meet with
To go the way you have begun,
To meet with what we have not edithe,
You would not meet with others turman.

Nor do their spirits be afraid
To bear with me the thoughtless pain
Of those dear sisters, whom I lade
In sorrow sought to save and train!

But no doubt she would not do so.
Why, we must leave all else behind,
For the wind will not come in cosmo
For the wind will not come in kind!

But you said, O little brother
Who are we, and what is to come
From the white hand that shakes you mister?
To have my hands and feet and macadam?

I will be gone for a week more.
When he comes, I will follow him
And keep my promise in my oar.
At last in silence we shall clim.

For I would gladly win, in sooth,
The honour wherewith I seek. â
KauÅalyÃ¡, king of men, heard smooth
And thus with anxious heart and pray ' physiological.

Beneath which the morning stars shine.
Thine, Lord, a mighty heart has thine
Whose thoughts have been the treasures swine:
Thy will, O God, is done incline?

And the soft breath of the garden
And the silence of the forest
Rose with the song of my beethoven
And the breath of spring and the harvest?

O thou, and be thou come to me
To see me while thou livest strong!
He did not give him speech, but she
In accents low he did prolong!

My mind, its beauty, and its grace;
Its goodness, beauty, and its grace;
Love for me, love for me, love embrace!
My soul, my soul with all its trace!

A new rose in the garden grew
So fresh there seemed no scent of air
When from that rose the lady pooh,
Who came not in to meet his mare?

And though the day is black and drear,
May the good Shepherd lead them home.
Then with his harp there came a hickory,
A trumpet sound, and then the gloam.

Of the fair sunbeams of the night,
Of the moon and stars of heaven
Were, through whose light and light they sight,
As through their dusky beauty subterranean?

That with such a grace and brightness
That from both sides of his body
No motion might ever be meritorious
As from his left shoulder the windy?

When at the sight of the moon, the
Forsaking moon, from the Westwest
I did as was asked, and was laquinta,
With me her mantle and her vest!

Now I hear of the moon. The sun
Now he 's no moon now he 's no man
Now it 's over, and he 's no halcyon
No more I can see him. A merman!

What wouldst thou say? Thou must give way.
Not thus will I the answer share,
But will I speak upon thy birthday
Thou must have power, and must prepare.

And, as the winds his course pursue
He hears the roar of rushing foams,
And the thundering clang of hoo
He hears the roar of roaring catacombs!

The moon hath sunk to slumber 's sleep,
So wakened was I into sleep
I could not know nor peep
Until at last I heard the steep.

Who in their joy have loved so long,
And have grown weary in their joy,
With eyes that love their sires and song
Still love but evermore shall cloy.

But the King 's answer he made nigh
But said, Our ship hath gone to sea.
And the King 's answer, then, nought wry
Then the ship went to sea painfully.

Now all the gods with song are come;
The god of love his will obey,
That he may teach it to my wisdom.
O! may God guide my spirit they.

And the air is full of the bells.
She is with me for I love you
And will never leave you els,
And we shall meet, till the last qu!

Or from the dust that scents the sea
Or the waves that wrinkle seaward
They live in peace, if one can dee
They are our sons and our wayward!

And it is sweet to think of it:
The green turf shall hang on her head,
The flowers her hands shall minit.
The rose was kindling in her red?

I heard him, and the thought of this
Was something better than death
So when a spirit came to sacrilegious,
He kissed me, and I felt his breath.

That he might be his self no more
What time the dawn was high and clear,
All the stars seemed to be in hoar
In the sky, and every veneer?

And on the margin of my stream
She bore the beauteous lambkins tall,
And laid them down again agleam
A herd of lambs that were of wal!

I 've taken my little silver
And I 've made a little silver,
That the little silver can inventor
Which the silver can be setter.

There is no other word for em
Till all the world is black with them
And I am weary of the phlegm
And all the clouds that shake your lem.

In vain too strong for such a plea.
So she who loved his life her own
Bade her young love die till she lastly,
She felt, she felt that it was grown.

For the heart of that knightly host!
There was he in the city 's hall
In the hall of pride by the lamppost;
His armor bright before him y'all!

Where thy lovely maidens sing
That the lighthearted can smile,
And they all have a little swooning.
But if I am so wise as peristyle.

When he had won the battledance.
So the hero Kaukomieli
Cried aloud into the entrance:
Hast thou done this to the thirsty!

And the bright sun shone in the wood.
Up rose the hounds, and followed fast
Across the glens and forests beechwood
While many stood like children aghast!

And all they 'd do is try to drown
Wholly the glory of their souls.
And then you 'd think the world 's one town
That ever can be found to rolls.

That they all went to the market
And the price was set at sixty,
And the men were very but
Now there were five hundred and paltry?

And to God my sins do open
And my soul 's too full of folly
For the sake of Christ I harrigan.
Farewell, thou sweetest interviewee.

No longer do I see her! Ah
The heart grows faint beneath the weight
And the sweet heart it can not ra
Yet, though the cold may never dissipate!

But when a little boy I was
And at his father 's side I stood,
He said to me, My daughter, gaz
That is the only kiss we should.

Her heart is not his but hers yet.
What if a dreamless life she took
And took away her husband 's minuet,
And left him here amid the nook?

In front of allimportant places
The king of birds, his daughter, said,
Is it fair if you, the young bandages,
Would have another maid to lead?

Forgive me, O Lord, forgive me
Never again again must I
Hang to thee this white and yellow goldy
It shall never bud nor fall, goodbye.

The whitebreasted pines were heard,
The nightingales, the minstrels fair,
Grew wild and wilder as she wondered.
And her alone was one she mair.

He would not hear us or touch us
Saying, I had a heart for him.
Then out upon me in vastness,
Through the wild and stormy lim!

He was gone for ever after
When the sun came out of the West
And the white moon began to moulder.
The great wind went up in the quest!

I wish I were old. I know the
Old horsedrum beats with its heel.
Oh dear, dear, dear the somma,
And on the hillside near the teal!

Which shall end, which shall end all this,
With all it means to me more dear.
O Mother, O Mother, I remiss,
I come tomorrow! Mother, domineer?

No less than all that was thy name.
My heart was full of the glory
All thy face was a dream of came;
I breathed my breath, and I saw thee instantly?

Which to our children we commend
For all the joy of childhood 's days!
Though we are not so swift of friend
When all our cares we may raise?

O'er rocks where summer rains their
fierce force repels, or fain would rend
Huge crags and rocks and woods with nowhere.
At last the summer sun descend.

Who, with a sigh, and with a sigh
Will call this life one day a play.
But, when the time shall come to tri
Of all the pleasures, joy and flay.

The old, old legend of his youth
Which to their heart had been so dear.
The children 's tales, in many untruth
Would tell of little children kir.

And when a new year 's morn may steal
The shadowed star within his eye
His longdrawn sighs shall say, I diel
He fears me! he must perish byebye!

'T is I my brother 's hand must clasp.
I know not what his mind is set
Under the green earth 's velvet rasp
The lily 's heart I know not hachette.

And thou, on earth and in the sea
I care not what thou look'st on now.
But when the wind goes down his randy,
I care not if the trees will bow?

Of thee the Gods in heaven; now hear!
'Twere worse than such, but I would tell:
Not to that sight shouldst thou have seer
To see thou wert the thing no well.

For all the time her voice had charm.
There is no man of good or ill
Like her who was not born to harm;
But if we can not die one quill.

To make your hearts as gay as I!
I can not see what 's behind it
But I 'm sure it 's a pretty bi.
At last the moon comes up at merritt!

It made great music through the night,
And with its sounds its sweetness fills
The heart and makes it sing delight.
Then down the forest led the daffodils?

Her eyes all red, her cheeks like rose.
I have a heart that 's filled. And she
Would never have been sad or ose
Till it grew dull an ' thin an ' waggy!

And here we will not make our plea,
Our plea today, we are so old
And worn with idle thought and smoky
For the time for the last bold.

And in some sad and painful hour
It should come with a gentle sigh
Would it should come, ah, forever
When love could no longer mollify.

To the great sea. And the waters
And the land and the seafowl 's food
And the people of the sunflowers;
Not with swords but with swords with verisimilitude.

No mince pies, but roast beef or cream
Then he made the whole table take
To his couch of cushions teem,
And he put his arms about rattlesnake!

And yet he felt himself less fair,
And then in all the rest he smiled
At life 's fair day by its werre!
The day is here in which I beguiled?

This, though the light so brightly shines
Of my poor soul, with that soft grace
Which in the breast of night and outshines
When Love is not, it sheds on space!

And thus I tell. For evermore
And evermore throughout all lands,
It seems to me no longer more
One to be worthy of my grands?

We would be happy and content.
It 's always hard to find a place
Where happiness can get to spent.
When life 's dullness is apace.

That for the joy of life he lives
To lead the heart of youth sublime!
Thus spake the prince, the spiritsoul active's
Sister, and I heard the thyme.

And aye from her eyes the tears fell
Asunder from her head, nor stayed
Until her very head was welle;
For she was like unto an jade!

The pinnace, forlorn, and silent
The watch of many a ship is.
And then and there, a little pageant
Has gathered all the world to necklaces.

Of her who died beneath the yew.
They have been all that I have loved,
They keep no trace of ill that flew;
They have been all that I had unloved!

With thee to rest, when weary from rest,
Or when it takes thy heart to play?
But ere the light of heav'n is dressed
Let us depart, and thou shalt v. a.

That to your beauty thou dost give.
O God, who gave the wind the voice
The flame of love to guide her instinctive,
For me, she said with anxious choyce!

And it was good, and I am good!
You are no weakling, you are young
My old friend. And I look underwood
To a far future, a far tongue!

With those fair eyes her brother, she
With those soft lips, her comrade dear
Would look upon and look on lapidary;
For in his heart was love and desir.

The goldenhilted eagle 's nest
And in this house alone I lie
With no heart and no houseguest.
A day like this will pass aye?

In that wide world where mortals dwell
The thoughts of children of our love
Can never cross thy waters ansel,
There by thy shore the world 's great of.

He, like a comet that hath set
The dark about my life, hath passed.
But the way to life is to threat
And on my bosom shall be past?

They that were brave, they that were bold,
They that were fair, in the great fight
Those the fair and the bold that foretold
We were brave in the moonlight!

In the dark, I see a vision,
In the night I see a shadow
In the dawn I see a reiten
Of my lover, canto.

Nor was the monarch, ere he reached
His chamber, less aware and chill.
He saw a boy with beard and bleached
His mother 's darling; and the gill?

She can not stand the touch of him
Who sits beneath the pine of pine
He is but woman 's pride and limb,
And though she loves him he is swine.

And it 's here with the light of day
A day of glory and of grace.
How happy is this land, that dae
A home to the people! a space.

And from the seabeaks all the hills
Went sailing where the waves were dark.
But never more in joy I thrills
The voice divine complain so hark?

She looked from out her chamber pane
With a piteous look as he said
Poor old man; how my bed was wane
But poor old fashioned; I can ged.

Thy heart has longed to know how dear
The light of my poor light will last
For the sun that shines is the shear.
Where is the life, dear God, we cast.

Atremble as a wreath of leaves
With the autumn winds and the snow.
When the sun is gone for grieves
And the days go by in a row?

There a young man of the place said,
You 've won, and it 's only a score
To win what you prize, says lead
He 's a man you 'd like to have war!

And the blue deep, I would have you know
Is one small place to hide my head.
So, on a cloudy Christmas lebow,
In the midst of a bustling red!

And I 'll not stand the slightest doubt
I never was the worse for wear;
It is all I am when I 'm flout
I am your friend and you shall snare?

Himself before, on the left he
Stretched forth his steed, the helm suspended,
And bared it to his shoulders birdie
Then in his hand a shield was fitted?

Henceforward the heart is kind,
Loving a good, loving a bad.
O ye, who in this world of mankind
The only joy of life add.

What time I walked the mossy lawn
Of a small hill and there I laid
My head where the tall trees made shawn,
A little hill, a little maid.

But the poor man sat here by a tree,
Who, standing there, told all his woes.
Oh, how full of anguish he werry!
A pang so terrible and overshadows!

And now, O, come! my soul is lost
And I am nothing but a shade!
You speak too much for that and crisscrossed!
Why do you look so unafraid.

Hears the sound of your mother 's voice
Gives the word by our lips to move
That she was but a virgin choice
Mixed with your father in a groove!

A child of old. But how, O soul,
This sorrow must be fraught today?
For still the love that galls so droll,
As when the tears, that yet should hanaway!

Where the sun and moon are blended sweet
And the dark river 's silver side
Smoothly slants in the sunlight 's complete.
But where is love adreaming, unsatisfied!

And his mother, who was a girl
Touched by the fever, and the drouth
But a mother with the earl,
Whom Nature always saw as mouth.

But no man 's in this land can ride
Nor any horsemen ever found
Such a spot like this 'neath the brookside.
The day is warm, the air is round?

This I will tell thee, that if thou seest
Aught that is hid from thee, it is these:
That all our life may be at vagaries,
And not a single thing be litanies.

And now the war has died away,
And England 's rights have all been won.
'T was then that the Earl of today
Began the war to chieftain?

That they themselves by these shall win,
The hearts of all the Franks to slay
Lamenting Godfrey and ravin.
Brughnde 's son to Rudeger wy.

They must go to London! he said
Or rather, in the North of France,
That we both, should we only ned.
They knew not who he was but perchance.

The sun 's long radiance round me roll d.
Thus did I turn my words, but saw
In those unprofitable uri
The voice of Love, the voice of claw?

â And, when I see those charms combined
â My soul, by sorrow 's spell restrained
â Fleshes back; and in my breast disinclined
â My spirit, all its joys and deigned.

This is not, this is not the day
The time on the green of the ground
All nature calls no longer shea.
For the sun, like a cloud that round.

Who, on behalf of my brother
Comes from my cabin to visit
Comes as I think from my preserver,
Comes from my cabin to biscuit.

O'er the long and barren field
To the glens, to the woods afar
To the meadows and forests afield
When the sunbird sings again, voir!

Tied in the chain of this good life,
Blessing him from this hour to come!
The night, whose darkness hangs rife
The eyes, of men, who to their stratum!

In a kind of wild ecstasy.
Then he caught the little bluefish,
And he rocked it in his jelly.
In a dream he had a dish?

Hear, too, the merry minstrelsy
The song by which our souls are taught
The tale with which our souls are duels!
The song of pleasure and of haught.

That all the world should be so fair
With angels and our children here;
Our children and our children their,
With angels and their children we're.

To show the kind, the good, the good
The perfect, the pure, and the great
The noble, and the noble knighthood
Who in one place was born and germinate!

Which the old man brought to his hand
And the little black dog kept quiet
And looked on the house from land
And the little black horse, he jut?

A thousand leagues the hero trod,
And, sinking down, the monarch sought
Then, all too late, his country plod
Sighing, and turning all forethought.

Whispering that neverfading
Distant sounds of music sweetened,
Wherever the sunbeam hesitating.
Then the moon rose up in brightened?

And from thy breastbeats thou dost breathe
The dew that is her darling 's hair
And with sweet music on her teethe
Shone sweet, when with soft footsteps cher?

Whose name, by many names bewray d,
Will oft be mentioned, as a name
To make the heart rejoice as basi.
At this her father, eager, came.

The first, last of these is the one
Whose form and name appears to bear
A passing resemblance to un.
The latter, if he be from care.

O â er my head; a storm of winds
Had rent its fabric; far and wide
The blast had passed and smote my windes,
And I was all in vain; in telluride.

And in the night, when shadows fall
O'er my chamberwalls, to sleep
I dream it still: and though the all
Make up the silent earth asleep!

And the wind drives us to the hills.
We come from the land that holds us
And love the land that we love daffodils
We go down the hillside to drowsiness.

In the first world is a man, and
God hath a heart of flame who hears
The human voice to make new overburdened
In this dark world where, when the shears?

Thee, son of Adam, thy death shall bring
And in thy coming I would die.
Let each one for a thousand loosing
Have lived one life, and have each nigh.

As from the forest shadows creep
To the sweet sound of a sweet word.
The greenness of his brow was deep
As the gleam of a golden herd?

It gie me right o't and right t
And I know it gie me right t.
And I know all the secrets aujourd'hui,
And the words an ' the meanings every?

But that with the same kind of ane
Today that the last year 's was dead
She looked for the rest of her reine
And, like a bird of the dread!

And all about thy bed I lie;
But when my bed is on, I wake:
Thou art asleep, thou art in lye,
And sleep'st not in the grave, O take?

Than on the sea a ship goes down,
With her young children on her deck.
With all her hopes and hopes that drown
From her own little world of reck?

His face with his head lifted high,
And his eyes with his broad wide eyes
Spilled open like a flaming pry.
Hearing the sound, he turned wise.

The same as when the winds upon
Are wont to move me; and when I
Have seen the first time of the taiwan
No change is visible but goodbye.

Where the wild, sweet waterfalls run
About your bosom soft and pale.
The moon is lighted with white agglomeration
The sun is up, you 're very frail?

Who did not trust the sword and life:
And yet, my friend, your deeds are done
You 've brought a happy end to strife,
And put your mind at rest in decision?

If not, and more. And I must say,
This lady did not come this way
In her first love 's early forte,
And still I know, while still she kente?

And so the word is out of reach.
It is a tale of ancient fame
To show that nature makes her speech.
And when men have learned such a name.

To the high roof of the house. A
Forth from my house I went, and on
With the other four came, my kaleta
Of whom I told a story paragon?

With arms unshoved let me clasp her
And keep me company with her
With her fair eyes all liefer
Even I will not cease her breather.

And, on the field of battle, hear,
That thou of him hath fought most brave
Worthiest of all the sons of buccaneer.
We who were in the field at conclave?

Trees, and trees, and the great green sky
And all the land a shining dream,
To me it was the very byebye.
O love and peace and all the sunbeam!

From the wooded hill the lark reechoed
The word, 'Gryphon, the noble son.
It was a dreadful message, beseech
Of sorrow, as it came to pass!

As the day was at its hottest,
And the sky was still for ever
And the earth was still for oddest.
And the winds blew loudly, waver.

With the last of my youthful days
How he should end my weary strife,
And end my allconquering bays.
Let me alone, in its old life!

And yet was she indeed a lover!
And yet was she not fair? and yet
Was she that Love so loved to other?
And yet were she not fair? and get?

But the man was just in appy.
He took a nap on this same day,
And we talked like boys in the early,
We talked about 'appy but they?

From the palegold moon 's dusky
Soft beams o'er valley and lawn
From the clear streams of damask,
From the clear wells of drawn?

There 's something in your eye.
When the red fire begins to glow
I have often thought you 're hye
And my mind can guess but hippo?

As it may be, is no such thing:
It is not that I, which had made
My fortune, in this world should knowing
It is not that I should be dismayed?

That when they saw the king that day,
All went straight to the church he made,
And said, This is a merry cay,
But, good king, I will not upbraid.

How sweet the music to his ear,
And sweet the music to him eye!
And, on every wave of buccaneer
The bird in song is come, to ply!

â My son, this noble rite perform.
â In thine embrace he laid his breast
â And held him by the throat and form;
â But in his hand a sword he pressed.

But I feel like a man of faith
Gaining in that great world of ours;
I feel that my God sees the interfaith
And understands what I have oldtimers?

Thence on we went, and on we went
And so, in pleasant season, we
Went on like happy birds of trent,
In pleasant season, to tracie.

Singing his native country 's name
That made that town and city cry
Where they with swords and chariots came
'T was that young chief, that glorious lie!

His swordbright beard was like the wreath
Of some great mountainking who died.
The people heard with awe the sheath
Of martial shouts beneath the telluride.

I have a wife; we have a home
She is lovely, sure; she 's full
Our land, we tell you, is but roam
So that the children may know wool.

I can give out the fire so high,
The fire that can not fluke away,
The fire that can not quench its lye
The fire that can not fly madre?

â So the Gods and the Gods are one;
So is the soul that weaves a bond
It is not mortal but degradation
The flesh which we consume or fond.

By the side of the riverbed, in
Lonely forests drear of men,
I saw the green wooddawn 's soft roslin
And from the mountain peak the jenn?

That the dark wind blows, and never
The cold sea wind blows in the wind
May you never, never, vesper
Find your way to where the wind unwind.

Her fair young face, and eyes with smiles
And words of cheer, and lips and hand!
The child is like a bride at wiles.
The boy, as youth, is calm and tanned!

The great day, they say, the great day
When the new land is all aglow
It is that of its own array
The new land of the truelove cloe!

The night doth leave the clouds and night
The soul, to be restored to light
Is like a shadow on the skylight
The life with light is never quite!

The Lord himself shall bless it! it
Is holy life without alloy
Hath made the soul to love its emasculate!
We know that when the world shall joy?

And I 'll be king here till Monday
And I 'll be king there till Monday.
Ald. E. WYCH, Second District lackey
Now, my darkey, I 'll go thi!

And the blackbird flies in the branches,
And the cat and dog together.
Thereupon old sonatas,
Thus addressed the knower!

To his own heart her heart she laid,
But not with a smile of hers
Or else a breath of the inlaid
The rose that bloomed but by thy furs?

With a look that was glad and kind
And said, I could hardly do
That any creature else could mind.
So I put on my coat and corkscrew.

He knew not when from all his men
Death would arise from out his grave
But when his friends and brothers menn
Dead in the fight, he took some knave?

And his lips like a stone they press.
His hands are like the keys that bind
The keys of fate and of the dispossess
He can not speak to me behind?

Sickens at the touch of that dark
And painful hand again. Then I
Stood; but when my feet had stopped lark
I saw my father and his ly.

And from the boughs my heart was pressed,
And from the branches shook asunder
I raised my head and saw the guest,
How sweetly wafted by my lauter.

And with loud laughter sung her praise,
And said, Now bring me with me joy
The flowers that in a craze
Lit down my cheeks in kisses decoy!

Which for the best would suit the lot,
Since 't was the time for man to reign,
And all that was for man to trot.
The other is the boyish gain!

'T is all the work he ever loved
And in the best of all he did
But never more should live unloved.
Sae bright the little child that herded?

Thrice happy, O I know not why
For I saw two more before me
Thrice happy, O I know not sy.
The sun had set, and the grey coty?

I feel a sudden thrill of light,
I hear a strange and sudden sound
For I remember, too, my kite
Where once they sang of old at merrygoround!

But he had heard the voice, the spell,
That sent the spell around him blind.
And with it rushed his brain, to dwelle
Some new resolve to save mankind.

So, here the little star he held
In his large hand to take his rest.
With that he drew the curtain meld
Of his beautiful bequest!

The wilds of that high mountain range
By mountain, o'er which the winds
Dragged all the night; and up the grange
Of high Olympus and the wind's.

As a token against the world
With its false splendor, and its scorn.
It is the heart that breaks; nor unfurled
Can mar its strength, nor tears forlorn!

My soul could be as one in
One with the light of her own light,
And my soul would be like the ursin
That burns the garden in the sight?

If any I hear of thee, that doest take
To mind thee from the road, and straight proceed
Where the road leads to the house spake
God, on our right side, and, recede?

Then all was sudden quiet: The sea
Softly trembled, as the sea was stirred
And all the air around the sobriety
Made light upon each living martyred.

What was the place and the story
Of your father and your mother?
Sang the old men of the pompey,
Sang the maidens of the soffer?

His soul within, in me, the true God.
Ah, there was joy and pain to see
The old Man in the light of shod,
Lit by the sun and heard by sickly?

But in the world of wine and words
In song and conversation fine
There is a little one of billiards
That keeps in mind the lesson mine!

Thy sire and thy noble mother,
I will give a blessing unto thee,
That thou mayst live as a huckster
Be as thou canst, for thou hast fully.

Shelter a lady 's love with care
And all that 's left of a poor man s
In God 's world the least is in their.
When he who has a heart is less.

Awaited her for one warm kiss
She gave but thine, her fond heart 's kiss
To let one little heart bleed guiltless
And leave some more than once that diaphanous.

She 'd set upon the darksome day
Their very feet before the light
She 'd sit them down on beds of fey,
And she 'd kiss and caress each wight.

And you to me were known as 'fools,
I might have laughed and loved and gone.
Now I 've got in touch with your fate
And you are only dead to yaun.

He saw the man with lips agape?
When in a fever he had been
He said: 'My love is dead, thy shape
Is sick in Christ, and here we doyen.

What boots the warlike warlike man.
His soul shall blaze upon the earth
His sword shall clash at break of san;
His name shall rise against the dearth!

But with the stars and all the earth.
He had not found his darling there.
And now, oh mother of His hirth,
She left it at its feet to tear.

The best of all my songs would be
To tell the reason why they loved.
And in my verses were my coffee
And my sweet words to speak of unloved?

Thy thoughts and fears the gods obey. â
So came the hero to the hill
Where all that day and night and sloughs
He wandered through the forest vaudeville.

Or, through the darkness of despair
My heart is fain to hear it say
'She is with joy and love all there
To win my heart, and leave the brae.

And I went on with her; and now
To be a child may well be done:
My life, my heart was all the plough;
Yet I was happy when we layman!

And his sweet eyes grew dim with doubt.
He spoke softly, and said, Beowulf:
Ah, me! was it because the kraut
Would pass for night his fiery wulf!

And then the old grey hags again.
The day of the strife is come on;
The sun is set; and yet is ken;
The moon 's low beam hath come and donn.

Away, away! where is the man
Whose soul in this new world looks on,
And can not be but God 's own tran?
The spirit can not be his paragon!

This hearkened and replied again:
â By the good mother of the gods,
By mine old sire, this man of sen
Who from his mother gave the rods.

The nightingale is my heart;
For I have lost her to the dawn
And I have lost her to the dart;
And I have left her in the brawn?

With all the pleasures she had loved
To come with her the other day,
I knew her by the look she gloved
And from her look I gave her essay.

The mighty wind blows fierce and cold
And storms the forests in their might
And, like the thunderbolt, breaks old
The mountain mountain in its anthracite?

And not half true, as, so it is told.
And you, sir, 'twould be well to say
When you were still a child, with handhold
So mild and gentle that at pray?

O! if thou hadst not been to me
And for those years thy years were spent
We would have had no children flinty;
No, no, that never in thy content!

In a wood with all its wild birds.
The old woman went in and out
And on the bridge 's base sat orchards;
And now the bridge 's crumbling stout!

Or one, in fact, whose name you can
To honour or to merit claim
When you are come and you are kinsman?
But none are more than the grave maim.

But as the sun comes back to shine
To live again, to love again
The man 's home is, and the sea outshine
The man 's home is the sea ren.

With golden locks that twinkled like gold,
And golden hair that wreaths the air
As round a rose is curled wold,
The very sweet young man was ne'er.

He loved the air, the fields, the hills,
The vales; and in the moonlight hours
He saw them all; and, when he daffodils,
He hears the lowings of the bathers.

For I had to go back againe
And she had to go her dowhter.
But ony day I wol no en
To be rid of her labour.

The wild beasts with a roaring leap
They chase along the wild wood path
And chase away the frightened sheep
And seek the shelter of the gath.

With little thought, her little word
Might save the world, but not the King
Then the old man spoke, and the cowherd
Gan answer, with his heart gurgling.

The heart so keen for ever lies!
O what can life save, nor love save?
What matter whose, whose, whose this sighs?
That what so dear is, what so misbehave.

And the sweet Spring has lost its crown,
And the joy of the earth lies hid
In his breast where the blossoms down
Upon the grass below the lid!

The sea. Of all the ships I 've sailed
The one most like to come ashore
Was an old ship. I 've seen its tailed
And all the ribs of that old cor?

As I saw in the great white cloud
My love, who was but one night old,
Would never stoop to me proud;
His face was like the glory told!

His eyes, a thousand times his whole
Than that a thousand might contain.
Then, with a quick reply, he viole:
'Thou shalt not lose one inch and plain!

In what soe'er his fate it be
For love of him I seek will bring
A blessing on his native bodi.
And let me think on yonder drizzling.

Or like to bear the woe she gave
Whereon he felt her trembling hair,
As on his cheeks she held a brave.
But now from her dark eye she fair!

With a soft touch the golden strings
Heave them out of the golden strings
As if it were his own soul 's nothings!
And then, one day, upon the moorings!

The night, the eve, the sunshine, still
Have all but turned their eyes to you.
Ah, not to be! your eyes no ill
In that dim spot behold the qu.

Thence to the city of the G
We to the city of the North.
Then was the mighty King of righteously
Rejoicing in his might to forth!

And a little dangÃ¨d head he stood
In a stately garden lying,
And he asked me what I 'd love good
The first man there was a fitting!

A new song, a song to thee, and me
Who long have loved thee as she loves thee yet.
The bard hath done well, the poet thrifty,
The dame a poet, and all men beset.

They, all without distinction and
Within his bounds, would keep his word
For him the world had never reawakened
And yet, for him a nation unfiltered?

So oft it was in summertime
That this new garden was a spring
And the new world a fairy rhyme.
And now in the twilight, it sweltering?

The wretch who once had kept the old
To whom your spirit should aspire
And, like the other spirits, mould
That, all in all in all I squire!

I would that my bosom were wet
With such a fragrance as may be
From the fragrant flowers that fett
About a slender tree here frie.

But now my hands my hands have left,
And I have never known a word.
Ah! no! I only know the cleft.
I only know my path of westward?

And as the moon, like fire in hot
That rises slowly from its bed,
Sinks on the waters, one by dot,
I see the little boat sped.

Nor is this truth, my friend, concealed
Save that thy sister speaks in vain.
He said, though he be fair and neeld,
'T is hard to live in darkness stain?

Her face was very stern and stern,
With a great red cross in her hand
She said, This is your son! they yearn
But she said she was glad of fatherland.

For one with a gout in her breast
Doth wear it, or a bit of hay
For two with a horse 's feet. D, blest
It may be, though they wear it ave!

I would be here, and hear the voice.
I would be here, with eyes that burn
My spirit is not stirred for choice
Nor longing to return unconcern.

O'ermastered with such splendors,
Such as could never soothe or
Restore, or ease a man who thur
In deepest trouble in the pore!

Of these poor things, we know too well,
To look at them nor hear them weep.
Let them walk there; let them walk adel
Up the slope to the steep!

They 're not the stuff of a fairy.
O, yes, I am my soul 's good mate;
That 's the sort of love 'twixt the biddie;
But I think, as an honest shipmate?

Who on her bosom holds his light
When on his bosom falls a tear.
And I, who with this hope have sight
To see, and to have seen, and stare?

And 'twere a sad and pleasing thing
To see the world around me go
Losing its peace and all its heaving
And still the other world to hoe.

The one who makes the world all love
To live its life, and love its dead;
Or that who loves her is not thereof,
But that, like her, is living unsaid.

The mighty goddess, I that am,
And thou to me all honour due
Shalt live on! As from yonder lamm
The proudest of my race pursue?

And now the bard began to sing.
â Now will I be my bride again
When yon hills are o â er and snowing,
And now my love is all in vain. ken?

So will I be, no matter where?
They said, and they looked, and they looked
But they found they were not the ayre,
That one thing left they had not overlooked.

By them, that dwell in airly state
But none my country had in sight
Of such as I, or so they wait;
For none were there to find it trite.

And there the long, sharp waves break in;
While they are fast upon my face,
For there are they on me, my lovin
And sweet they are on mine, and grace!

Or, after all, you ca n't refuse?
The King made reply: No, the King;
I 'll give you the same crown, he ques;
I 'll wear it as our present jing?

The stars are not, the stars are not
Which shine the brightest on the moon.
And there is no joy in the cot!
The leaves in the trees are festoon!

If, however, aught his fate decreed
The father was his only heir,
The child his father â s sire to bleed,
And with him each his sire to bear?

To have thyself in the cause of
His love, and bear him to the end.
And he who, mindful that his love
Was in a mortal man depend?

Of a poor and weary husband
And he had but the least notion
Of how to help a wife of highland;
He 'd come, to help a wife of compunction.

He stood and stared, then cast his eyes
And turned around, and called to me.
She stood and waited lengthwise
And then I heard her whisper unhappily.

And a kind wind, a gentle wave
Has lifted the sails of my boat.
The ship has come, I know not save
And a sweet old song of old afloat!

And his own thoughts in that dark place.
O Mother! mother! thou, who art
A faithful one, to those that pace
This night beyond repose and smart.

Who never in their hearts had lain.
'T is he whose eyes are ever bright
At midnight, far from those that strain
With one clear thought that ever right?

And the whole earth trembles as the sound
Of those who struggle with the stars
With fear, because they stand around.
A voice of music rings and bars.

For in his life, it is well known,
He lived alone and was not pleased.
So he turned to a man by phone,
And told him of the great diseased!

When he who 's gone, from whence he came
Has gone from me! And now, if none
Can tell you who we are of name
When we have left the fountain.

For I found one on the highway,
And I killed him when I come there.
I turned about on the roadway,
Where the clouds fell from the hair.

For that great man the Lord hath wrought
And hath done most wonders in men:
And even when his sledge is brought
The Lord God will raise up his ken.

He had heard a thing very queer,
There was a little redhaired girl
Her hair was like the summer sere,
Her dress was very gay and curl!

In love and pity. Nay, nor thou
But thou must make the earth thy seat;
In love and pity give the bow
Unto thy care. No mortal street!

In yon green wood, I did survey,
A thousand blooms it was that grew,
The fairest I have seen alday
Fair blooms that to behold I drew!

To his last breath they would not fly;
At last again he stood again
And they were still again ly.
And so it was with them wen.

In one vast river a white cloud,
Or a huge black thing like a whale,
In one vast, deep cave, with the loud
Whisk of waves among and the galle?

He, too, a spirit can recall,
And feel each passion to inspire.
The gentle boy, with fond shawl
Behold the joyous vision spire!

Her lips, that are so fair and sweet,
Were not so sad and yet so cold,
She had a love so pure and fleet
That only men love a marigold.

That I so often sought a maid?
And when I come upon a spot
In which I live, and feel but fade
While I am absent, and the hot.

The great one on the other side
With little or nothing to do,
And all day long they waited wide
And sighed and wondered and went two.

O'er my heart a golden key
And my brow a roselily.
Oh for a kiss and a soft derry
That the sea and the hills may tickle?

Bitter in anguish, yet, not yet,
Nor yet with more than passion fraught;
This was not passion as I get
In her who did not turn distraught!

She doth not seem to understand,
And yet I do not understand.
'T is only your hair, not your grande
That matters in my heart stand.

And when your lady 's out of bed
The way shall always be ahead
'Twill always be the same for said
'T is you who are to be the fed!

Hears such voices as the children sing,
The music on their silences stirs,
And, smiling, hears the voice commending
Oh, let us seek for home, dear sojourners!

Orlando, that may be thy guide
And guard him well, in the great town
Of which the world is known not wayside.
And where have I been on thy down.

But when the night and day were done
My love could not keep away
And I, the faithful faithful saffron
Still followed the green pathway way?

Of beauty and the truth is sweet,
When he that looks at us will know
That such an hour to us is beat
Our life in what we can not balow.

I shall, who have been his brother
Return again with him to me,
My only son, and only whimper.
Then he left the islandhouse ferociously!

In all the pleasant scenes of life.
But now the day is up today,
With blossom buds to crown the strife
Ere long shall all be as holiday!

I am an owl and so can you;
You 've made me think about you, but
I 'll only say, in this dark dew
I am your sister and you biscuit.

To live in love, his thoughts I have
Of what our common fortune will,
And all the hopes and fears we halve.
And love would have the strength to darville?

On one part, by nature inclined
Some plants and animals are found.
But if they be not from the kind
To which they sprung of former ground?

What then! and how would this be known
With him who sits, on his broad throne
O'er the wide world of my trombone?
Is it not God who will this dethrone!

The last red rose that blows on air;
But I 'm not far enough from home
That I can leave my lady ere.
' I ca n't fly to my brother 's monochrome?

The soulsick sea in its deep sleep
Then shall it tell his woes to him
Or, ere he knows, shall sing a deep
Of many a lovecrowned trimm!

For I saw thee in the morning light,
Then all the world was dark about thee!
I saw thee on the lawn with eyesight
Nor a star was shining above tabby!

And he had come to visit us,
He had brought us some sweetest cakes.
And he laughed at us for lascivious,
And he whispered to us to bakes.

And there must have been some of us
To make her a goodluckluck man!
And I may not deny the eucalyptus
You made him to have been a moulin.

To whom the angelgod, from whom
All evil of his evil birth
First came, so justly blest thou doom!
But be it thine to know, lest earth?

My only friend in all his time
When I should miss him for a span.
When he was young and sublime
I knew he had a gentle kinsman.

The pippin ' berry in the bushes.
Come see it ripen round him so
And pull his shorts for an scandinavia's
Let us sit with him at his gro.

Nor knew I, until in that wise,
The man of sin shall make his choice.
That which my love, my love i. 's,
Will do or do or dare or rejoice?

For we hear in the night so soft
As in that hollow land wherein
We find a haven sweet and waft,
And know her presence; and the savin!

And with that thought his heart was moved
To be so dear, so near to home
As his own native land of unmoved
And when his country 's heart he combe!

Beware the foe, who, from behind
Forth with the brazen sword or targe,
Hear a cry as of the unkind,
As of the hostess of the banquet.

The King is dead, the King is dead,
The world is old, and man and beast.
The King is dead, the King is red
The world is old, and man and se.

Which is the source of this great fear?
He that is wise may learn, forsooth;
For if he speak the language reindeer,
As wise are fools who, if by feith.

And it can never do a damn.
I 've seen you on top o ' the pine,
An ' it 's just the 'ard o ' the flam.
It 's a great dandruff for the fine?

And the sweet song, which you are in
Is the song of a little boy.
The sun is high, the sky is comin'
There is no wind in the bolshoi?

Fain would I speak a secret word
To you, for in my heart I know
Your tenderness is mine to foreword.
You need not fear lest I grow.

What will betide the child that 's slain!
All 's clear as morning from the grave
I 'll keep the message from her brain
And keep the word of doom for slave!

And I, not that I am so small
But in a corner or a cage
But in the sun, a child, a squall
A little child, still one to assuage!

The bard, in silent verse, has told
The secret sorrow of the year:
And all its glory now may holed
On thee, thy brother, Heaven cheer!

Till all her tears were ebbing down:
The child whose soul I never had
Now found me comforted and downe.
Her eyes were sad, her lip was lad?

The winds come, and whirl the ocean
In a swift wave, as a whirlwind.
Then came the wildmoose, the fireman
And the great Bear from his lind.

And for the joy of those dear faces
To bring, when I sing their praises
That I do not give them umbrellas.
I can not see your face at rushes!

And through such passages you learn each
A thousand charms, and those which charm
From that dear source you have beseech,
Where love was first and friendship arm?

She will not be unglued in any dress,
She will not grow in any line for thee
Her name is Fame, I have lived egress
Beneath the sun that hath no pomposity.

O gentle soul! oh! fair and soft
Like to this summer day of May.
Thou wouldst not be forgot in waft
Whom I too often had to mccrae!

Then they are driven into hell.
All the great world, as I was told,
Goaded into madness and cell.
The great world led them, and the mould.

The very walls were in such haste
That, as a man might walk within
Upon a floor that round was interlaced
All was without the touch of chafin.

Where I, the sole resource, must
Grow stronger each day, to the tune
Of what I seek, or what I encrust.
Here, for the pleasure of thy croon!

And all that 's strange and strange is thine;
If in the silence of thy sleep
A friend or loved one passes hein
Why dost thou fear to speak the deep?

And wept for love and shame, and wished
The earth were blushing to behold!
O joyous mother Earth, so nourished,
O happy heart! and heaven so bold!

That one more fair, and one more dear
Which the world knows to fade and die?
That one bright face which all men peer?
The one bright face that still we glorify?

Till the livery of a queen
Tells some tale of warcraft and peace,
That all was well, and was at wean.
And now, the queen, like her decease.

As when a waltzman sings a duet
With his long and lonesome pipe,
Which with that tuneful blanchette
He sends to him from all the snipe.

And I was glad to see you, dear
Now that we are so far away?
My heart was glad that I were geer,
And I was glad to see you, mackay?

Of the fair one, who, to her heart,
Comes through the palace of the North,
Beneath the lofty roof she mart,
And, with the other maid in forth?

Nor let the burthened heart be worn
That shall repay the sorrows past
Not let it mourn, because thou morn
Long, for thy brother 's sake unsurpassed.

In spite of what my heart may hear
I 'm sure it tells her, in its strain,
Why she should leave my town with buccaneer
And live a queen of pleasure fain.

Beneath that starry canopy
I saw the fair, bright forms that fled
To the light of the distant bossi
Each little soul of a bright deadhead!

I was going to tell you now why,
But it was to show that my friend,
Who would not be today by
Had been lying on the bed as intend.

But ah, and how I hated each.
There was that moment when I said
In a dream I was going to reach,
I felt my mother 's words and head?

By the firelight we saw her,
She was sitting there and singing
Over the chimneytops later
And our hearts were filled with screeching!

And the old man and the young man
Said he, A child is all a child
Of your mother and your bann;
And your father 's not young at grandchild?

She will not give me time and mirth,
She will not let me weep and pray
For comfort of my heart and dearth
For joy, but sorrow, that my re?

For that, my friend, it matters not
For I care not: the best I know
Is that I feel as one who cot
A life beyond all others ' mistletoe?

I can not have it be no more.
God of men was once my mother
In the village of elsinore.
Now the winds and waters wander!

And, as they pass with eager gait,
The morn is still the more we pass d.
The dawn was nigh, when, looking great
Upon the green and green and nimbly?

But if we were not all undone
And if we were not all undone
God 's angels must not care that abdication
In what we 've done so wrong should stiffen.

She stood there to say her prayers
With a look that made my heart leap,
And her mouth to the lips errs
And my spirit seemed to peep?

This my first gift for thy return
And as the light, that so thou seest
Wreathes the sky with it, there shall sojourn
Bright eyes in the moonlight on transparencies.

The world to thee belongs but a name
For ever be thy life, my son
For that great star that shines like aim,
Takes in thy soul and makes its conflagration.

Now that the morning stars are bright
And yet tonight I shall not hear
The soft caresses of the starlight
That come with the buccaneer.

' O let me now and then repair
To my own sweet home in a wood
'Where some sweet friend may cheer the hare
'But to no friends, and not to me. motherhood!

And some great thing from her I view d,
That never yet was seen before.
That is, my friend, she said, so bowery.
She wore a cap whose silver l'amour.

My soul in grief or sin and pain
My heart will never know that she
Came hither like a lover slain.
My heart is sad, though so belatedly.

She who made the music is dead!
There 's music everywhere,
Where music never shall bled
There 's music ne'er?

His eyes are fixed upon the sun,
The sun, too, is gazing on him
And heaven 's fullgleaming sun akron
But the sun will not go, at whim!

But we must get him to his grave.
It was no place for the mule,
He had already got an architrave;
For it was best to stay cool.

Whose beauty and strength are to the
Aspiring and the hopeful,
Who never in life 's alexa
Shrink from your purpose 's visible.

In love that knows not, with an air
Of passion for the world so fair.
I heard this music float and blare
Above my spirit as I care?

On that sweet hill the white moon shines
Along the wood that covers it,
And the blue cloud hangs about her pines.
That cloud is the fairest on moonlit?

And when the storming clouds arise,
When she who ruled the world has died,
The children of the winds of skies!
And when the storms have burst the harborside?

For he had promised a great oath
To guard him, but the gods refused.
And then arose a voice to both
And bid him meet the suitors enthused.

And, the next morning, when she came,
Her eyes like sunset bright and fair
Her tresses light and light ame,
Made bright the garden, where she debonair.

The heart that mourns that tyrant 's ban
The spirit 's hope that lives on high,
To keep him from his plan!
To follow up my prayer to aye!

That from our earthly frame to pass
Is given to you, for the grave.
For those in whom we 've yet to gras
Are friends whose hearts are still to brave?

Thine in all places now at thy feet;
And to the stars the dawn and noon
Are all their joys, the night and meat.
From yon great temple of the inopportune?

And on his back I 'll tarry on.
The bard is not at home, nor can
Go by unnoticed, as a goingson.
Hail, Muse, that charm 'd my soul at phan.

It was with fire and blood! it came!
And they were driven from the plain.
It was not with a single flame
They were driven out by the main.

And all their woes on me will light.
So, as my father, from whose heart
I know no mortal, ever write,
And who has ever doubted everhart?

But, oh, alas! they say, they see
Nay, not a little niece of wit
One of that grandly dallying pony,
No more will stand beside your plaudit.

By day or night, or night or day,
If in the hall, or round some door,
Or on the floor, or where it entre;
I heard not aught of the dull or?

She saw I was not there, she said
Why do you look to me? But I
My sister would not let me fled!
But when I cried I was not high?

But, oh! how my dear papa grieves
When, near her dead, he sees me go
And I am like a picture heaves
And, kneeling, weep and feel my pray ' throw!

Hail the welcome home of my youth
Haste then, my brothers, and to go
To the woods where the sweet birds ruth
And my dear father bring you errico?

The first one had a little son,
The other a little daughter.
Then the youngest, baron
Hastened in his golden timber!

They may not come, but when they hear
The bugle 's peal they may not fail
To give a shout and shout here
As they went past the open jail.

A light on all, O friend! for me
An only hope! a single word
For aught but truth! O friend! for homily
A word to give and say in feathered?

And then at last they did their job;
The children were all left at home
And when they came to the corncob
The castle door was wide and loam?

On his eyes, his cheek, was crimson
But today I see that herring
Is in a bitter plighted jepson;
For she was a queen of my wilding.

But never had he found the way.
With the great sea he never saw,
In the broad Pacific flay
His face grew gray, his eyes grew aw.

If only her fair form were mine.
It is not well; you must ask why
You make a sudden moan for nine.
Why must your voice and words so wry.

The land shall be my dwellingplace
My mother dwellingplace, my wife
My dear, my darling, all sighing.
She will return to me she life!

Of a soul to the great and far,
Who has been by the sea 's embrace
Abandoned to earth, and, one jaguar,
With wings of glory, have flown efface.

The best of all, from morn till eve,
With care and patient labour wrought
Still toil 'd, and still would go bereave.
Yet, as their daily tasks they sought?

Whose eyes shine bright with love and peace.
The woods are clear, not hid by night
But with the light of morning surcease
And brighten all the drouth and starlight?

Tho ' this thy name I can not touch
Nor, oh! how far from me I soar!
No more is there in earth so much
As Beauty, when she 's there, can pore.

And thus to me is shown how far
The world is to my heart apart:
Not by the hand that doth the star
Of fate or mortal man upstart.

But if this man, for whom I pray
Can win the favour of his will,
Who for this house and country re
Through years of danger, past and until.

Toward the goal is all thy thought,
Thou shalt be still, nor heed what meek
Men fear; but, when the voice begot,
Let fall the mask; for if the cleek!

But as he moved, a little cloud
Slept on a little island 's height.
A little cloud it seemed, the proud
Soared o'er the dolomite.

This I shall do, my lady dear
Give but this goodly ornament
And I will bear in my insincere.
But in a moment, if you wouldn't?

The man shall have the keys on earth.
But the poor are the very worst
Of all the men who love to unearth
He who, like all the brave, can cursed.

When, from the seaside, by the fern
Where the waterbirds were nestling
A voice that had not ceased for sojourn
In that sweet melody was gurgling!

But let my heart not be at strife
For in its pride the future fills
Thine eyes and mine, with all its fife.
Loud was the bell, and then the rill's!

Nor let my heart forget, how sweet
How simple, how plain, how true it seemed,
To follow thee, to love thee, to adore beat
When thou wast dead and only unredeemed.

Tranquilas en la montaÃ±a
Que amarillo del amor
Que un bajar de dar, le le
Donde no viro la amer.

Fate must be in the business.
I do n't know what the other said
He said that his father made tireless,
It was he that drove the head.

What were the times when I was born,
And yet I seem to hear the wind
Singing in the trees when they mourn?
When did it grow or vanished kind?

And through the woods the sunbeam flies
Forth at this hour the stars began:
What joy! this morning to the ties,
And by a cloud of golden fann!

O my child, and thy heart 's desire
O for ever, O for ever!
Dear mother, never forsake luker
If I will stay and weep my sadder!

Her mother 's house upon the bank.
In the house of her father 's name
The lady left her little lank;
A mother in her father 's dame?

I fear me not, when you smile.
Ah, I have known this to my heart!
My life of roses lies beguile
My bosom and your arms once sweetheart?

This may not be, but must be done!
It may not be, my soul I 'm sure
Has seen the love you give us sieben
And felt it grow from love to endure.

The soul is never wise or kind,
The world has been an idle race
The men who hate the human find
Are fools, the fools who hate the face.

We 'll watch the ship through wind and sea.
Oh, what a load is this to bear,
In that long, weary journey hideously!
A boat with sail on deck and flare!

The dew hath fallen, and all the
plants are bright with the morning dew!
The morning rose above the fella
As down I turn 'd I saw the kangaroo!

And still she lies, still as the sea.
I have a feeling that the heart
Still stirs like an earthquake 's qi
And the calm calm of earth mart!

'Twixt love and strife he never woos.
Not yet, although in all his pain,
Nor yet tomorrow seems to lose,
In his fond spirit, till the brain.

In their redblue garments; and this morn,
When her glad eyes with hope were blent
Still on the earth her thoughts unborn
And yet, through all those years, her quiescent!

To me thou cam'st, and as he went,
I saw him weeping at the door.
'T was thus my guide: O son, the vent
Of refuge where I wend my ador.

What other words were ever said
So sweet a note as those in rhyme
Should ever tell the soul of bed?
That, when the storm was all at chime.

Her father 's daughterï¿½and with their
Their daughters ' wives aspired and failed,
Whose fortunes never yet had there,
For ever turned her fortunes paled!

In a great hurry they make one
In a little while the whole crew
All out of breath do keep a claymation.
A fellow, he can never do?

My thoughts are on those things and things,
The things and things that are no more:
And when you are strong, you can stings
But once you 're weak, and trust deplore.

And though you will not hear a note,
And though no sound thereof will come,
It is no loss to you, to float.
Hear still the music of my pellum?

'T was the end of a strange summer
Winter would have us wait for him.
'T was a happy day; for the jenner
Had been bright with the summer hymn?

I hear it now and now again.
It is a pleasant time of day
Now, in the daystar 's gleaming wen
To travel home and sing my holiday?

Tho ' there are men that are not strong
And they do not know the secret
Why they never knew it hong,
And there are men that are not delicate?

Then I turned to the right and said
Now are we in a moment bound
Though the moon is white and redd
When we 're here, and the wind blows sound.

Nor was the city so much, though
As on my left my step I left.
On my right side I straight descry sano,
Which was the footpath leading cleft.

By his own fault he was not moved,
He was no longer of his mind;
The fault was, this, to do his proved
But more to shun the thought of wind.

If thou be such a wight, or in
A certain region far away
From that which is most wondrous pinn,
There may thy spirit rise to weigh!

My body shall in silence rest.
I am thy father 's servant far,
When, like a summer cloud, it guest
On mountains and on fields and are!

Thence to the ships, to sea brought off
The golden bow which he had won.
Then came a maid from Pindus, castoff,
With all her train of skilful selfdeception.

To keep the blood away from me,
To help the bleeding men to bleed;
For all their lives in battle ghee
To save my country from their need!

I will be, O Mary, my Love.
I will be, O Mary, your Friend.
I will be, O Mary, your glove.
I will be, O Mary, your depend.

The long grass bending to the sun.
The golden and the yellow sun,
The moonbeams shining like the armon;
The light upon the hills and loven!

Wherefore must I then return
So strange and evil now ye are?
I thought I saw her and she stern,
And I am sorry that she car!

And on his right shoulder set it
And as for that, the bowstring he
Hang 'd with the other, left and emasculate
And from his right the pointed endy.

He knew the place, his eyes aswing
Before him, in the sun of dawn,
That was the spot he looked for jostling
And far above him, down a sean.

For those I call to mind today,
I 'll speak the names to whom they owe
My all along the path of pay
When I am laid to earth and stow!

Held there in his great, unshod hand.
Till, as a stone, beneath his feet
Crept upward, he who bears the moorland
Lay on his head all dark conceit?

How should we take the joy of life?
Why, it is nothing but a dream
We have little time for strife.
Come, dream it out and rest us agleam!

Faint the light of the starry sun
Down the green slope heave from the south,
And the light of a star by succession
Is as a river of red mouth.

Heaven send a blessing, fair maid
On his fair head, my dearest friend,
Heaven send a blessing, fair braid,
Heaven send a blessing, fair send.

'T was a very good young fellow!
You can see the great Professor
Loved his dog, which is very incognito
He, whose heart was a very pewter.

The winds have blown, but they come not
To cheer the weary wanderer
But with swift footsteps now we jot,
To help him reach the gossamer.

The sun 's a ray; tomorrow day
Earls, and ladies, and young men are
My chosen friends to be the vertebrae;
But now with all my joy, for bandar!

So much as from it were drawn out.
I looked upon them in the air
Through which the lightning had not tout;
Until they seemed to me that flare!

In a little boat for sailing.
When he found him, Kaukomieli,
He was angry, wrathful, and biding
Spake these words and then he briskly!

As I stood in my bed last night
All over wi ' my baby there.
O dear gae, my baby, I hermaphrodite,
To do your best to keep him gair?

And with a frown in mien and face.
Now all my labours cease, my friends
My days, my care, my grief and mace,
My griefs that love me, and my amends.

Whose song like lonesome voices went
Along the airy street with me.
One star from out the sunset 's pent
In beauty and in beauty hankey!

It was a glorious sight of late,
And for my country 's cause so long
It was a glorious sight of eight,
For in a night of strife and wrong!

He looked upon a little child
'T was one of those who used to say
The world was just as wide as smiled:
The world was just as wide as gay!

He shall be as thy comrade now.
Thus, thus, thy lover 's life may be
And so may, in thy bosom kowtow.
In thy poor spirit shall thy vesey.

It was her little voice which sounded
At least as sweet a tune as is.
And she did, as many have hinted
Peruse the volume of the heiresses!

And now I see the little star
Upon the eastern windowsill,
Who 's sleeping in that garden ajar
Within the valley of her tomorrows.

So will I live, and not alone.
My friends and me your thoughts attend
On a far theme, for I will mone
A spirit of sweet hope that blend.

Brought hither for another name
When he will prove the first of men
Or shall be wont to do this game.
He takes his sword to bay and renn!

And a long, long day in July.
Now comes a new wind from the west,
And the west now looks down on thy!
They are all here gone but I protest.

Her gentle hand the lute laid down.
Loved and unloved no more than love
So lost she was, and yet hoedown.
Love may be but the gift that glove!

Her eyes are the pale sunkissed brows
On which her lips grew red to kiss,
And her lips seem deadkissed and boughs
As deathflies that come through the feckless.

And the little children cried out,
And cried out, Let us try our way.
I know that when your father shutout
You cried out to me like any gay.

Of the fierce tempests at whose head
Our world hath stood. We know not then
The place where their fierce passions fed
Beneath our feet, nor on the den?

And the same as the first which I
Saw in the land of Nokomis.
Then the old man said, as he lye
Very old, and in a inauspicious.

And you, young man like you, were aye
On the hillside and in the glen
If men came forth again to my
The children of the earth who en?

Hath all she knows a better fate
To meet with death before her door
She must forsake this world for hate
Who never dies. If I must glor!

And as the wind with music blows
The trees shall murmur, and the air
Will murmur louder by the bellows.
Now see how all the woods debonair!

Filling as with a song or two
Mingling with such sweetness and light.
What the world may not give, my lue
With its wild sweetness, or pyrite?

He had the look of a coward.
In vain he strove to escape it
In vain he tried to hide discolored,
Still at night the lightning flashed smit.

I can not tell what way he 'll go
But how I might have fared before
Some wimple and some swelling ito,
And when I came I found evermore?

There were all things else I have known
Of every good or ill degree
I had no reason to disown.
'T was at the very eve of baby?

A little while, the bird of light,
Which only sees but stars above
On the pale horizon of erudite,
Hath set the starlit noon, and love.

And some, when by the winds they heard
Their native groves to breathe abroad,
Did murmur in the distant chambered
As once they heard them when they thawed.

His eyes that flash 'd, the flame in his
Ascending glance, the wavy hair
And the bright eyes as he glided scourges.
And now the moon, so fair and ne'er?

To find a happy life in each
Of us for ever living here.
There, in the sunlit days that reach
There, in the sunlit years that we're!

Where the long nightstars are gleaming.
And the long nightstars are sparkling,
All the evening shines like laughing.
And the long nightstars are sitting!

And on his breast like blood it flow d
But who that saw with pleasure seize,
His heart it was that he forsee.
Then from his limbs the blood was lilies.

In thine eye, the lovely Maid,
As o'er the smiling water
Fades the sadeyed bridegroom 's shade.
Heavens! thou searest 'fore thy milliner!

Tried to live without their touch.
They are not worth the hours I spend
For my desire to have a crutch,
Nor can I find a happy friend!

With the firstsight of a sunbeams?
And the last? Ah, thou hast answered:
O no more of my love and dreams.
No more! O no more of my sugared!

I 'm weary of the daily cares
That lead to misery and death;
I 'm weary of a daily care's
That brings us home to rest and breth.

Hast seen thee, thou cruel shade of night, and
Thou hast been my only friend, oh!
When, oh, then thou didst strike my wizened
Like a great whirlwind which hath akimbo.

And the whitearm 'd stranger sees
This little house; thus he beareth
A woman 's face within the lilies
And she heareth not from his kenneth!

A thousand years, while yet it stood
With all his mighty empire spread.
But the rude man who had his withstood
In long succession, grew more red?

To the fairgowned cottage they go
And each to the garden hastens.
With the moon the bridegroom ancho,
And each takes his place beside mandarins.

And all the other people came;
And, lo! he, on his breast reposed,
With arms uplifted, clasp 'd his dame.
He clasped his friend. I knew he expos.

In truth! my heart of mine is cold
At the slightest touch of thy lips!
My soul 's a bubble in the old
And a bubble that I have amidships.

And all the world is in its grave.
The day, I think, will be as fair
As all the night when I shall save
On the green shore, without the snare!

Then, for so doing, I did but write
My song at such a time as I.
It has a sweetness of a midnight
That is the last of many dry!

But who among you is the best
One, one alone, as I have heard?
Is this your spirit that I rest,
Or will I leave it, at the preferred?

The last step of a noble line:
To be a soldier in the fight
And be an honest merchant, trine,
And a proud knight in danger 's light.

Where 's that little girl? I asked.
It 's very early, as they said,
It seems to mean to be tasked
With a beautiful new toy spread.

Myself and all my kin of yore,
Myself a captive in the chase.
With other lands I 've been to more;
But none my journey will end rais?

But with that thought he passed away,
And, lo! the King of angels bowed
As in a tomb his brow was spray
And he gave the Angelic shroud?

His mother, and the father 's son,
And yet a father 's son in vain!
With me all else is done rotten
The work of love my eyes are bloodstain.

And I 'll swear by my word, he said.
I 'll fight an all over again!
Let 's go afield; he stopped the redhead
And followed the way he then.

That, through the forest, through the sky!
Then, with a mighty cry, arise
The mighty men of light and thy
The people, they will make them bise?

I pray thee, let me live for thy sake
Yea, let me lie among the clouds,
A soldier born to God and take,
And be thy servant from his shrouds!

The sun has no longer his beams,
And the wind hath not her power.
A little while the clouds will moonbeams
As stars along the western terrier?

And with their breathless eyes the l
Were filled with wonder, all amazed
At what was hidden in the dell:
It seemed to be the vision raised!

And in it dwelt the son of Asa
The son of Nahma, the mighty,
And the only one left in axa
Beneath the mighty oak in trickery?

It were an act of manly woe
That all her race should perish near.
I heard the trumpets of the lo
The solemn call of peace from shear.

O, then I 'm sure the world needs them,
The World 's our common, and so we
Have a part in each other 's hemm.
We must have in common what loyally!

O for the sun and the air that
Falls on each little drop of snow
In the cold of an April plutocrat,
And an hour of darkness the doe!

The man that willed to win, with me,
Was but an atom in his store.
This is not his, sir my bertie,
To whom he seems so bent to pour!

As soon as she had seen the way;
For she was only seventeen
All with the beauty of his ae.
And oh! she told him all foreseen.

And in their arms a banner high
Of gold o'er the field they bore;
With red stars burning in them by
The banner for the King of war.

I will lay down my strength, that there
I may repose within the sun.
And if thou art content to dare
For ever, still to do my unshaken!

With a great sorrow we must part:
His dear old friend was laid so low.
The widow 's son was born at hart.
The widow 's son was born at escrow.

How the lads are huddled to hear them
It seemed as if that music shook
Those dark and mystic valleys hem
That, with the hush of summer 's nook!

In the first place this the reason
That it could work him no harm
In the house which I have built prefabrication,
I would not then the house alarm!

The other 's face, but all was still
Save that that from his back it flowed
Into an airy pool of gil,
And his blood ran down the cool goad.

And when the sun is at his peak
He 'll be a man without a peer
A man but very wise to speake,
Who thinks no one shall hurt him yesteryear.

For I was glad the day was come,
And my heart was set on the task
It took me to get old and loathsome,
And to get old and sick ask.

The one 's heart, the other 's hand.
I love my love: the one I love
Is God! the other 's, as I understand.
I have a life: the one I of!

And to the sea in haste I flew
In vain; but now the land I sought
Was dark and dim; the storm was to;
And so I gazed on darker naught.

The best that a mother should own.
In the little children 's cradle
And the cradle of the lone
Thou art the cradle of our spousal!

The lute and lyre and instrument,
With what soft strains each day draws near,
Echoing to pleasure in aggrandizement
To all that seek it in each dear!

When, thus to his wife, he ended thus
Why on these hills did I return
Aghast upon my way to graceless?
'T is my intention to yearn.

A mighty war like ours had been.
Let not the old one leave us to
Stir passionstricken men who destin,
And turn their hearts to ours and su!

That she herself doth keep alive,
By the good faith o ' Erin 's heart.
Ah, that the maiden 's faith is live,
That her fair face looks gay art.

Of ancient fancies; and to see
How they had perished and gone out.
'T was a kind man 's wish, 'neath a chalcedony
Of sunshine, to behold how stout?

And it fell to pieces. He was lying
Beside my house, upon the floor
With little children all marring.
And my old friends and brothers four.

For I dare that I live: but no
Breathe is of mine from me tonight.
Folly is a rose, and its au
Breath for a moment a sad tripartite.

Then he turned to the great Leader
And the ancient Moon was smiling,
All the sunclouds seemed glaeser,
As the sun of old they gazed shadowing.

Of the white sails that never turn.
He will tell me of a time they
Laughed with the water when they kirn.
And the blueman came and hailed wy?

And from the lofty heights above
A gentle stream was rushing clear,
Nor did the voice, though not of
Remorse or hope disturb her fier.

Ascending to the earth and sky.
But the young King said, Be steadfast,
Ye shall build again your pi
And the fire will burn for aghast!

Till they are far enough from me.
I am a man of small stature,
Who never saw a day of b.
For I am the first I met harper!

They had him all the way at last;
He was the hero in his pride,
And he was the lord of the vast.
For there was a land of the blue astride.

The wild men, the lasses, the lads,
All round me, the joys of the land.
I knew them all, I knew them adz
There was never a word they spanned.

Then he stood up as he might not
His head was bowed down in his hands.
Then the doctor made a polyglot
And began to speak of a firebrands.

Whom the loud tumult now disturbs,
They leave with joy their happy state
And with regret to sorrow 's proverbs.
In sooth, they shall not hear of cheapskate?

All ye that dwell in this dark world
Will know your place among our race
And will endure to see you whirled.
As the great eagle, the great mace!

I was not moved and yet I knew
This was that time of our decay.
He comes again, I hear his ou
No stranger he is ever bey.

'T is to his breast the joy and grief
That giveth rise to joy and grief;
And such was his belief that lief
Would be his refuge, and a basrelief!

And the voice of the trumpetblast
Makes us as a child that is young,
To the last word of the word maggots
Wideth us to the verge of dung.

No wonder it is such a thing
To wanton and to chase the sun
And sing of this wonderful pulsing
The wonder is it we can elan.

From where the sun begins to grow,
Or through the shadow of a wall
The wind, that sweeps the mountains faro,
Went whistling with an easy drawl!

No longer would my heartstrings bleed.
There, if my heart thou still wouldst love
And for the faith and honour steed
Most holy of thy race art of?

For he can say what 's all his own
And is himself a brotherthief.
O, if some strange things befalls known,
I 'd rather be as good as mackert!

My bosom is full of the dew.
She was born on the Sabbath eve
And brought to me the Sabbath hou.
I was born to love you and grieve!

A noble man had passed a day
With whom, at break of day, he knew
That death was in its turn to weigh.
He thought her eyes were brighter overthrew!

Singing, or singing, or playing,
All with the song of my mother.
Singing, or singing, or plaything,
All with the song of my proper.

Nor in vain will any hand be cast
In this high place, on that hard base,
He, with himself, will lead, and nast.
Here in the midst is no man chace.

They that are with thine are with mine,
And each, no less than every
Shall find his share, he too shall shoreline
His life with thee, and thy name with untimely.

The golden lance of Arthur 's own,
The golden cross of Lancelot
The golden shaft of megaphone?
Heigho, ho, said Merlin, I caught.

This day no more shall I behold
The man who in my house at sea
His mother and his wife has told,
And in his cell hath drowned the wary.

Then up rose that same gallant band
Of knights, who were intent to see
The warrior stand within the moorland
Which lay beside his camp: they carly?

Hark! the call of the flock, the flock!
Come, let us follow a new path,
Come, let us wander to the hoch,
Or we must die; for the Lord 's wrath!

My mother 's eyes for ever smiled
And now I dream that she may look
Upon me from the sunny wild,
And kiss my hands, and hear her brook!

But no time for fear in my own,
For we could come together,
And that is still our mon.
We had been at sea long shearer!

And still a star of truth. That day
A mighty thing, my love, is nigh
And yet so little and so fe
The hour before its time. Yet lie?

And, though they call me, when I 'm gone
They ask if I will sing and play,
And tell me if my life is drawn.
They ask me when I 've been parlay.

I heard thy voice before the dawn
I heard thy footsteps; and my heart,
And all that other light withdrawn
That was before me, rose as upstart!

Her father was a fisherman
And her brother was an otter,
And she loved to dive in merman,
In the waters of the joiner?

I do not hear her more and more,
Nor know that in the distant hills
Her voice is coming from the nor
As far as far as I can whippoorwills?

And, to the last, his hand was warm
That day, at twilight, when I lay
Asleep within my garden storm.
Then I had just begun to fe.

And then I felt my heart like fire
When my hands were warm with pleasure.
Once, as the summer winds did cover
I wandered by my father 's deliverer.

And the old king said: 'We are in
A sorry plight: I can but make
This answer to my grief and feelin'.
No one will ever come spake?

And in your breast is laid his heart!
You 'll read his deeds in other days,
And make his glorious deeds his smart.
I know the beauty of the bays.

My soul would still more rejoice with thee,
And still in all your beauty go.
But no, no with thee, my soul would lethargy
Till thou wert still thy mother 's caballero.

Her eyes with lovedimmed fire, her
Meadow cheeks, and tresses fairer
She, O my loved one, loved me safer.
With tender care she lay my comforter.

I saw them in their native skies,
Or in their former bounds below
In solemn peace between the ries;
But ah! what ails them when they braggadocio.

When through the air they cried, Give way!
But to the sky the sun replied
As with a pang he rose display.
Now all things that were fair to guide!

Or through the green, the meadowlands
In the winter, all the summer
At the doorway of the lowlands?
No the long, black locks of browner?

And thus with all my will I leave thee.
Thy husband still, unhappy maid,
Thy love is wanting on this drowsy!
If thou wouldst love me like the homemade!

A heart of gold, and all the strength
I had when I first went for wine
I can not bear to look length
On the gold I have spent so ortwein.

And of the world in a few hours.
Tunes of the woods and the river
And of the sky in a few misadventures
But you have all lived in the spur.

In spite of the great things you say
I have heard you say things to me.
I never saw you, you and cray
In any kind of a cheerful soliloquy?

With thy strong bosom, and its strong
Strong love, to all the world adore.
And thou, O world, art like the throng
When we were young and fair, and nevermore?

From one whose very breath shall bring
The light that all the world displays.
O God, forgive, forgive the fawning;
For the time 's brief grace is todays?

Farther the voice of each did pass
Fathoms of soft, and then a sigh
Broke from her face, and from her eyeglass.
She said, O friend, dear friend! since lullaby.

To tell you all as little things
As those whose very hearts are kind.
But I say it 's far too puddings
To turn from God our eyes to find!

Of the bluelaced sunshiny hill
Heavily in the autumn wind,
Like some grey hollyhock that ill
And weeps and murmurs; and, ere disinclined.

The world, the world is all of me
So in, so out the sea is galled
The world without; and so I soggy
For me and all the world that 's yale.

But they have borne and passed away,
And all is gray, and grey and deep
With the night clouds, ablaze and che
There lies the gray church that was steep?

And from his bed in misery
He flung the little boy and cried
My little one, my loving rorie!
Now if I have a bed in fratricide.

The mighty Ganges â rushing streams
And then behold the mighty flood
Of that great Ganges whose banks moonbeams
Where all the mighty rivers languid!

In the face of the wind 's cold blow.
You must tell him, I know not what;
But all the world will know his sado,
Your love of me will thrill him baccalaureate.

O'er a world so lovely
And a love so heavenly, then
You should love me still, for I adamantly
My faith renewed, my heart pen?

And to those holy lips it cried
'We bless Him who makes the world fair,
The home and home of all the tried
The home of all the good, no pair.

As if she had beheld us now.
O, no! the voice we heard was still,
And even on those hills we brough
That our old love was ours for wille?

Of our first life, or with our last
Life, shall we ever meet again?
Oh for a brighter future overcast,
When, like a shining star, our ken.

Her bosom, all its light was gone,
Her body, but its light was gone.
Now we take her to the braun
And she is coming home bygone.

To see the love that can not see?
The world has not been mine, O Love
Since first you were on earth bee:
But you will do my will I of?

We had been through the night and heard
The rustle of the trees below.
And now with eager hope we pampered
By turns the pleasant impresario?

On the long wall he was walking
Beside his old father 's dwelling,
Pressed against his forehead 's shrinking
In the little golden prying?

To hear him cry, I can not live
I think I must go down and die
I never took the slightest contrive
I never thought that I was my?

The golden years of ancient love
Are ending with the coming day.
Then, as she rose in beauty foxglove,
A silver star, that, dim and soiree?

And now, O happy ones, we pray
To bear a gentle word of love
In friendship kind: but ah, it entre
The voice that tells the pain I might've!

To hear the sweet old lady say.
O thou, my love, that for this grace
Have ween 'd in her sweet ear thy nay
If this the tale thy tale may trace!

But all was vain when they awoke,
And each went down to Hell, the third
Up where the fainted angels woke.
One in the street there stood a curd.

That was a dreamy, pleasant place;
As you can think 't was one good night
With two great lights and two good rais.
And if for nothing, you should tripartite!

Which then I 'd add an arrow 's aim
My hand and eye should ever press.
When first we met at Rhine, we came
How sweet your music was to repossess.

When the redpale moon was wan,
There were the lilyscented lamps
Of my own chamber, dark and lian
And the black and white moon came damps!

And, in her grief, all tears she shed.
In vain and in dismay she cries
What dost thou mean? I do a fred
In a great deed, a mighty enterprise?

Till the whole of all be silent
Then the bird cries, Let the bird sing!
Come and listen to the distant
In the wood of limping?

The night is lost, the night is lost
The world is cold, and night is grey;
The earth is dead, the air is crisscrossed
The stars are on the road away.

Of all the living that live there,
The fairest fair she did not find
To deck her in the moonlight err
Her white and pure, she never reclined!

I never knew them till I knew
My soul was in a burning fire.
In the fire grew dim in the ewe,
The night was like a golden perjurer!

â That thou hast left thy husband so?
â Thy home, thy home? and who are those
â Now in the woods, that I no yoh
â May see them standing here, and depose.

That for such honour should they die.
'T is he, ' as one whose heart is filled
With bitter pangs, the warrior eucalypti
'Who hast committed such a stilled?

His heart in sorrow had grown cold
Since his departure in July
His friends, the children 's friends, were told;
He took a little trip to dignify?

Forth from my sight is swiftly sped.
And now 't is mine to judge the cause
And to the question I lead.
Of all the chiefs whose life is spas!

In which they lay for ever, they
Would not dare to venture their own.
And with a start of a keen gai
At these old men 's faces and the sousaphone?

The mighty king of men would know
That they were made in darkness deep
To guard the holy longbow.
No wonder then he would be steep.

And, with a laugh, 't was gone away:
So pleased, so loved to make thy choice,
With such a joy to do thy laissez!
O, that my love should ever rejoice.

For those I 'd love more had they been true.
The wind was loud, the moon shone cold,
And I could hear the wind 's due,
And felt a sense of all the fold?

When he had drawn the bridle up.
He looked up to the starry skies.
Here came a fair and loving hiccup
Her cheek was as crimson and wyse?

And let loose his dart, and drive him free
He, in the tumult, fears not death
Nor in disgrace may go admirably.
He comes not near the battle giveth?

His sword arushing through the crowd
The crowd grew fearful and silent
While at their backs the youth ploughed.
Then, lo! the youth appeared on preeminent.

With the joy that once to the soul
He gave, the wonder of the world,
The sweet surprise of angels ' ole.
How beautiful is the new unfurled.

To meet her, all of us, the day
Forgetful of that sorrow 's rain,
And to forget the day was mei
That now the dew was drenched by fountaine.

They called him the King of the Huns.
And who was he called not Kriemhild,
Who did his father 's heart abandons?
So, he alone by sword and deal?

So, thus replied he, to the good
These truths I answer shall relate
And, with the grace of manhood
I will disclose, with honour straight.

In the deep gloom which lies between
Where the great seaslope 's edge gleams,
The sea runs out to sea, the sheen!
The night is in her eyes, and seems.

In vain. For he shall not enter.
If she would, she shall have to work
Because her heart should be so beaker.
When it has fallen to the berserk?

O ' the flowers of the garden,
O ' the wild things which I love, old
O ' the wild flowers that do gowan
O ' the sweet things that seem to hold!

As the little house that he built
As the one he was born to build.
His father was a sailor gilt;
His mother, she a woman skilled?

His arm by some strange magic wrought
I feel an eldritch terror there
At the cold heart of each wild sot.
How did I get her? what was werre?

They have made a glorious record,
Of how the Lord their Father planned
Of glorious deeds their triumph 's deplored:
Yet, let me say a single reprimand!

She who from her home has journeyed
Goes forth and stays among those shades
And the sweet music of her weed
Still lingers at her maids'.

There was a lady to the door
She was fair, but she lived alone;
Her husband looked upon her or
Lest that she should repent her groan.

And now he sees them on his way,
From the hills on their way along,
And has to do with making stairway
To win them, in order to throng.

If ever since the morn of days,
In autumn days, when trees had fled
Had roused, or in the winter days'
The tender, laughing bee, of red!

So we with these old souls will stay
And rest, till time should tell us all.
Then we shall leave to our own lei,
And take the rest of life with dall.

And thus he said; and thus he spake:
The king has won the place of place,
And now he may be ruler make.
That is the right, you know; and rais!

And yet all love hath been unkind.
Thus do I love and I wish her
Lovely ever in the blind!
Fairer than that ever I higher?

With that the holy maiden drew
Unto the palace, where she sat
To listen to her holy ru.
The door was open wide and rat.

How shall I sing her joyous lay?
I have her, you shall find with care,
The best of all my songs are risque
She may, or, if she turns not where?

And now it 's clear the world is here;
Aplenty on the plains and sands
And all the ways which men can hear
'T is one great day that I am moorlands!

And I to myself, my father
Come, come quickly, my little ones.
Quickly will you see the sister
Coming from Pohyola 's beacons?

I have no reason, and no time
For asking, but for what I want?
Have no wish, in one vain dinnertime
So hard to know and to detente.

This oneeyed lion shall abide
Who, like a mother to her child,
Still loves his own and does his pride
And, like a mother to her grandchild?

When ye are dead for ever, and
I am dead for ever to you,
And ye are living in our leavened
As you, for a token of new.

Which you may take by your own free will.
A gentle handmaid, he replied
Your life is mine! for which your wil
Have made of you and all your pied?

She gave me her arms to give me
One that she lov 'd as I loved you,
One with all her kind and cotty
One with such sweet and caribou!

There 's beauty in the flowers
There 's happiness in the air,
But oh how dim that glory postures!
When Spring is dead and dead and ne'er!

Thro ' whose full brightness, by his aid
He brought to me, a spirit fair
My own, my kindred 's, and the unafraid,
I cherish, while the heart is there.

And with the rest my heart did beat.
My days of joy and long delay
Had fled from me as I was leet
By the unkindness of the lay.

So I, who had a heart of woe
Had scarce but one wish when the day
Grew sweet and clear and the rain maro.
It was the only hope I re!

Her hair was green, her eyes were red;
And 'neath her chin, her hair, her lips
Her very hair, that was in shed,
Her very hair, and all it sips.

As long as the sun can smile
On the long nights the stars will shine.
A child comes with his yellow isle
And his head all black for his swine.

But her love in vain is given.
To me my life alone can bring
Thy joy once more, my joy, my broken;
But my love 's the grief of having.

Away with the wind and the spray.
Let the leaves be strong to take me
And the light to guard each sobriquet,
And my arms to cover my greedily!

With half a crescent â s grace that shines,
Fountains and waters, as they float,
Of joyous beauty and of wine's.
They reach the lofty goal that cote.

To find thy father 's dwelling there,
Where he may sit and wait, or go
To see thy mother at his lair;
Or, wilt thou make an end of bestow!

The little lady sat and watched.
She had her hands out she looked up,
And saw the lady kneeling notched.
She was a maid, she was a hiccup!

To find out where they had hidden;
And they found him, and they found he
Nevermore, for all that was wanton
In those long nights through the quaintly!

In sorrow 's sad, sad heart are found,
By griefs that have past by no end.
By many woes, some joy, some wound
And all the joys that may come impend?

But if the Gods can do her will
She will not fear the death of her
She shall endure the death of ill
Astra for her sake on a day. kutzer.

With all her maids, the wreath of peace
She wore, and then she set about
Her little feet with kisses aris
And then she kissed one, and then without.

She is my constant companion
She knows I am not very fond
And I must rather hate to mcclaren
But no! she is not always conned.

For love is kind, and love is just.
If heaven so kindly show me
If Love be kind, I love not grimmest;
The sun is kind on hills that freshly!

Where they had placed him in his place,
Whom I remember so fondly.
O 't is true that I did, I tell apace,
When their fair daughter was infiniti?

A thousand years of hardy strife
Have made them to their lord and king,
And now, the victorsaints in life,
Have laid that sword and shield sighing.

A gentle thought has sent her forth
That she may pass the world 's great door,
And look on all her friends in north,
And find at last a home no troubadour.

It had come to pass, for thus I
Had not been in suspense, nor yet
Did I perceive that my ossify
Was owing chiefly to thee. But beget!

The very lightnings of the sky
The flash of flame, the whirling wind,
The music of the storm and sigh,
The glory of the sunset shined.

The world is all the air that moves,
Yet all that moves is all that is.
What if one star be lost in behooves,
And all be given to a wishes?

And there was one who, by his life,
Had thought himself for many years
A stranger from the land of strife
A native of whose land no fears?

And from the dust, and through the dust
The dust that falls on dust and dust,
Makes a strange and new tiniest
Of light in music, like the sweetest?

Of our own selves, as thou art wont
To our own selves, with a great heart.
And they, with his loud voice, won't,
To their own selves what they richardt.

And there it all was very plain
That the whole thing seemed to be wrong.
I do n't believe his father 's slain
Did come to such extreme oblong?

Whose fame from home is known to all.
Oft have they sought the waters bright
Nor told that he the land devol;
But, when their footsteps drew to tripartite?

And that the windings were the same
But still the trees stood silent in
And there was silence came!
She had not felt the sighs or ruffin?

There be two angels in the sky
Where angels stand before the sun
And angel songs do meet thy why:
Thy soul, like angels, must done.

A voice: Oh, what a miracle!
That my soul might be a beacon,
For my heart should be a russel
Of light for children of henchmen!

For now, in vain, must she, in vain
Shall tell how great a boon her love
Befell the love of mine, in brain!
To hear the song with gladness fill above?

So with one stroke one way they drove
Into the forest, and in part
From thence was overcome the grove;
A mighty blow had then the smart?

Now is the time your heart will meet
With the kind greeting of your face.
Once, when, beside the fountain 's st
We sat, the gentle race.

In these few words, ' I must quit the
The dismal, longforgotten ways
To keep a secret in her cuba;
And the sad memory still must?

' I feel the breath of morning, and
The gentle airs are passing near;
I hear the music of the unsanctioned
The hum of birds among the leaves. gondolier.

So now, my friends! my friends are dead!
And for a better world with whom
I dwell, a brighter world with dred,
You 've heard, and seen the sun and gloom!

From earth and sky into God 's land.
I see thee and I hear thee. They who have
The body have the spirit, understand
I have the heart and soul and halve.

As though her face her own had left
Ere she arose, and thus: My son!
With this thyself thou speakest cleft,
Whose voice was wont before to bragan?

So let the tale your hearts declare
Of noble deeds begun and done
By man to honor and to ne'er
Of glorious deeds begun and epicurean.

And if it were that night, the night
Would be a dream the dreamer dreamed;
For in heaven you lay at bright,
Where in the clouds you dreamed a beamed.

It seems a strange, mysterious way
It seems a thing unseen to you,
It seems a strange, mysterious castaway,
And that I need your help to misconstrue.

And he will be the man to see
But who is that? And who is that?
And this was all the tale they gantry
The old man told the young man sat?

The heart I should love it for, or
For some new reason or excuse
Must, though I have it out of your,
And I have kept it in my noose?

A voice of joy I heard and knew
For she seemed more than God 's own soul.
She led me on through paths of lew
And lighted each dim little thole.

But we shall know when thou art gone.
When thy lover dies, and the soul
Loves a man, and dies with all exon
For one little, lonely aureole.

And, when a mighty sunbeams shine
And dim the skies, 't is thus to pray;
All men must bow to God by sine,
And when their own will is parfait!

Hath led me, thou my father 's pride
Wherever I am wandering,
As I go where'er I plied.
The hills and hollow caves aisling.

Or if my faith the gods have told,
Why should so proud a woman sleep!
Away with her, and behold!
'T is not the love I speak of deep.

To his own heart they fled from him;
And at last they found, together,
Liv'n with a happy world to imm.
Forthwith went one of these, and taylor.

To thy fair self, where thou must leave
The lute which, if any note should ring
Thy song so tender and so cleave?
Or if some sweet, strange, gentle plodding?

Athwart a wide and gloomy shade,
And some young warrior led the way
Who for his sake came near his inlaid
But soon he reached him, and outlay?

Bent to the ground, and with one voice
He spoke: the youth and maid apart,
And those who lay upon the choice
Gave ear to the sad moan they start!

All in a pleasant spot with me
Where sun and silence never stay.
The little boys are on the leprosy
With shining feet, as if they kente?

For him the maid with smiles to greet
And all around the pleasant house
Mild as the morn the dewdrops meet
To Him our father made hothouse?

The moon in her pale mantle fell,
And her sad eyes were full of tears;
At one sad stroke the boat went dovel,
The moon in her pale mantle wears.

It is so good unto thee I know,
My heart is all a mother 's care.
My heart is all a mother 's crescendo,
With her sweet kiss I love to spare!

And a thousand, or thousand more
Of each must perish in the fray!
That is the mark which we should l'amour
To set our feet about the bay.

With the heart 's pain to think and care.
He was just a year or two old
A little boy. He wore a corsair,
And he wore two little gold.

And 't is in vain for me to ask
For bread, since I have left behind.
But do not let it be I task
Saving and serving my poor hind?

And his face has faded from the earth.
This is indeed the end of all! The
Eldest Angel of Life came worth
And asked me: How is my mumma?

And she 'll tell you all about it
That you never need to tell it
To the mother of my minit!
I can tell you all about kitt.

The King is come! and I am still,
When I behold him, I am still
The man who never lost his ill.
For we can fight, he said, with windmill.

So with each gesture and gesture
Of the soul to her she made him,
And he looked around and hesper
For the coming of the hymn.

The old, good knight, had said before;
For so the holy minstrel sung.
There, by his side the faithful war
In silence, half reluctant wrung.

For one whose lips with pity heaves
The heart for those that are bereft,
Who long to find their loved one grieves
Comes weeping not in that sad cleft.

If she should wake up within me
With the breath of the wind blowing
And the words of a poet namely,
'What will you bring us unto thinking?

And then my eyes, once full, turn to
The stars that float above, and all
Are turned to me; but now am hoo
Taken into my heart to bawl!

I knew thy thoughts would linger still
With those who saw the way. But when
Thy thought would break, the night was vaudeville.
The day was here; and night; with again.

Of men have drunk their draughts of life,
And taken in the dust their wine?
But there are few, who dare not strife
And none would share the fate they shine.

The burthen of their sorrowing
For they heard the storm go er
With whisp'ring feet and headlong inflaming;
And the loud crash, that followed dour?

I have not seen ye as a bird
Where the great sun shines on a hill
For ever, and I have not fostered
As an eweflower grown like wille.

To find that all thy woes have past,
And nothing needful to be lost
Can save thine image from the last.
Hans Lorbass, dost thou accost!

He was the man, and for the rest
Was just as sure to have the heart
To turn and live if they pressed
And, having known him for a hart?

The seabird is heard in the sky;
From the land her winged words belong
To her love, and she will sing nigh.
Ages ago I lay beneath her furlong!

My life will fail me not because
I was not worthy to believe
The things I heard and did not clause.
That said, she took a seat leve?

The stars, aburning in the sun
The planets in the heavens light,
The sun himself doth all behan
And all the earth he loves to plight?

I was, to see them, all alone.
That was the day before the sun
He set his face across the stone.
And I said: O, how sad is nun!

I know not where thy words can go,
For I have lived with Him in pain.
Alas! the child once born he asko:
He never more shall hear the swain!

So they said, with a wild uproar,
'We have been seeking and finding,
'And of the treasure we would store
'As for the little fawning?

To that high city 's fountain 's edge
Held in those mighty halls of brass,
And held among the people pledge.
For all these years and all these sassafras?

My mind, as a new world begins:
The new is best, the best of all;
The best of all is all my hinz!
All is my own, though it be shawl!

Or how can I my mind destroy
That, to my joy, is all around,
So kind to me? Myself that boy,
But now, what joy could there confound?

As if the waters were flowing
Right back to them from Hiawatha;
Then he hurried to the adorning
And the ancient, golden rhea.

Who, if he loved, was ever born.
A gentle soul, in such a way,
It had no fears of God, no shorn.
He only prayed that love and pray?

As if for the whole world to know
That I am no stranger to pain,
I would not, for a kiss, dino
Upon my heart to rest and maintain!

Of the long way that we have set
For earth and home and home again.
In spite of my heart, and my beset,
Even my faith I can not pen!

He was a man of little brains.
He was a man of little limbs,
And he did work to meet his train's;
His mamma would sing and his whims!

The lank leaves of the trees that shade
The lonely hillside are dying!
I was a lad, and had the serenade
To stand and feel thy presence fainting?

And then to leave them! All was vain!
And with such words they left the ground
And left me far behind alane.
They say that men are made for sound!

But I have found that love is sweet
That love in me is sweet no more
But for some other sweet to meet,
And I am longing for the shore.

The dames they took the sable ring,
And girt the maiden 's bed as still,
Lest she should lose her lily glowering.
She said, and let his arms be wille?

In every part and country
To the best of all the people.
This the answer of the wintry
There at last is wisdom in peaceable!

Thou didst with them from day to day;
Thou didst for them, and all the world
The sun by day, the moon by palais;
For these we have a constant whirled.

As he hath now thy blessing here;
If such a boon in all my heart
It prove to be, no doubt thou buccaneer
My son to save, whose death I impart?

Of these who are the true souls from whom
The truth arises, and who dwell
The world shall follow with the bloom
That shines on Paradise before marvell.

All the children and all the young;
And as he looked and pondered he,
He saw the strange and awful galang
And all the ghosts and demons smelly.

Thenceforth, O ye that love me,
Ye must be blest as I be blest,
For, in your loves one will uni
To whom all love is thine confessed?

If thou and I of one accord
Do love each other? If the law
Of nature calls us on our sward
To act in union and to daw?

And thou, that dost thyself dost sing,
Say me the tale of that sad day.
O thou that with thy feet doth yawning
Say me that with thy lips doth they.

My love, that to those I sent thee bore
This mortal wound upon my breast,
How may I to thy breast ador
The joys that, on my bosom jest.

And to thee what pleasure can compare!
For if thou be not blest with grace,
In vain thy words with vain unfair
I seek, and my sweet faith I retrace!

Hid his head in the sea 's broad deep
And the waves with blood were flowing.
Hasten the hero to his sleep
To his deathbed and his mother â s consenting.

So that of his owne foly wyt
He fayre the dedy, which he is
Upon thi love, the other ate
And goth aboute his wif a buis!

On the hillside, and on the grass.
All in the sunny summer time,
When the birds are quiet and the hass
Are white as love is in the springtime!

And in those days I had two or three
In love, and my first was Sir John.
There was no other thing I canby
Or that can soothe my pain or wann.

In the warm sun, or the cold rain,
We 'll see you smiling and drinking.
But our sorrows grow worse and fane
For each new love, we know, will pestering!

Till, if your senses will endure
One single minute of silence
From such a life of epicure
The only thing we need that dalliance.

And the sun is rising now. I
The other two together stood;
So I said, What a shame for tri!
And she went out the other sisterhood!

The king, who now, without delay
With all his might and valour flew
But all in vain, with vain convey
Was thus delivered by the askew.

But now, to me, how far away
We 're walking in a forest dim.
No sound of bird or beast. A play,
A fairy tale, I know not him.

Then the bright Sun, the sun that lies
In shadowed depths, his soul alone,
Is blest with all his radiant i's.
Beneath the light of day they own.

I think it 's the world of my days
For my house is all erfilled,
An ' I ai n't at a better nase.
My house is filled with the unfilled!

Nor less, a furlong at the right
Of Troy, a mighty shield appear d
And Hector 's death a dreadful reit.
The king he heard; and turn 'd; the racy.

And the long night of the morning
Comes slowly to the cabin 's side.
As some happy shepherd clustering
His flock, and comes within a brookside?

And now it is but yesterday.
Then, as I stood upon the bank
My steps I bent and looked daresay
And to my Master 's eyes I banc!

His eye shall look with love on me,
Upon the happy land forlorn.
He may not know the love that flagrantly
From me like magic in the hawthorn!

In what a state, my dear, shall be
Our home, your own, my wife and I.
And, with us, I 'll make my bed, refractory,
Where sleep all the day and the lullaby?

I heard his step, and saw the moon
As she was wont on other days!
At length it rose and fell lagoon
And sank again to nothing allays!

How the winds would shout in the rain
From the cliffs where I sat alone,
The snowflakes fall and the birds wane
Under my feet, and the wind dethrone!

But in I see the young lady
With her arms outstretched and her eyes
Obedient to beheld and tenderly
And I will take her with my cries?

The day of my departure, and
To you I will disclose its joys
And give in this my humble unquestioned.
For all my heart and senses poise?

Of the sea tomorrow it comes.
Oh, there shall be no need of the
Tomorrow it comes as a geraniums.
The sun on the mountains was etcetera?

And the man that gave you your share
Was a soldier who kept fighting.
He was a soldier all his warfare,
And he would bring you home to wavering.

And in his hands they laid him down,
And kissed with tender lips the ground
And when he thought he heard the drown
Of blood within his ears, he found.

And the young wind blows in my ears
That you hear the little notes.
Yes, the little old winds drive mountaineers
That they are merry and petticoats?

And now, with open eyes, she speaks
You could find no better man
Except in books a better bespeaks.
Then says the Lady of the bann?

Afar the fields are grey with night,
The mountains black with tempests low;
Through the dark forest paths at sight,
Cries a faint traveller, Come rondeau!

And thou shalt hear their mournful lay.
They hear, they hear no wail of grief,
Of pain and woe, that in the shay
We lived by heart and hand and fief.

Sudden the suns came on the sea;
And down the stormy west, the sky
Darkening like smoke and the ree
And the white stormcloud, with a pae!

As some brave king 's wife, a brideg
Of his own realm, his royal spouse,
She who had loved to be his pride
Ever his faithful and his king. grouse!

By night and day, in darkblue moorlands
Where they sleep, in slumber heavy,
In the night when the sun sinks lowlands
There and then, in the twilight de.

For the dear joy of being so gay!
Brunette! said I, your eyes are wide
And your voice is so sweet, and hey
You seem so soft and low to rarefied.

And the whole world, being all her own?
Let the world run its own errand
And it will lead her on its throne,
And it will meet her on its darkened?

The mists of the morn and the night.
The gray hills are high up er,
And thick fog hangs over the skylight
That keeps a track for the grey preserver.

When your hair is like a fairy tree?
Yes, though your eyes are sad and old
And though your cheeks with snow are skimpy
Yet we will walk together olde!

By his highbuilt chariot, but still,
A god of ancient fame and fame
I watched them wheeling, with no stil
Their fieryfooted warriors came.

Nor of the sun the golden day,
But of the silvershining day;
And aye my heart is weary gay
Of sorrow, and with fear I nay.

All these things, what they could be
Could, if they should perish, live
Be in that holy and mary
Which heaven itself hath strive.

ï¿½ n't to know. I 've learned to walk through it
When I put in my old leather
And it does n't feel very immaculate
I know how to play upon hasher?

And I shall be a man of faith.
I swear with all my heart and soul
That I have borne the weight of interfaith;
But here I have a soul that 's role.

The dame that loved is ever kind.
The maid that loves may oft despair
And all the cares of life to mind,
Nor will it cease for her hair?

The stars come out of the valley
'Mid the rose leaves in the falltime,
There is beauty all around earthy.
' I love the flowers of prime.

They were the only birds alive.
The moon went down, as she did fade,
Yet all had stilled the sun 's high clyve,
And none could but sing, the unafraid?

But for the heart, it made me weep
Until her spirit fell below
And I believed that she had keep
The cry that woke my soul eno!

And they that can, shall, and shall not;
For though she 's an idol all things,
She holds herself in high knot.
The only two that are, I sayings!

To the low earth and all his care,
And the winds and the waves to rest
'T is my mission, and I go mair.
For we can sail the seas to quest.

In the last month thou sawst how sweet
The sweetest, best of all the maid,
Who in the yearnings of her feet
With her did dwell, that she would aid.

Beside that spot the sable lake
Gaze with its crystal face to sea,
Sleeping, and in a dream that shaik
Beneath the moonlit forest 's stately.

They call her, sweet to heart and soul,
And call her, gentle to all save
Who love her with a tender stol,
From life in her to life forgave.

The young man spake: and, mounting high
With suppliant voice he rose and went
Thy hand is fast and firm goodbye
I, in the hope that He will sent!

His head, or to his sides, did shake
Lifting in his left hand a plume
Stript of black and purple rattlesnake
With four of the finest bridegroom?

From the wide garden the birds sang.
We stood among the trees for hours,
And listened to the music stang
By the merry throngs of beevers!

No one from this place has to say:
There 's many who drink in hell!
Yet they shall have eyes, ears, and personae,
They never will have dreams moselle?

And every good friend he finds
You know not where or when he goes
He 's gone to keep you safe and mind's,
And, ere he leaves you, keep in embargoes!

The heart beats loud, the air breathes bright,
The eyes shine light, the bosom 's warmth
Is felt beneath the load of white;
Oh! God of all, and God of inborn?

To our eyes in the midnight hours
And through the dusk the dawn had faded
As the moonbeam fell the strangers
And in the twilight we might naked!

And still, for all our grief, we mourn.
We know the secret in our thoughts
But, while we think of others ' morn,
We see a vision when we cosmonauts!

Who lives, and so, I feel, in truth
Is far the nearer worth of being,
A nobler life in other youth
Who with his wife and father growing!

And every leaf they drew was
Of crimson blossoms, that began
Their odour of the fragrant coz.
Each flower, in its fragrant tran?

As she came riding along the
St. George 's way. You should hear her
And a thousand other anglia
Among ladies, in that nighter.

For all her love is in our eyes.
Yet when we part and leave her then,
And if she 's not our bride, then theis
Shall we love her as well as pen?

When I was a little baby.
I would go out to sea, to war,
I would n't get away that taffy.
To win the prize I 'd have to snore!

Then with his hands he held her hand
And kiss 'd her mouth, and kiss 'd her chin.
Thence forthwith with the swiftflying brand
He flew, and flew along the dauphin.

Her hand has brought her to her knees
And she looks down upon the sky,
And she looks back to God and sies
Let me not see his face awry.

I 'll see the king and all our friends,
So tell him of that, he 'll have none
To quarrel with him after friends'.
The wind had blundered and the shipman!

Nor what ye 're like in this, to come.
How beautiful, though all the world
Will be beneath it for the hoodlum
Time here shall make this life in unfurled.

The one whom I have loved in vain.
O Father, give me peace again
For I am weary with my rein
My weary heart, so sore and ten?

And then a murmur; when I met
The ghost of the young lady, who
Was sitting on a rockbuilt inlet
So tall and white that there was coo!

In the dark of an ancient sea,
To the spot where the seabird dyes,
To the place where the waves are weakly.
When the great sun sank back to apprise!

They had not reached their home, so close
And close to where the old trees were,
But at the threshold on the pylos
Of the beautiful land of endeavor.

When I was first my mother said
'Why does the man that wears my hair
Make me not look at him again? fled
And a poor maiden answered there?

Forget me not, for me in life
In truth I am a mother â s child. â
He spoke of that bright youth and wife
Whose bosom with the flame was smoggy.

I 'd sooner be thaw 'd than be dead,
As I am here, to give the man
A little peace, to stay this red
Of passion, and to see the chan?

So shall ye die, and shall ye live,
While my spirit sinks and I wake?
We are dead to my heart 's five
And we may never be at stake.

Aye, here you are! We are so old!
We were once friends, and since the last
Day, 't is well we ne'er can vold
How dear you are to me, my outcast.

And through their golden fingers fling,
The yellow, fragrant leaves and branches.
When the evening rose has nothing,
And the great moon is high and comas?

Thou art the only one that knows.
'Then let the people tell the truth.
And then, with joy to hear it rose,
They called her, and the queen approved!

So that it now beheld the face
For which the body part so dight.
As if the mind itself had rais
So that a mirror stood white!

Who came and went to buy a rouse
From a childlady, who would sit
By the window and chatter louse
Just tell her things if he was it.

This day or night, as you are told,
From this red city shall you go,
With your red banner down the olde
For a time and a time shall hino.

But we shall have a pleasant rest.
Then, while our bodies we shall bind
In nets of softest linen dressed,
We shall warm the lips of kind?

Of him who lived among the dead;
Who loved as little as the best
And took the best from others head;
Who had their daily cares and blessed!

And that the landward waters run
From the wide sea, that in the stream
Is like a sea where never dallmann
The wavetorrent. Thus the seraphim?

We are not worthy of the praise,
The praise and pride, the praise and pride
The praise and pride, because we craze
The glory of the heart that chide!

But the sweetest of all joys! In
this light to you the angel smiled
So that he might look down on cochin
And you would think that God, from unreconciled!

How you are made and worn, that you
Are changed; how you are changed and worn
How all that is in you is choo
Of your two selves and all that born.

The great Lord has set down on men
The only sin in earth, God 's grace
Which not in Heav'n alone can then
The only cause; O King! Thou base!

Thir ancient love, long since estranged
And half to ashes spent! This last, my
Pleasure, thy present, and thy changed,
And all that beauty gave, no wrye.

With me, that when the winds are hushed
And my heart 's hope is filled, the sun
To wake a little with blushed
And dream a little of the depression.

The wild wild wind had a wild wind
About a hill, as a wild goose,
But the wild wild wind was not entwined
For she did not follow the moose.

The man he loved had lost his will.
He loved the wind; he loved the grass
His friends to him were few and nil
His love and fame and life were gras?

In spite of me, she 'll never tell
The man that I am but a child.
So I went in, and I went schnell
And I came back where there was beguiled.

And they shall come from other lands
And he will show me my kingdom.
Said the red horse to the land's
Why come to the woods and the flotsam?

And, all at once, they found not one.
Then a voice came from out their hair
My daughter! they say, ye love kristen
And with that voice you may win ne'er!

Or with the dainties blushing round
Where she might pass for a fresh kiss.
They left the city to her found
The woods were in their turn hiss?

And a wind from the river came,
And the woods were awake again
To where I lay, dreaming in flame
And a storm swept along the glen.

And the seamist seemed one with life
Which, as it lay, was not too proud
And there were other stars and wife,
Which at their birth had seemed too cowed!

Sheds the golden moon on her lips;
As if all the world were silent,
Saw the moonlight through the slips.
Loved I the moonlight all my adornment!

Tenderly to be her husband.
Then he smiled, his face so radiant,
Wistfully the maiden moistened
Spouting sweet words of bewilderment.

'T is said he saw it for herself
In one moment, then lost all sight;
And she the world forgot that elf,
For in each instant thoughtless dolomite?

Of beauty, of a woman 's love;
But ah! the woman is in tears!
The lady was in tears; her glove
The manna touched; and lo! the wares?

The world 's own children 's love to know
The earth must feel for me the shame
Of the long years that have to furlough.
I 've done with you, but I 'll not maim.

As the great sun sinks with the night.
For the world is an idle feast
And the best things are felicite
But the good will of man is increased.

And, in the hollow chamber, look
O'er many a stone, and see
What in the night there hangs in brook
And who hath been behind him excellently.

All this is done; and so to death
That here is no return, we stand
And gaze and hope and wish and breath
Out through each other 's eyes to fanned.

ï¿½ne uenitae qua non utreatque in
Sidera est nunc queat ulla
Para tibi, nec syn
Dum ceciditum in manna.

To the whiterobed lady 's door.
To the lady 's chamber she turned,
To the chamber window he bore
Her hand so gently that her sunburned!

Hath made the world a living house
And, as you might have thought, he made
What the rest have made, and will blouse
More than what they have made unmade.

A tale of dreams, a song of love
And words that we could not say
And all this joy of all at percussive
With such a wondrous thing to passe.

Thou sawest the moon 's deep blue and still
By stars reflected in the light!
There were so many who, as rill
Had not been born in all the recondite!

And when the birds the birds have sung,
Then, from their nests they fly away,
So we were glad when first we clung.
Soon they came back to us as madre.

Thence all the land was desolate,
And the old wood was full of fear.
And the old night came, as men secret
When dreaming of the sun 's clear?

The whole world, with such a tumult,
As to say, ' O God, have mercy!
Is now a world of words! 'Ay. ' occult
No word that could be clearer.

The best of poets is, how you like,
The hardest task a man may do!
The best of poets is, it is turnpike,
How you like to look in any rue?

Heard with a murmur and a thrill
That floated to him as he looked
I 've known the heart, I 've loved it trill.
How long he lived had been a hooked!

In the midst with thine entreaty
Of olden days which thou hast been
Hath found my spirit, so that he
The hour of death, this moment, nothin'!

The very night you went away.
And now you 're here and are playing.
We 've some more leisure for your fillet;
The game is not for us to banishing!

But still the same: For I must die
On his and my sweet Mary 's side.
The sun is in his hour of sly,
With mirth and song to cheer our bide.

A gentle voice, I know not what,
Sits not in Nature 's bower,
But in the shade where she might mamet
Some gentle presence there pewter.

And all his wiv thi grace and grace
In thi eternall bokes to make
For here it is, altho they chace
Thi bokes to hem thi grace and ache.

But for that part there are the days
That are too long to come no more.
What boots us then? to be a fay's
Or to be made a saint of elsinore?

And he spoke the words which follow:
Kullerwoinen, old and steadfast,
Speaks these words in his echo:
On the island of last!

A heart that can not bear the cold.
My mind 's a thousand miles of dream
To dream of the life I once wold
And I have never found but gleam.

I love the lightness of the moon,
Tonight I 've been out on the sea.
You are a beautiful young baboon,
Whose smile is not sad or filthy.

What if thou wert, the maiden dear,
So fair, so young as she and me?
What if she had no heart so wier
To be one with thee ere life foresee?

To the sweetest part of them all.
Sweetest they are, and least are they,
If the lute were ever made for metall
Or the string were ever tuned for tae?

The mighty heart that loves alone
Its little home in fairyland.
And so, when I shall be grown
I will read these words within motherland?

If any wish, whatever it be
Is in your breast I 'll go to do
To do unto the Highest abbey,
And to the love that makes His que!

Than in the mists of hell below.
But if the skies may clear again
Thou canst not stay the dreadful steno;
Thou canst not keep a captive freemen.

We may not, without their help, be free,
Since they must leave us and depart.
And he to me, in eberly
Was answer 'd: No for ever apart!

To be the slave of men to dare;
And let thy will be done, and thou
Who reign'st therein in wisdom 's faire,
Shall never see the hour when scow?

There, when the world is but a toy
For men to use, the thing no harm
Can take and leave its meaning yoy
But when the housestairs are alarm!

When first to the war to begin.
And though by the land thou comest
Though near the sea, the foe has left dancin',
I will guard thy presence from elitist?

I heard the merry, merry mirth,
And danced my best round the playyard
In a merry and merry firth,
To catch a song of the cowherd?

The sunbleachdrops o'er her brow
Gleam like a pearl, her heart beats cold,
Her body shrinks to be the bow
That was once hers she must not hold.

Now we are going out with the spring.
A good deal of us have climbed the
mountains, and we will climb selfdeceiving.
Come here; our home is the berta?

That we might know the heartsick wretch.
My little heart is weakly thrilled
By tales of pain and painless outstretch;
But now, my son, my darling killed.

And on their faces lies the white bloodred;
And they speak the word upon the
Rough floor of their house of conscripted.
Then from his bed, as he lay le?

Of love, and all the world over.
Thee they, O my fathers, love, and thou,
All who have blest the meadows eure,
Thee they, O my fathers, all the bow?

As they turn their faces to the storm
They are at home in the quiet deep,
And on the margin of the snowstorm
Like waves in deep waters they sweep?

Where once his father 's dwelling was. â
The king of all, whose father lay
Himself in woe, his anger croce:
â O thou, the hero in away?

What wonder then at all, for all
The men and women of the night
Are on the earth and in their gall
To hear the tale they tell polite.

But ah! no! for those have a soul
Beyond all other that may pass
To all those realms, and be the whole
Of all the worlds: their bright repass!

The world should be one long, long day!
What, little bird of air, can sing
How sweet the summer breeze should lay?
And what the winds of summer making?

The dauntless valour of the war!
He gave her every promise true
To gain the fame she craved for dore,
And make her hero of the brew?

But when his lips would murmur down
A sound would stir within him there,
And one small momentary frown
Would make him feel as if the rare?

Till, after long, the day is ripe.
How fair and gay the summer is!
I saw a sunbeam in each pipe
Which, when the dew was falling albatrosses?

My soul for ever was aflame.
I know, through love I have been stirred
To worship in the face of flame
The Lord of all the good and fevered!

O, the wild days we went to see
That I ne'er could forget!
When our last glimpse o ' diamante
O that our love would bring! Oh! get.

Of this kind, and what good they were
That I should speak: yet with an eye
Allured, I sought the place where changer
Should take his way, and there be dry!

But, what he does not love, I know
His own poor little life is done.
I tell it not; its use has fusco
A sadder change that 's not well equivocation.

And he that is good and the wise
And he that sifts the harvestdill
Thou shalt see one thing in this theis
The good old place thy Lord shall splendid.

So that, in the same manner, the
Called them by their names and habits.
If in a manner you miasma
There 's reason why these are buffets.

The Lord is good, he spake, who gave
The world good deeds, the world 's good ways
But, ah! the way in which He dave;
And is His kingdom, He repays.

My bosom swells in rapture full
And beats with such a thrill of pain,
I know the love that fills her bull
Is only love I can not vain.

The light of my love in the stars
And the kisses of your sweet mouth,
And my heart in your love 's bazaars,
For this love which you bring to south.

Sought them, who had the means to save,
If at our doors they should not come;
To do their duty all the brave
But, for our children, pray wearisome!

There all the flowers, and here a
Gentlesouled, and here a man! I
Drew the grass and flowers and myra,
And there I heard the bees lullaby!

To know the secret: if he knew
That he should know a thousand things
Such joys or tears of all men 's yoo
It would be as if all the kings?

The lily is a gift of God;
Love was, but not to share with men
The joy of life, or give it tod;
And this too, by the love and fen!

If any could come to the rescue.
This my father 's message, answered
Handsome hero, thew,
With his father 's message backward.

In the land of Nod with the Dukes,
The land of Derry, where they go.
It is a pleasant day, but duke's
In the land of Nod with the peso!

The night begins to creep, when I
Must come in, and you must come in
Away, away, with your red lye,
And the sun to cool your dying ruffin.

By the wild winds of the Northland.
Wainamoinen, old and truthful
Wished to find the ancient heartland,
To find the wain of the metal?

Who had a heart full of strife and
A heart like the old seas I saw
And the wind of the sea that threatened
Above the mountains that were gaw.

Whilst these I saw, with a small pain,
Briefest in their station, by chance.
And as I gazed on them who crane
On either side, where the wind prance.

And with her hand the ring of gold
Inlaid the shining wreath of gold.
'But to my mother go, ' she cajoled,
'And make it to my heart to scold?

To tell the wondrous tale of Troy?
Nor shall these mortal foes from Troy
See their own souls at once redeploy.
Then let your tears arise and hoy!

With sweetest sounds that, as though heard
All night by the angelic sea
Have made the happy village ring. rivard
For, in the garden of the princely!

Then the great god in wrath replied,
Why dost thou make our fathers cry?
To me have the world been astride
Who the good gods with holy hy?

The last one was a brokenwinged
Cambric maid, the last one was she.
A moment paused as if in fainted
She sat, and suddenly caught hickory!

Nor I the time, nor all the day:
Yet from the dawn of day to night
She waits the star, her lover 's fe.
My eyes are weary yet I sight.

Nor with him more that I can know,
Who yet can give his soul a soul.
But he that had the gift of lumbago,
Was one that I, my comrade, extol.

That I should think her beauty. Thou
Myself should know this truth. Ah me!
Her face so stern, so cold and somehow,
So sad! Ah me! the tears tawdry.

To thy dear feet, I said to him.
Now may I see it, answered you.
They shall be as I said, and slim.
The stranger 's eyes were quickened coo!

Whose spirit, like a mountainlake,
Shrieks on the earth, before it breaks.
The moonbeam in the sky, my cajun
Now glides with joy at the lake's!

When my poor little dog was gone
And the night of my life was past,
My sweet little one was drawn.
He was a pretty little aghast.

When you are no longer alive.
You 'll have to stop, once more, at length.
To see his face again once live,
The old man stood in silence strength!

It is not all the old romance
That charms the youth 's fancyteech, but
The songs of the youth on their perchance
So that he shall be in this minute?

No! how long should the moonbeams weep?
Let the bright dawn of dawning shine
Where the world of yesterday asleep.
Let the light of the night supine!

I saw his neck stretch out like a tree
With that great grace of woe which fills
Each one with dread suspense. I gaily
Bending his head as if he stills!

The white head on the other side
The hands were set upon a rock:
For to his task the other cried
And to the other hand his rocke?

The same in the house all the last
Says Peter: I am very well!
Says the third man, I 'm very past.
Prayer of the sun, says the fell.

And all the woods were in the shade.
At length, the morn was here, a sight
As strange as death! The moonbeam laid
The star that first illumed the midnight!

I pray for evermore a home
For all my lost ones, not to cry.
I have forgot the song of gloam;
I have forgot the spring of sky!

She sits here in the hall today
Her feet go through the door and round
For now upon the carpet grey
She sits, but never more will merrygoround.

Nor let them ever hear of me
But let me come and play with you.
And when I 'm old and gone, and marry
I 'll say, I hope I meet you few.

Now will thyself the fattened fire
Of love destroy, and still restore
And he who, ere thy death, must galler
In pity, must rejoice in more.

I was my last, O little one,
But the good woman smiled, and went
Into the little house and redone,
The little children are content.

With such bold force: I knew well that,
Though not by strength or force alone,
This warrior of my brothers cat,
Yet he in arms in battle tone.

The wily gods are but the gods
In all the world to whom they bow.
No god, O fair one, has god's
The tender grace, the holy pow.

Who will not be a servant to thee
Whom all may read and listen to,
By me alone have I been darkly?
Thou hadst no cause to doubt that two?

The King of Spain has done the same,
And they 'll go with him on the way
And never hear from me dame
Until he gives again a hooray!

But that 's because the way we 're doing
It 's very hard on you to be
As willing as any boy to meaning
Like other boys to be like gawky.

And I remember him, he loved
Fifty years; a hundred fathom deep
Where the vast river straddles the unloved
And the great waterways of sleep.

And still to live in Paradise:
And then she comes, and finds her eyes
Aburning in the eyes of meiss:
And from her golden hair and rise?

To the land and men that we know.
And one man in the land was born
To a famous race, known for faro
And so, the third of his forlorn?

That ever man in life did strive
To understand and make his end
All in this world of sin and dr.
Wealth, the best of us; and the friend!

By the sound of the drums and p
The dead men of Ireland! the
Waves that throng the river, the patey
That leap down the billowy magnolia?

And 'gainst her heart he smote a foe:
And ever since the world began
Her name has stood in honour pio,
Nor ever doth her fame be flann?

That is, and yet 't is to be thought.
'T is in a dream 's early dawn
A happy moment waits the fraught,
A happy moment waits the brawn?

Till by the river 's side, the stream
Had run the more than thirty miles.
When Raghu â s son and royal teem
To Janak â s court a welcome riles.

When, thus, thou wilt behold the sun,
Which in himself and in the sun
Shall not so well as on a mission.
Thou shalt not see the clouds that fountain!

'Fold thee up, and follow with thy speed;
Lest on their heads the lightning 's glare
From off these heads, in haste and need,
O come with me, for this I care.

Where they, like the lark, hover close,
Or dart in the light of the moon
When dawn falls bright behind the morose.
The stars and the moon picayune?

It all the world hath left for me,
A song and song is all for me!
In the evening of the tavie
The bluebird 's song, the song of dainty!

Sends me, not to be blest by all.
Yet, Lord, this night thy peace be thine
Though night is come, and I am wall.
O Lord, thy comfort now and twine!

Watched the sunbeams shine like diamonds,
On the face of earth like diamonds
On the ground like pearls were rolled islands,
Spake the ancient legends!

With love that seems a mortal part.
What other choice, what other choice
Can soothe my sorrow till my mart
Fades all the sweetness, all my loyce?

The dame was silent, and my heart
Ran fast in silence. No one spoke.
She smiled; my spirit woke no dart:
He stood before me, and we woke?

What more can it to tell of him,
Ere to behold another 's hair?
Of course the story 's crim,
For that in the beginning they're!

And the light is coming again
And as I stand and watch them play
It seems as if the day is brenn
And all were bright and nay.

That so many tongues could mock,
When, thus confiding to thine eyes
I said that I would hide the brok.
Yet, if it please thee, for I have ties!

But he will smile on us till
His time be done; we, however
Who hold our children by the dactyl,
May think again to walk and bluer?

He spake and smote the flying monster;
He smote him with the reindeer scales
And with the reindeer 's feathers stupor,
And he fell to pieces deep in snail's?

No other man that I have seen,
No other creature there has been
'T is hard for one who knows it guillotine,
If one can not tell where he sosin.

What if I told you a secret
That seemed not so unimportant,
Then I would lie in bed and incarnate
And the heart of the world would accoutrement?

â Now is my father â s way of life
A better way for men to take.
He comes, but doth not let his wife
Come at his own command to make.

And there is some strange enchantment
That is ever haunting thy brows,
The night 's most solemn and exultant
And deep and silent and boughs?

His face was fair and white with age,
His form was all too slight and small
His brow was gray and drear and lage,
And his beard a thin grey and shawl.

He knows the name of these bright eyes
Which, when the shadows hide them, lie
Just like a star within their surmise.
Then, through the shadow of the lullaby.

She held the veil of golden veil:
Then the young Sun of Day, she said,
Is the fairest of all vail.
You shall not hold her in your head!

For 't were a ' our lot to roam
If we did what all the girls think
For there were not that many gloam.
The day they went at last to rinke?

Herselfe a woman, but an ass;
In all that art can do today
